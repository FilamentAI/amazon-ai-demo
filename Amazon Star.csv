1," I didn't expect much from the MPOW E-Clip if I'm honest (Model: MCM14). I've purchased simple car mounts like this for years and I normally just buy the cheapest one I can find on Amazon or eBay.I went for the E-Clip as it was one of the best selling models. It didn't disappoint. I love how quickly and how easily the mount extends to accommodate a smartphone. I was able to put my 5.7"" Google Nexus 6P phone in with ease and there was still lots of room left.The mount feels secure so I do not expect my smartphone to ever pop out unexpectedly.Don't let its simple design fool you. This is a quality item that should last you for years.",5
2," I have previously owned two shavers: a rotary one and a foil one. A foil shaves closer than a rotary, but if you are the swarthy type like me, skipping a shave for more than 2 days leaves you with bristles too long for a foil to cut, so the fall back is the rotary. The rotary can cut longer bristles, but never cuts as close as a foil.With the 9040s the distinction blurs. Although it is a foil shaver, it can handle long growth with no problems whatsoever (so I can bin the rotary).  In fact, I can bin any other shaver I have ever owned (about 3 so far) and also my manual shaver.The 9040 not only gives me the closest dry shave I have ever got from any electronic shaver, it has also done it in less than a minute (my current foil shaver, a Braun Series 3: 340s - takes about 2-3 mins).Best of all, the 9040 never once pulled my hair or felt anything other than smooth, even with 4 days worth of growth.It is actually the best razor I've ever used.Bad points? Well not many. It is heavier, larger and nosier than the 340s (which is a best seller and a more usual size and weight), but you expect that because the 9040 is clearly more powerful. It is also expensive. Perhaps less so for me when I consider that it is replacing both a foil and rotary razor, but still on the steep side. Oh, and the box contents seems a little sparse for what is a top end model.Overall though, any issues are minor. The 9040s is what it purports to be: an expensive shaver but also one of the best you can buy.",5
3," I received this Razor to review. I've tested quite a few in the past. This one shouts out ""different league"" as soon as you open the box. It is just a lovely well-crafted bit of engineering. It's smart, elegant and very likeable. So I created a video to honour it with a bit more effort on my part.",5
4,4 year old loves this tablet as do two old kids!,5
5,"5 Stars. Almost 4 but I couldn't bring myself to lower the score just because it doesn't come with a protective foil guard.I have had more than my fair share of razors now over the years. I tend to judge all of them by the Merkur I use on the weekend. If you know what that is, then you know the high standard I have.So, worst electric shavers I've had are Phillips.The circular cut always seems to promote ingrowing hairs, I don't know why, but there it is.Remington: 'As close a shave as your razor or your money back',..well, they were never that good, but not bad, and one of my favorites until I tried the Braun 340s. An absolute gem of a razor. It would cut through 4 days growth like a hot knife through butter. I charged it once a week and never had any issues with it running out on me. If there was one downside to it, like a lot of shavers, it struggled slightly with very short growth.So, now I've been trying the new Series 9 9040s, wet and dry shaver.First thing to notice, it feels big, very big and yet is only slightly larger than the 340. I think it's the head, easily an inch wide, that gives it this feel.I was slightly skeptical the head was too large, would an inch of cutter be too large to get into all the tricky bits...needn't have worried.This is another gem of a shaver from Braun. And at currently almost 5 times the price of the old 340s it would need to be.It takes over from where that razor left off and effortlessly handles any size of growth.You have in the head 2 banks of foil cutters sandwiching a 'Hyper Lift & Cut trimmer' (specifically designed for the neck and chin) and a 'Direct & Cut trimmer' (designed for hair that grows in different directions. It really is a formidable array of cutting equipment to put against your face, but the swivel head and rocking foils makes it very pleasurable. All the problem areas of hair (those bits that you seem to have to go over 3 times) get sorted once!Oh, it's water tight to 5 meters! This made me laugh, as who is going to shave underwater...and then I wondered if anyone had ever dropped one in the bath or down the pan?Shaving seems to be over so quickly now.This really is the best shaver I've come across that gives the Merkur a run for its money.Anything else?You get a small brush. I thought it interesting that this time round they warn you not to use it on the head mechanism, only on the base area, use water for the head.A small bottle of oil for the sandwich filler if you wash the razor a lot when cleaning.You also get a hard-ish carry case, which is nice to lay the shaver when not in use, and your bog standard lead. It's the same as my old Braun lead, so I didn't even bother unwrapping that.The manual shows you that this is the poor relative in the Series 9 range. If locking heads, trimmers, battery bars weren't enough, the higher models give you digital readouts from 9 mins to empty battery as well as a cleaning station that makes use of its sonic ability!Lastly...the box. Now that is slightly strange, but again, I'm not marking this product down for that. The box opens up backwards? You sort of get to it by opening up the back panel, it doesn't feel right and I turned it over an over, but there really is no other way into it.",5
6,5th one I've bought...great tablet!,5
7,"6 year old daughter loves it and so do i! So much entertainment choices for tv series, movies, books, games, etcAll the parental restrictions are brilliant and you can set time of use for kids e.g no access after 7pm.The protective cover does the job and makes it comfortable to hold.",5
8,7.60 seems a bit expensive for what seems a little bit of plastic.  But.  And it’s a big but.  It works.  Well.  I have used and broke a lot of cheap phone holders.  This one feels good and it works well.  The movements are smooth.  Some of the mechanism is metal which is good compared to the cheap plastic alternatives.  Only time will tell but I like it.  So much I bought another for my wife’s car.,5
9,A bit expensive bin bags do just as good of job. But would reccomend and would buy again,5
10,"A bit of an impulse buy for a Christmas present, but absolutely delighted with the earrings.  Very pretty and sparkly and sure to look impressive when worn.",5
11,"A bit tricky to fit at first - the men in the house still can't manage - once its up to cuts out about 95-99% of light so really does do the job, just get a girl to fit it!",5
12,A brilliant Amazon product - grand daughter has so much to enjoy from it!,5
13,"A brilliant product if you need to add a blackout blind to a room. It has resolved the problem of blacking out a room with patio doors as the blind just covers the area and prevents the light from coming in. Also great for travelling. They do need to be stuck using the suckers to glass though, if you try and stick them to uPVC or wooden frames then they fall off. It's easiest to dampen the sucker before pressing it against the glass as this creates a firmer attachment",5
14,"A fantastic, close and comfortable shave.  Much better than the previous 7000 series.  The cleaning/charging station amazingly also works as advertised and leaves the razor like new, which was a pleasant surprise as manually cleaning an electric razor is always a bit hit and miss.Only downside so far is the rather basic side trimmer which could have been far better executed in the design if it was sharper, more efficient and positioned at a better angle for use.",5
15,"a first class shaver, well recommended, thank you.",5
16,"A god send! Wish I'd purchased sooner! My little one used to take about an hour or mor to settle of a summer evening, now he's asleep within about 15mins. It says to stick to windows but it works just as well on the plastic fascias also providing even more black out. Great sizing to fit all windows!",5
17,A good 6 months in this is absolutely solid. Works like new and grips my mobile (Galaxy S8+) perfectly. Highly recommended,5
18,A good alternative to a windscreen mount!,5
19,"A good product  I am sure it helps a learning difficulties man with a longer sleep,, as he can't tell the time, and this time of the year he thinks its time to get up when it gets light at 4am. \thanks very much, quick delivery,.",5

31,"A quality shaver, this is the updated one to the one I previously owned. It gives a close smooth shave and the battery life is excellent. I have recommended it to family and friends. It is expensive but you can see where the money has been spent",5
32,A stocking filler that went down well.  Looked great and passed the first wear tests with no problems.,5
33,"A super shaver, but what more do you expect",5
34,"A terrific shaver. I use it wet with shaving gel and get a close and very gentle shave.  And it's impressively quick.This is my second Series 9. I had one without a cleaning station but the battery stopped holding its charge inside the warranty period. Despite the problem, I was impressed enough to buy another - this time with the cleaning station, which works well.I recently bought a Braun Series 7 for traveling.  I find the larger head on the Series 9 follows the contours of my face a little better but in every other way, the Series 7 feels just as good to me.",5

I’ve never looked at the tablet seriously before as I didn’t realise you could get access to YouTube & Netflix etc!  But I was wrong! It’s like an iPad, only more child friendly! The games are great too! My 7 year old thinks it’s cool & my 2 year old is starting to navigate her way around! It’s so light & the case is so robust.

69,"Absolutely perfect! Installed within minutes. A blackout blind, that actually does what it's suppose to do. HIGHLY recommend this blind.",5
70,"Absolutely stunned with the performance of this razor. The ease in which it cuts is fantastic and it's at least twice as quick as my previous Braun. The razor even speeds up as it encounters longer/thicker stubble, amazing power.The charging/cleaning station is excellent. When I removed the razor after it had finished, it smelt great and almost surgically clean. I can't stress just how good this razor is. Might seem expensive, but I can now appreciate all the technology that's gone into this. I've even used it for my shaven head with a 3 day growth. Went through it with ease. Now that's the test for me. Without doubt the best razor our there.",5

74,Actually a great wee product,5
75,"After fumbling around with my old broken car phone holder for a few months I decided to finally get an upgrade. It was super easy to slip on your air vents and simply opening the clips allows the phone to be placed in there no problem at all. I prefer this model rather than the dashboard ones as they take up half of the windshield and I find myself looking at my phone more than the road.It has the ability to spin around 360 degrees which allows you to put your phone at any angle that you wish. Unlike some others that I have tried, the phone stayed in nice and snug and didn't slip down at all so there is no need for readjustments at all. I use it for directions while going from place to place in a busy windy city.Suitable for any smart phone size (have tried an iPhone 6 and iPhone4s) and couldn't be happier. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a small and steady holder.",5
76,"After looking for temporary solution to my lack of curtains and realising that my windows were too wide for telescopic rails, I found this and it works perfectly. Blocks out the majority of the light and is very easy to set up.",5
77,"After reading reviews from independent review sites hailing this unit, I was surprised that it cost under a tenner.  I cautiously purchased it, not expecting much but the product is top notch and works perfectly. Holds phone securely, and does exactly what you want it to do. I'm using mine on a Kia Sportage, but the simple and effective fixing mechanism I'm sure will fit any car well.",5
78,"After researching lots of different pumps I decided to go with Lansinoh. I have not been disappointed. Easy to set up and use, I have been able to express 3oz in about 15mins each day which then husband uses to do a night feed. Not too noisy and easy to assemble after sterilisation. You can vary the settings to suit you and I have found it comfortable and quick to use, I've even expressed one breast while baby feeds on the other - saving me some milking time!",5
79,"After smashing my iPad screen for the 2nd time, we decided to buy my 2 year old this. She loves it! It took me a few minutes to get used to it as we use iPads and Samsung tablet.It has everything she watches on it and now watches other things that she hadn’t before. God send and peace and quiet for us for 10 min. Only down fall would be that the case doesn’t allow for it to stand whilst sitting on a table so we just use something for it to lean against. Perfect for a toddler who obsessed with peppa pig!",5
80,After using a hospital pump I am pleasantly surprised at how effective and compact this item is,5

120,"Amazon are amazing, this is simply genius.Using the parent settings, I have made a safe, fun learning environment for my 3.5year old non-verbal ASD ADHD son. He can't get on the web, or onto well known dangerous video sites. ALL he can do is play what feels like an endless selection of fun, safe educational games. So easy to set up, a couple of games I found he didn't like the noises on have been blocked with ease, the parental control on this is second to none. My older child, many years ago managed to turn my phone into a different language, not with this tablet, it's amazing. Very simple to use, even though he cannot read, he swaps and changes between apps with ease, the age range seems excellent. I have had other devices when setting the age has had games for 3 year olds requiring them to read fluently, thankfully, Amazon is amazing and this is properly set to the appropriate age. I can not recommend this highly enough.I have four children, aged 3-11, and will be purchasing one each for the other three, I have checked mock profiles for all of them. The selection of books, TV shows, apps and games is brilliant, When looking at the web browser for my eldest child, it was well presented, giving him options of science, maths etc. very educational, and fun!",5

152,"As a Military Officer I have to shave every day, and despite using several electric razors in the past, have struggled to find a product which shaves close and gives me the finish which I need.  My previous razor was a Braun Series 5 and although it was the best of those I had previously used, it still struggled on the neck area and left me with razor rash.I researched the multitude of available electric shavers and settled upon the Brain Series 9.  It arrived in a sturdy travel pack and charged in approximately 45 minutes from empty.  I prepared the razor using the in built wash lotion and allowed it to glide effortlessly over my face, removing all stubble with relative ease.  It shaved the neck area in its entirety and left my face feeling smooth and with no razor rash.I do choose to clean the razor in the charger after every use and a cartridge last approximately 4 weeks; however, it is a small price to pay to experience the closeness of the shave every morning.  A delight to use.",5

163,"As i write this review its currently the British Summertime, it's not getting dark until at least 9pm. Junior goes to bed at 7 and it might as well be midday. Added to this his light curtains let through the sunlight making bedtime a frustrating process. In the winter we taught him that dark meant bedtime now he's really confused why we want him to go down when its still light!A friend suggested we try a blackout blind. A quick search on Amazon and we spotted the Gro anywhere blind. Having previously bought the fantastic Gro Egg we knew that Gro was a trustworthy brand.The blind comes in a small travel bag which is great to use to keep it in storage or for when our little one stays at Grandad's house. On inspection the blind is really thick and blocks the light out like it should do. We had a few small gaps of light shine through the sides but some careful maneuvering of the cups and we blocked out all the light. The suction cups stick well to our windows, some other reviews have mentioned they have had issues but we've not had a problem in several months of use.From the outside the blind can be seen but its not offensive, we leave it up constantly rather than take it down each day.Now bedtime really means bedtime! No more battles and bedtime and no more early early mornings.",5
164,As it says very good for when our grandson comes to visit. Good quality and adapts perfectly for different size windows.,5
165,as the days are longer. kids woulsnt sleep without it.a must have,5
166,"As we regularly go on long car/train journeys we needed something to entertain our 4 year old. This is perfect. She can play games, draw watch films listen to music. To also have such a great guarantee on it gives us real peace of mind especially as we have a very......spirited one year old.",5
167,"As you should expect for the price this is probably the best electric razor you can buy today. This is my 4th Braun Razor, and with the exception of my last one (a Braun Series 7 745 Pulsonic) I've been very happy with all of them. The let down on the series 7 was it's terrible performance on anything more than a couple of days growth and the lack of drying on the clean and renew system. This series 9 rectifies those two issues completely.Set up is very simple, in the box you have the Razor, a nice case, the clean and renew base unit, a clean and renew capsule and a charging cable. The Razor just needs a charge and it's good to go. The first thing to note about the Razor is the size of head, this model has an extra set of cutters which are there to trim longer growth so you have 2 foils at either end and 2 cutters in the middle, this makes the head rather large. I'm lazy, I tend to go 4-5 days without shaving which makes a large challenge for a razor as my beard by this time is about 4mm. On first use I was seriously impressed by the performance of this razor, it made light work of the facial aspect of shaving, under the chin and the neck was more of a challenge due to the varying directions of hair but it still coped better than anything I've used previously. After use it was back to the base unit for a clean and renew, if you've used this before it needs no explanation, if not it's a revelation as your razor head will be cleaned and restored to brand new in half an hour or so, this unit also dries the head so there is no residue from the fluid.In summary, this is probably the best electric razor around today but it does come at a price, before my series 7 my previous Braun lasted 9 years without a hitch, should this do the same 300 quid is probably fair but it's a lot to stump up in one go, it is new though so in a few months market competition will hopefully bring this down. The shaving performance is better than anything I've come across but as a result the head is large and some may find this an inconvenience for smaller areas such as the top lip. I do have one slight gripe and that is the finish of the razor body, that silver body isn't metal but chromed plastic and that is a bit of a disappointment for a top of the range product, particularly at this price, it's not enough enough to knock a star off but it's worth mentioning.",5
168,As you would expect from Amazon Kindle.,5
169,At 1st the suction cups would not stick properly on the window but I followed the instructions : I cleaned the window and I have moisted the suction cups. It now works perfectly ! I'm really pleased with it.,5
170,"At first I was sceptical of the value of this tablet, but given everything that is included, the ease of use, the ability to set controls on usage, and the profiles makes this a great buy for children.So good, come Prime Day I will probably buy another so the children have one each.",5
171,"At first I wasn't sure whether to buy this one or the medela one. Decided for this one as it is less expensive and the tube has a closed system which means no liquid gets to it.Very happy with my purchase, it is efficient and means I can express milk a lot quicker than with a manual pump! I was able to express 100 ml in 20 min! I needed at least an hour with the hand pump.The cable is big enough to be able to sit comfortably on the sofa while plugged. The noise is not too bad either! Overall very happy! I am glad I chose this one!",5
172,"Awesome little device. We upgraded from the smaller, older 7"" SD fire to this 8"" HD version and it's almost as good a tablet as those well-known fruit-themed versions for adults to use. Decent speed means you're not spending much time looking at loading screens. The fact we can add different profiles so that the adults can use it, is a huge plus.The subscription to prime kids is perfect, I can't recommend this highly enough. All content is available, there is no ""daddy can we buy this pleeeeease"" because it's all available.Love the slider controls which enable us to tune the content available for my childs age. The additional timer controls also mean you can limit use and it's not ""naughty mummy or daddy"" taking the device away, my boy just hands it back saying ""oh, time's up"" with no further arguments.We can also make sure they read books for a given amount of time before the video/apps are available and this has helped my child grow to love reading (although at the time of writing there seems to be a bug which has stopped this working properly)Battery life is very good, we seldom have to charge this, although we do limit use to just over an hour a day - probably once a week is all we need to do.All in all, this is a great, inexpensive way to introduce children into the sometimes scary-world of online entertainment.",5
173,"awesome product, my grandson loves it.",5
174,"Awesome tablet ,,at least kids are more safe online",5
175,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Close and comfortable shave, really stunning looking shaver, and little trimmer on the back too. Also - and this is great - comes with liquid and a little dock where it runs a cleaning cycle. Fantastic. It's expensive but it's a truly stunning bit of kit.",5
176,"Awesome, keeps kids entertained without the worry of buying lots of apps. Some really good apps on there too including the Lego Harry Potter games and huge range of books to read as well. Best tablet for kids by far",5
177,Awesome. Perfect for when you go away with your little one. Can't recomend enough.,5
178,Awesome. Really like it. It's my son's but I pinch it all the time.,5
179,bad man ting ... 10/10,5
180,bargain of the year get loads of comments on them from strangers,5
181,Bargain tablet and overall package for kids. Just a pity that you cannot add YouTube kids to a child's profile but still 5 stars for me.,5
182,Bargain- works great,5
183,"Bargain, absolutely beautiful pair of earrings x",5
184,"Be Patient! When this arrived I felt very dissapointed to be honest, because It's hard to stick the joints to the window! and it felt down, I am thinking about send it back or just thrown it away, but then I thought I give it another try and used a little bit of water over the joints and it works! after a few days it stuck to the windows very easy and I begin to love it! no more bright light inside my room!",5
185,"Beatiful petite earings, very shiny.",5

208,Beautifull,5
209,Been using brauns for years and this was another upgrade and as usual the difference was noticeable.,5
210,"Before I got this, I was doing odd things to black out light. I would hang all sorts of things, towels, sheets, dressing gowns, over curtain rails to block out light. I even selotaped sheets to walls to block it out. Ignoring any potential issue with me aside, this product works fantastically.Easily sticks to windows, with the holders close enough together so that it creates a proper black out. Has enough fabric around the holders too so it truly prevents light coming in. Also easy to pack up and carry around. Recommend for all who have trouble sleeping with any light present.",5
211,Best Buy ever for my 4 year old son! He loves it.It is not as easy to use as a regular iPad but we slowly but surely working out how it use it. It looks good and travels well. Love the sturdy blue case! Perfect for our up coming holiday!,5

223,Best phone holder I've had.  Really easy to fit and doesn't move around like my previous swivel one did.,5
224,"Best phone holder you can buy, its also better then the ones you have to put on your car window, would deffo buy again, if needed xx",5
225,"Best present I’ve bought so far! Love all the learning apps, child safety features and the foam case makes it almost indestructible!! Minor points are the charging port becomes quite loose fairly quick and charger has broken after 4 months, amazon replaced charging lead quite happily.",5
226,Best present we were given and now we are continuing the tradition for all new borns. Great to travel with.  We use it every day.,5
227,Best product for summer! Even want to buy one for our bedroom. So brilliant and it could be used for most windows. Use some water to wipe the edge if it doesn't stay so tightly.,5
228,Best razor I have ever had,5
229,best shaver ever bought so good  and very good cleaning system with it another amazon quality product,5
230,Best shaver ever. If you want all hairs removed then this shaver is for you. So easy to handle and only takes one hour to charge. Also the clean and dry system is great which cleans your razor for the next shave. Glad I purchased this item. There should be no hesitation with buying this shaver. It easily beats all the previous series!,5
231,Best shaver i have had.,5
232,"Best Shaver money can buy, I cant even feel the shave, too good :)",5
233,Best shaver there is for sensitive skin.,5

239,best vent based holder ever,5
240,better than the old one,5
241,"better than the ones i bought a few weeks ago from Stansted airport services at twice the price  holds vents and phone very well, double opening arms makes it easier to remove the phone.",5
242,Beutiful,5
243,Black out 100% very pleased with the product. Easy to put up and down too.,5
244,"Blackout blind was the cheapest I found, good quality, and arrived on a Sunday.. so very pleased arrived early.",5
245,Blacks out all light.  It's like having a portable blackhole without the drawbacks like immense gravitational pull and distortion of the space-time continuum.  It will fit most windows.  The strong suction caps actually work (patent must be pending) to hold it in place.  Velcro tabs allow it to be adjusted for length and height.,5
246,"Bloomin' brilliant.It's worth paying a bit more than you would for a run-of-the-mill unbranded Android device. The parental controls are fabulous, and linking content to my Prime account is so convenient.",5
247,"Blue and pink bought for granddaughter and grandson, great success!",5
248,"Bought 2 of these for my kids aged 5 and 8, my son complained that it was not fair as he wanted an Ipad.!!! Think they have been spoilt just a little.Well the following day he declared he loved it..We had broken so many Ipads in the past, that the fact this included a 2yr no quibble replacement policy I had to look into it..Ok the instructions are non existent and it took 24hrs to realise it had bluetooth and its also in an Amazon locked environment, but the kids control is just awesome and you can download from BBC Iplayer & Amazon movies for those long quiet journeys we like to have :-)Then consider its 20~30% the cost of an Ipad it deserves 5 stars..Shame Amazon does not have a Tech phone number to allow you to know all the things it really can do..I sense its better if you have Amazon prime although I have not worked out yet how to get the music app on the kids  profiles yet",5
249,Bought 2 of those for us and our daughter room. Impressed with results,5
250,"Bought a cheaper android tablet for £50 for my boy. It was useless! This is very responsive, the warranty seems brilliant and the apps are great",5
251,"Bought add a gift and were loved. Price was brilliant, looked great, perfect",5
252,Bought as a Christmas present for Grandson. He loves it,5
253,"Bought as a gift, and they really like it.  It's simple to use and that's perfect for their use.  Wish the adult controls were a little more, or that you could remotely control it, or share content down to the kids profiles easily.  But they're minor issues which i worked around.  However, for someone less technical that would prove frustrating.",5
254,"Bought as Christmas Present for my 5 1/2 year old, after reading mixed reviews on here. My boy as been playing on it since Christmas day with no problems so far, nice size, appears to be good quality, case is very robust and hardwearing, comes pre-loaded with lots and lots of apps, Amazon apps etc. Easy to download games, books etc for free. Registered it in my name, and so every time my boy switches it on he as to pass it to me so I can enter my password, a right pain, you can disable this my switching it to kids profile only but then there is no option to watch you tube, use the browser etc.",5
255,Bought blue for myself and this one as a gift. Hopefully she will love them as much as I love mine,5
256,Bought due to inconsiderate neighbours with a love of leaving their security lighting on which points directly into my house - this beauty did the trick .. stick well and defiantly no light pollution getting through this bad boy. I cut it in half to do two windows and its been great would definitely buy again,5
257,"Bought during Black Friday sales as a Christmas present for my eldest son. I really like the fact that the 2 year warrenty doesn't start until registered, so no loss of 2 months cover due to early purchase before Christmas.My son had been using an innotab, a tablet that claims to be for use up until around 12 years old. To be honest, I thin kit was reaching end of useful life over the last year as had outgrown the games, putting videos on it was a painful process for me, and the propriotry charger seemed to always get left at grandparents houses.I had been looking at buying an old iPad or android tablet, but had concerns about useage and content. I was wary of the Fire tablets being locked into the Amazon ecosystem, but so far seems to be completely unfounded. I got good feedback from family members who bought a regular fire tablet for their kids, so took the plunge during Black Friday sales. The Kids Unlimited seems to be great and more than enough for his entertainment needs.  He's in the lower age bracket as far as profiles go, so there is the option in future to open up more content as he gets older. The case also seems sturdy enough, and battery life is decent. The fact it's micro usb charging port is nice also as we don't need to carry special chargers around for his tablet.So far, so excellent. I'll try to update this review as we travel more with the tablet to assess offline functionality, and as I set up more parental controls (such as limiting useage during the school week).Highly recommend.",5
258,Bought for 4 year old daughter at Christmas. She absolutely loves it although I am not too impressed that not only she has managed to get in to my bed in a morning unnoticed I am woken to the sound of peppa pig on full blast in my ear from this tablet. Joking aside features are great. I looked around for this and it definitely exceeded my expectations.,5
259,"Bought for a friend (and her baby daughter!) and have been told only good things about it.Arrived on time, and seems to have been worth the money paid.",5
260,Bought for a friend who wears them all the time! They're very pretty & value for money :),5
261,Bought for granddaughters birthday. She was over the moon and has had hours of enjoyment from it.,5
262,Bought for my 2 year old at xmas she loves it especially the books you can dl for bedtime !!! Fab item,5
263,Bought for my 3yr old son this Christmas. Absolutely fantastic bit of kit! Intuitive operating system adapted for kids means my son knows exactly what to do within a few hours of first opening it!,5
264,"Bought for my 4yr old granddaughter ....... she can use it with ease+I can let her, knowing she can't stumble on anything inappropriate for her age. Wonderful + I can switch it over for my own use when she goes home.Brilliant buy.",5
265,Bought for my 5year and he’s not been off it yet!!,5
266,Bought for my 6 year old son who is extremely happy with it.,5
267,"Bought for my 6yr old sons birthday,  he loves it.  it is easy to use and very kid friendly. Parental controls and curfews are easy to set up and manage.  love it!",5
268,bought for my daughter for christmas but been setting it up for her ready is brilliant,5
269,"Bought for my daughter's 4th birthday she loves it, older brother jealous need to get another for him now.",5
270,Bought for my daughters 5th birthday. she loves it,5
271,Bought for my granddaughter at Christmas and she hasn’t put it down since,5
272,"Bought for my son's Xmas. Packed in after 3 weeks. Totally unresponsive. Amazon sending out a ""refurbished"" one tomorrow which will be going straight back on the same lorry. Either these products are faulty or Amazon  are sending out refurbished tablets described as ""new"". Avoid and beware!",5
273,Bought for presents and they loved them,5
274,Bought for someone else,5
275,Bought it for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it. You can set parental controls to prevent her buying games and downloading apps online. It is linked to my own fire as well,5
276,Bought one for everyone in the family. Sturdy and unobtrusive.,5
277,"Bought these to put up in a conservatory in Spain, didn't want the whole area closed off, but this keeps the sun off the TV excellently. Excellent for a youngsters room as well as the sun here tends to wake him up early otherwise. Excellent",5
278,"Bought this after hearing from colleagues how good it was for their children.  My son is only two and I was dubious about getting him a tablet so young, but this is fantastic.  Age suitable apps and games only, his speech has come on leaps and bounds and is absolutely brilliant for entertaining and educating at the same time.  I've recommended this to parents of other youngsters, we wouldn't be without it.",5
279,Bought this as a gift as my one worked so well. Really simple and easy to use and keeps the phone secure.,5
280,"Bought this as a present for my 5y/o from her grandfather. Really liking the controls on it regarding content which seems age appropriate so far. Also like the idea that we can set limits as to how long they can spend on it. Kids now realise that the parents can change this accordingly - good behaviour may allow them to gain another 15 mins of apps / reading / videos, where as being naughty loses 15 mins of one of the categories.",5
281,"bought this as my husband on nights.. works really good this time of the year,,,",5
282,Bought this back in July to take on holiday with us and to use at home! It's a brilliant portable product and will recommend to anyone. Very easy and very effective. Also use it partly accross the window during the day to darken out the bedroom and promote better daytime naps!! Worth every penny!! One sleeping sound baby and happy mummy!!,5
283,Bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it. Amazing tablet.,5
284,"Bought this for my 2yr old for hes birthday and am super happy with it, easy to set up and he loves it.was a shame about the delivery was meant to be here on hes birthday stayed in all day but wasn't delivered then to receive a text to say they tried to deliver but nobody home which was a lie, called customer service twice that day who assured me it will be delivered but it wasn't. driver lied as i pulled him up on it when i saw him the next day and said well we had a lot of delivery....Not my problem really annoyed me i spent the day in and another and on the phone with people fobbing me off..Tablet is great just a shame about the delivery and the lieing customer service ruined what should of been a special day.",5
285,"Bought this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it, great for kids",5
286,"Bought this for my grand-daughter, arrived promptly, the children love it. I let her mother set it up with the various controls, so I can’t comment on how easy it is to use, although it was given to a three year old who was already quite confident operating her cousin’s.",5
287,Bought this for my grandsons 5th birthday. He absolutely loves it. He downloads games and films etc with ease. He likes that he can use it in the car also. Well worth the money. He has dropped it a couple of times but no damage thanks to the casing.,5
288,Bought this for my grandsons Xmas. He's only three but has mastered it already.,5
289,"Bought this for my son after having one myself. They are really easy to use, good quality, works perfectly with an iPhone 6.Would definatly recommend.",5
290,Bought this for my son christmas best thing i ever bought he has used it daily and the content included massive it keeps him entertained in the car and at home,5
291,Bought this for my then 6 year old boy 2 Xmas's ago. He is still loving it says it is his best present ever. Doesn't read much but watches the kids show plays various apps. 100% safe when left on kids mode. Very handy when we are out and I can switch it to my account and get on the internet or look up something on my account 🤣 Can't go wrong with this,5
292,"Bought this for our 2.5 year old son thinking he'd grow into it but it would possibly keep him away from my phone. He took to it instantly, streams his own games and programs, can adjust the volume and switch it on himself. He LOVES it and I feel rest assured at how safe it is for him to play away happily without the worry of him accidentally purchasing things or seeing things he shouldn't. It's a perfect size for our change bag, light weight too so easy for me to add to bag or for him to carry. The protective case is great and bouncy. On top of all of that, the quality of the screen is spot on. I have my own secured section which I've used to read books on and set up a few apps. The battery lasts a while too, not timed it but I know I can take the tablet to entertain toddler whilst out and not worry about charging.I cannot find fault with this tablet. Even our baby is showing interest!!!",5
293,"Bought this for our caravan holiday, having been woken last year at 5.15 am with cries of ""it's too bright! Turn it off"" ( referring to the enormous nuclear reactor in the sky) which was counteracted the next day with a duvet and gaffer tape at the window - far from ideal.This year we installed the gro anywhere blackout blind in seconds and we're amazed how effective it was. Both boys slept through until their normal at-home wake-up time which resulted in a much more relaxing holiday for their mum and me. Can't recommend highly enough!",5
294,Bought this for our daughters room. Perfect. Does what it says on the tin!,5
295,Bought this for when my daughter visits with my grandson. She was very pleased. Keeps the light out really well and easy to put up.,5
296,Bought this for xmas present.My boy absolutely loved it.Past delivery and very good packaging.Highly recommended.,5
297,Bought this hoping that it would fit into the small vents on the top of the dashboard of my Audi A3. The main vents are circular. It appears to work!It was seeing my daughter's that prompted me to order despite her main vents being horizontal. Like the clip action to hold my iPhone 6S firmly in place.,5
298,Bought this on recommendation from my daughter who had purchased one to black-out her 10 month old son's (our grandson) bedroom during the summer.  Really simple to install and remove and grandson settled instantly on a recent visit to our house.  Far better than black-out curtain linings.  Thoroughly recommended for home or holidays.,5
299,Bought this so I could get some sleep on the sunny early mornings during summer. I have this up using the Velcro tabs and it stays put all night. Works excellently and a great price on Amazon,5
300,Bought this to cut out the morning sunlight to avoid broken sleep. We live in rented accommodation and so do not want to spend a small fortune on customised curtains/blackout blinds for somewhere that we will not be living permanently.The difference is undeniable as can be seen in the comparison photo. The only niggle is that the curtain is not quite long enough to cover the window but as this is a large bay window it's understandable.There is no light penetration at all through the curtain itself.Would recommend to everyone who is looking for an affordable solution to other blackout blinds which can be put up and taken down as desired.,5
301,Bought this with reduction as on special offer.  Was already paying for amazon for kids so worked out  as very good value. Massive improvement in quality to the Amazon Fire 7 which I already bought 2 of and which the kids broke quickly even with good quality cases. Reassured by amazon no quibble return with kids edition. Ironically this has already lasted 3 months and not been broken or damaged. The extra size and improved screen quality makes it worth buying. I often use it myself instead of my ipad as it is big enough to be very useful but much smaller than a full tablet.,5
302,Bought thise for my wife to use to start expressing before our baby arrived! Does a fantastic job and is really easy to clean!,5
303,bought to replace an old kindle which had sadly died. can't praise this highly enough - wee man loves it and uses the games and books before his bedtime. also discovered that the harry potter series of books are included in the kids so bedtime reading sorted for the next few weeks at least lol,5
304,Bought to replace my old series 7 shaver and after 3 shaves I can already see the improvement in the technology.,5
305,"Bought two of these and they're absolutely fantastic for young children, the package tailored to yr child's age is fantastic. I also love that they are a normal tablet too so adults can just use under their own profile n get their amazon prime etc",5
306,"Bought two of these for my 6 and 8 year old daughters they love it plenty of books games and it’s kid proof allows you to limit there use aswell,stops the worry of them getting content that’s not suitable would definitely recommend",5
307,Bought two of these for my boys to keep them away from our fragile phones.... work perfectly and feel indestructible... Very pleased.,5
308,Bought two of these for my grandkids. They play with them all the time.,5
309,"Bought two of these for visit from very young grandchildren. They arrived very quickly and were just as it said on the tin.It was easy to put up. I wasn't quite sure how they would adjust, but they have very natty bits of Velcro spaced along the edges, so it's very flexible. We even managed to fit them behind some vertical blinds.  I had no problems with them sticking, and they stayed up all night. Taking down was just as simple.Blackout was good. Happy parents and grandparents as children slept till 6.30 :)",5
310,Boughted form my 5 year old daughter she is very delight ... very easy to setup.. great quality thaks. Amazon,5
311,Braun quality top class,5
312,"Brauns top of the range shaver, comes with a nice solid leather case which will keep the shaver protected if traveling. The shaver itself performs as expected very well for an electric shaver. I cant see any electric shaver competing with a manual razor so to compare is pointless. As previously mentioned has 5 fixed positions or a floating position to give users flexibility. Has a fast charge function and you will need to charge it initially as it comes completely discharged. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was the shaver doesn't feel as solid or as well built as previous models, I think the chrome plated plastic makes it feel cheaper than it should be.Anyway the shaver comes with a Clean and Charge unit which looks to be exactly the same as previous Braun models, after comparing the cleaning cartridges I can confirm they are exactly the same as previous models, if you search Amazon for Braun CCR3 you will get the correct ones.Braun CCR3 Clean and Renew Electric Shaver Refill Cartridges - Pack of 3Don't worry if the documentation has not been updated with this new model they are the same. A lot of people are having trouble finding the cleaning cartridges for this reason. Not essential but it does clean the shaver well and gives it a lemon scent every time its used.",5

315,Brill product. Fiddly to start until you've had a few goes but once mastered really effective. Bought them for caravan holidays and touch wood had a few lie ins already!  Bought 2 when on offer and would highly recommend to others,5
316,Brill would love another for my other little boy but feel when it's full price it's a bit on the expensive side,5

318,Brilliant,5
319,Brilliant  its  was  a  gift  but  the  person love its.........,5

323,Brilliant black out blind. Easy to put up and move around for travel. Very happy with item,5
324,"Brilliant blind, easy to fit and adjust. The blind is huge and I was worried it would be too big for the window but the Velcro makes it easy to decrease the size of it by folding it to fit. Suckers work well. Highly recommended. The window I needed it for is less than a metre width and drop.",5
325,"Brilliant blind! Really happy with it, it makes the room totally dark. Helps my little girl sleep that extra bit longer on these lighter mornings! Would definatly recommend and buy again if needed.",5

335,Brilliant for my 5 year old,5
336,Brilliant gadget . I rarely bother to review purchases but this is outstanding. It holds my iPhone in a perfect position and I don't have to remove it from its case. I find Waze way better than either my built in GPS or plug in version. This lovely little phone holder also be to view it safely and achieves everything it promises,5
337,"Brilliant idea,If you need too sleep during the day,its excellent.Will be taking it away on Hols,as curtains are often too thin.Very pleased,would recommend.",5

356,Brilliant product great tablet had it 5 months now and seems impossible to break easy for my 4year old use. Shame there not more talking /audio books,5
357,"Brilliant product, bought one each for my boys, no arguments as they both look identical and both children can access their personal setting from either of the tablets.Lightweight even with the covers which are robust yet soft touch.The amazon kids package that was included is amazing.  So many different games and videos and cartoons, all age appropriate and changeable as they get older.  You can also add your own apps.My only issue is that I the tablet does not support the download of buy and keep purchases from sky - but does support sky go so they can stream.Also tablet doesn't support you tube kids (which would be a huge bonus for a 'kids edition' tablet), however it does support YouTube so I can set my settings on this.Overall, though a great product which I would highly recommend.  Might even treat my self to one....",5
358,"Brilliant product, have used for both of my kids to reduce early waking. We always take it on holiday with us and the suckers can be adjusted for different windows.  Has lasted well (3.5 years)",5
359,"Brilliant product! So easy to use, sturdy and does the job well. Very happy with my purchase.",5

364,"Brilliant shaver, very quiet and very effective",5
365,Brilliant so easy and safe my son has a great time with it I would totally recommend this product to everyone.,5
366,Brilliant tablet,5
367,Brilliant tablet for the kids. Easy to configure and put in the parental controls.,5
368,"Brilliant tablet for the little people i was so impressed i went and brought the fire hd10 for my self instead of an i pad , brilliant casing and already passed the 3 year child drop test !!!!",5
369,"Brilliant tablet, amazon Kids is brilliant!",5
370,Brilliant tablet. Very child friendly. Safe and secure from safety point of view as the can't access anything like Google or YouTube with out a pin code and switching it from child to normal mode. Case is very robust aswell.,5
371,"Brilliant this, does exactly what I wanted it to do. Doesn't obstruct the windscreen and holds my iPhone 6 with no problems. Came in handy now Pokemon Go is out, can spin them Pokestops while am driving to work.",5
372,"Brilliant to take away with you, the size is adaptable and does exactly what it says on the tin.",5
373,Brilliant value and really nice earrings. I don't get why people are complaining. If you read the description and looked at the size you'd have an idea of what to expect but no complaints this side. Definitely recommend :),5
374,Brilliant value with 'no worry 2 year warranty'. So easy to use and with parental control is ideal for young kids. My daughter loves hers.,5
375,"Brilliant, although doesn't stick to some windows, don't know why! Might be that the window needs to be exceptionally clean to get it to stick. It works really well in our nursery, really blocks out light. Didn't work when we stayed at relatives house.",5
376,"brilliant, does what it says and came quickly. Thank you.",5
377,"Brilliant, everything you need! My son loves it",5
378,"Brilliant, huge and does exactly what it's supposed to do.",5
379,"Brilliant, just what I needed.",5
380,"Brilliant, my 2 year old grandson very quickly learnt to use it.  Plenty of material and you can download more. Recommended.",5
381,"Brilliant, perfect for kids and great for adults too can’t really fault it.",5
382,"Brilliant, thank you. I am a nurse and often work night shifts, so this is perfect for me. It can be attached to the window when I want to sleep through the day and easily removed when I want to wake up naturally with the day.",5
383,"Brilliant, we have found so much to do with our two year old on this device to supplement his real world learning. One issue to look out for is the screen going black and freezing for no apparent reason, it's a common issue from what we've seen and only requires the battery to be disconnected for a few seconds to sort out (don't do this if it's under warranty of course but call Amazon).",5
384,"brilliant, well worth the price and portable, perfect",5
385,Brilliant!  Have recommended to others & they are happy with these blinds too. Not suitable for permanent feature as taking them down and putting them up again on a regular basis could be tiresome and damage the 'suckers'.  I use mine when I have visitors.,5
386,Brilliant! Loving the parental controls - can still access YouTube but you have to approve the videos. Lots of well known character games as well as educational. Battery lasts well.,5
387,"Brilliant! Permanent in nursery, makes naps and bedtime much easier. Plan to take it on holiday, great as it will fit most windows.",5
388,Brilliant!!! Just make sure to wet the sucker things when you put the blind up or you will find it had fallen down by morning. My baby's room is nice and dark and he sleeps through until a decent hour,5
389,"BRILLIANT!!!! My 3 year old loves it as do I, a great buy would highly recommend to anyone with a toddler. You are both able to have an account which means you can download YouTube etc on your account knowing that your child's account is still safe",5
390,Brilliant.  Keeps grandson happy for ages,5
391,Brilliant. Be careful if you use your phone with battery case as it's jaws only just grab my phone. Which means if you drive erratically or like a moron the phone can occasionally slip out. But only if you use a fat battery case.,5
392,Brilliant. Couldn't be happier. It sits perfectly in my car and doesn't fall off. Used it for long and short trips.,5
393,"Brilliant. I like  how you can have various sizes, since I dont like the dark it enables me to put it up in the main part of my window leaving the top clear. Having an east facing winfow i was getting woken up at around 4:30am every morning, since i installed this, and still leaving the top clear, it enables me to have a through nights sleep. Highly Reccomended to anyone who is been kept awake dye to light.",5
394,"Brilliant. Kids love it. Easily expandable memory gives it great longevity. High spec device, that I think is better than my three year old Fire HDX tablet.",5
395,"Brilliant. Love how as a parent, I can control exactly what my kids do on them.You can set age restriction and  time restrictions.",5
396,"Brilliant. So effective and easy to use, we use it daily at home. wish we'd bought one earlier.",5
397,Brilliant.. adult has a profile. Kids have a separate one. Kids need to know pin to access the adult one. Lots of apps to download.  Things like YouTube adult can download on to their profile and if needed adult can add apps like this to kids profile.  It's really really simple.  When were in the car alot off the apps do work. Ok things roblox won't but kids can still use the tablet to play without wifi. Love the protective cover on them. Battery life is great so far. I bought 2 of them and will recommend these to family and friends. I love how I can control what my kids can view and even put a timer on them so they can only have them for a certain amount of time. Excellent,5
398,"Brought as an Xmas present for my 6 year old, excellent purchase, easy to set up and she loves it!",5
399,Brought for a4 year old easy for him to use and very entertaining,5
400,Brought for my son. I haven't got a clue how to use it but he does. At 3 he went from an ipad to this. Uses it really well,5
401,"Brought this for my daughters bedroom, the sucker pads just stick to the window and are easy to remove if you want to take it on holiday etc. The only disadvantage I've found for using it in a bedroom is unless you remove the blind from the window every morning and put it back up again at night (which I imagaine would get quite annoying) no sunlight gets into the room. For us this isn't a problem as she naps during the day still and I also knew this would be the case when I brought it.",5
402,"Brought this for my toddler, really good quality keeps the room dark and cool, the suction pads and Valero make it very easy to use.",5
403,"Brought this for our 5 year old boy, he loves it! easy to set up & use.When he goes to bed i can use it as a kindle as you can switch to adult profile",5
404,Brought this for our 5 year old son. It's brilliant! We decided on it as it has a good protector already and it comes loaded with Kids Fire so our son can use it himself and pick his own games and puzzles. We've used the time restrictions so he only gets to play on it for up to 2 hours a day although it's rare that he does anyway. He does really enjoy using it and I am sure it will get a lot of use over the years.,5
405,"By far one of the best phone holders i have used! Well made, high quality product!",5
406,By far the best Christmas presents my 9 and 4 year olds received,5
407,"Came very quickly, does exactly what it's supposed to do. Very happy",5
408,"Can not survive with out this,  it's that simple",5
409,Can;t wait to wear them.  Have to wait six weeks so my piercing is ok.,5
410,"Can't recommend these enough.We bought the kids an iPad Pro at first and I soon realised it wasn't a good idea for them to have such an expensive tablet as it wasn't being looked after and only used for YouTube and games. Also it was getting expensive to download things via app store.So we decided to give one of these a go instead and best thing we ever did. Much much better for kids. With the amazonkidsunlimited included too it means they can download as many games, books and videos that they want all for free. The parental controls are fantastic too and it also seems like the material is a lot more educational then that of the iPad.Would give more than 5* if I could!",5
411,"Can’t comment on durability yet as only used it a few times for grandson visits, but it is really easy to fit, it’s quite large for our windows but is adaptable!  It has served its ourpose really well the times we have used it. Really useful purchase.",5
412,Can’t fault this item my daughter loves it,5
413,Cannot give a review yet as this is a Christmas present for grandson. Will submit one later in year. Needed to buy now while on offer as I needed a blue one.,5
414,"Charming earrings, sparkle particularly well and are a good size",5
415,"Cheap price for good quality, happy with it",5
416,"Childproof protection case, loads of fun and easy to master apps (even for our 3 year old daughter), good parental control, free years subscription to Amazon Kids make this a superb value tablet",5
417,Children are really enjoying the tablet,5
418,"Clips on effortlessly, really firm and adjusts to hold a wide range of phones. Previously tried a bunch of suckers (literally) that are programmed to fall off when you need them most.",5
419,"Clips to air vent securely, and phone is easy to mount and easy to remove, perfect and the price is excellent",5
420,Compact and really does block out all the light,5
421,Compact well made and easily as good if not better than the considerably more expensive Belkin version available online & in the apple shop.,5
422,"Considerate drivers should always have a phone holder for the passenger and this is about a simple and discreet as you can get, fits onto a vent and simplicity to use.",5
423,Cool thanks,5
424,"Could do without this anymore. It's perfect, no light comes through at all. Suckers are a little difficult to stick, so I use a baby wipe to wet all round the window then they stick perfect.",5
425,Couldn't be without it now. One of the suckers came off and I can't get it back on but it doesn't really affect it's use. I just leave them up all the time so her room is always ready for nap time. Downside is when her windows steam up mould starts to appear due to lack of ventilation. Just have to remember to take them down and clean the windows once in a while!,5
426,Couldn't live without these. I ended up buying another two to cover two windows for the late summer season,5
427,Covers my windows and blacks out the light. No problems getting this on and it has stayed stuck on. Overall simple and does it job very well. Apply it properly and it will block out enough to keep kids sleeping.,5
428,daughter loves it free kids pack is great too,5
429,Decent!,5
430,Definitely keeps light out. Only wish is if it was easier to cut up.,5
431,Definitely recommend this one. It's really easy to use. Worked wonders for making our daughters room dark and giving us the extra few hours of much needed sleep.,5
432,"Defo helped darken my daughters room. Would recommended, may buy some for  my room",5
433,"Deliberated over this purchase for some time, read lots of reviews.Excellent product, brought for 4 year old grandson.  Lots of games that help with numbers, letters, reading and co-ordination.  Two family members have purchased the fire HD following my recommendation. Peace of mind that your child cannot access harmful material.",5
434,Delighted,5
435,Delighted with the blind. My son works night shift and this really blocks out the light.,5
436,"Delighted with these earrings , they match the necklace I also bought",5
437,"Delighted, arrived within 2days and they are very pretty excellent quality for price and very comfortable to wear. Now ordered pendant to match",5
438,Delightful.,5
439,Delivered on time and this is a great product. We travel a lot and this comes with us everywhere so that our toddler can sleep.,5
440,Delivered quickly. Good quality and works just fine.,5
441,Delivered super fast. Does what it says. Sticks on very strong.,5

443,Did exactly what it said on the tin.  Great item,5
444,Did just the job we needed and the fact we can take it anywhere is perfect.,5
445,Discreet and fits much better than others I've tried.,5
446,Do whatsapp is supposed to do.,5
447,"Do you know when you find something that completely changes your life? Yes, i know it sounds too much, but it completely changed mine.I've always been a wet-shaver and always treated it like some sort of ceremony that lasted forever. It always required a lot of preparation and time to get a smooth skin and sharp shave. Which of-course it made me hate shaving.I completely hated shaving, it used to take too much time and effort. I always thought electric shavers couldn't give a clean/close shave but that was before I tried the Braun Series 9, it completely changed how I behave regarding my beard.The Braun shaver works perfectly and it's very fast! If I am running late for work I just have to run it through my face and in a minute there is no sign of hair. Anywhere.The battery lasts forever, I have been using it 4 times per week for the last 3 weeks with only 1 charge and the display still shows 1 line in the digital display, i guess around 25% and it will go for more than a month in a full charge. Like most electric shavers it doesn't use the standard UK 3 pins so you better have an adapter.The Design design is very robust with a nice weight, it feels very confident and with a tight grip in your hands. It feels like a premium product and judging from Braun's history, I guess it will last forever.  The removable head is not the easiest to clean, but I think that is expected for such a complicated set of blades.I don't like facial hair, so I would totally recommend it for someone who wants a clean and close shave.I can definitely say I won't be going back to a wet shave ever again. I received the product for free from Braun.",5
448,Does a fine job at holding my phone while I drive,5
449,Does a great job and you can change the size with the velcro bits. You have to rub the suckers on the window a bit sometimes so it sticks well but it definitely holds well and makes the room nice and dark.,5
450,Does a great job of blacking out my sons room throughout the summer light evenings,5
451,Does a great job of keeping out light.,5
452,Does as it is supposed to. Makes the room very dark. It was easy to fit & as yet it has stuck to the window without any problems.,5
453,"Does as the label says - blacks out daylight in the bedroom. I used this all of last summer, and I kept the blind fitted to my baby's window during the summer months....it certainly kept out the light and will be using it again this year.",5
454,Does everything it says it does.  Only gripe is that the screen isn't as responsive as an ipad.,5
455,"Does exactly as described! Blocks out the light, sticks to the window, can be easily removed. A lifesaver when it starts to get light at 4am where we are and our children like to get up with the light!",5
456,Does exactly as it's described. Successfully secures my iPhone 6 whilst on long journeys. Doesn't seem to become dislodged even when driving on bumpy ground,5
457,Does exactly what I bought it to do. Sits neatly on my air vent (Audi Q3). Phone is snug in the arms. Extension mechanism very smooth and angle from driving position is good.,5
458,"Does exactly what I need, holds my Sony no problem.",5
459,Does exactly what is required and is flexible in size.  The packaway size is very convenient for travelling.,5
460,Does exactly what is says on the tin 😀,5
461,Does exactly what it is supposed to do.,5
462,Does exactly what it says - blocks the sun perfectly. Suckers work great (I was worried about this after reading reviews) - overall a great product.,5
463,Does exactly what it says blackout blind. I was a tad unsure whether this would fully block out the sun as my babies room is south/west facing and has the sun in there room all day but the first night i put this up they went straight to sleep!,5
464,Does exactly what it says it does,5
465,Does exactly what it says on the tin,5

488,Does what it says on the tin,5
489,Does what it says on the tin. Great design. Fab price. Arrived quickly. Thanks,5
490,Does what it says on the tin. Lots of poppers to easily conform to smaller windows. Some light still gets around the sides but this has already made sleeping much more pleasant in a number of bedrooms recently.,5

498,Don't know how I'd of coped the light nights without this. Fabulous and really dark,5
499,"Don't know why there's so many complaints, they're a lovely size and look great. Great Christmas present!",5
500,"Due to the sun streaming in the white blinds in son's bedroom,  bought this product through a recommendation, delighted with the product very easy to put up. Like how you can make it smaller by using the Velcro. Slight smell of plastic first few times of using but soon wears off. Will be buying again for my bedroom too ! Great idea wish I'd known of such a product years ago !",5
501,Early days yet but it seems to be a hit with my 4 year old grandson. Good robust case +I've fitted a screen protector which help should help protect it.,5
502,Earrings are pretty. Very good price.,5
503,"Easily fit on to our air vent (Toyota Auris), holds the phone firmly, very easy to use.",5
504,Easy to adapt to any window and does the job extremely well. Highly recommend,5
505,"Easy to apply and it works! I have been really struggling with getting my baby to nap for longer in her cot during the day. I think this has actually helped! We had a ""blackout"" blind from Argos in there before but it wasn't actually keeping the room dark during daylight. This definitely does!",5

511,Easy to put up and take down. Can adjust to most window sizes and can be taken anywhere in the handy carrier bag. A must have for the summer weather.,5
512,"Easy to set up and control from your smart phone. It’s easy to change limits of use allowance and is split into weekdays and weekends. I also changed it mid play and device then shows a message of ‘you are all done for today’, your child just thinks they have been on for all their allowance that day. I would say it’s the safest one on the market for kids use.",5
513,"Easy to set up, easy to use. Although takes a bit of getting used to in comparison to the iPad. My daughter loves it though.",5
514,"Easy to set-up and perfect for my 5 year old daughter, she loves it!",5

So simple to use, the parental controls cater for any and all concerns you might have when putting a table in the hands of a child.

Wouldn't mind one in my bedroom! It can be difficukt to pack it up small enough to fit back into its carry case however but the fact it has a carry case is a nice touch.

636,"Excellent wee tablet, perfect for the kids, will last a couple of years at least, lots to do for them and works well for the adults to. Bargain.",5
637,"Excellent wet and dry shaver from Braun, as you would expect from the price. This shaver gives a really comfortable and close shave. It is easy to hold in the hand, very quiet, and feels an excellent quality item. You can use it in the bath, the shower, and with it's five metre waterproofing, even underwater if you are so inclined. Needless to say then, it is washable after use, either under the tap, or fully immersed. One of the biggest benefits is the high capacity lithium ion battery, which charges to full capacity in around  an hour, and lasts me for at least 10 shaves. There is a handy LED battery display too, so you know exactly how much charge is left. I'm not sure how the ""sonic"" assisted blade system works, but it has completely altered the way I shave. Instead of having to revisit areas where hairs have been missed, this shaver manages to catch and cut them on the first pass. The built in trimmer works well on sideburns, and I'm sure it would work equally well on beards and moustaches, if I had these. The shaver comes with a travel pouch, mains adapter, a brush for cleaning, and a small bottle of oil for lubricating the blades. It can be used dry, although I found it worked best for me using shaving gel. The whole package comes with a 2 year warranty. Is it worth the money? Well, in my opinion yes. I normally use rotary head shavers because I find them quicker and more comfortable. However, the Braun 9040s has changed my mind. It is every bit as good as a top of the range rotary shaver, and no more expensive. It gets a big thumbs up from me.  Highly recommended!",5

665,"Fab breast pump.  I have used this product alongside another brand of breast pump and believe this is the better of the two.  It is very effective at getting more milk from the breast because of the letdown phase and the differing strengths of suction that you can use.  It is easy to clean and sterilize ready for the next use.  This product can be plugged into the mains. The bottle that comes along with this product is also very good - my 9 week old daughter took to it immediately, again after struggling with another brand.  The teat is sturdy and effectively mimics the action of the breast.",5
666,Fab couldn't recommend enough! one of the first things I bought when pregnant the 2nd time around as we use the blind every night and have even taken it away on holiday.,5
667,"Fab fab fab! Before I bought this I had a roller blind, a blackout blind and blackout curtains up at my childs window.A friend recommnded these and so I bought one (even though the husband was telling my not to waste my money) - It has been fab!It blocks out the light really well without leaving gaps for the light to come in. really important when you have a little one - as soon as its light they want to get up and refuse to sleep when its light in the summer! I take mine on holidays as well and its lasted me about 3 years so far! Buy one!",5
668,"Fab fab product.  The first time I had to use it, took 5 minutes to get up.  I wouldn't bother taking it down every day, but it serves it's purpose fantastically...infact, better than a blackout blind because of the snug fit",5
669,Fab for blocking out the light. Only downside is sometimes the suckers come loose and can be tricky to stick back up.Otherwise it's worked a treat for my little boy.,5

739,"Fantastic!! Love this!! Bought for covering windows during the day while back from night shift. Completely blacks room out. Good quality, comes with suckers attached for window.",5
740,fantastic.,5
741,"Fantastic. Comes in a lovely pink shockproof casing. You make an adult profile which has all the usual stuff , silk browser , calender , calculator, app store etc and then you add on child accounts. The adult part has a password/pin so the child cannot use that part or change any settings as it will ask for the password. You can set timers for how long they can use it and what time of day they can start using and what time they cannot use it past for instance my daughter's one will switch off at her bedtime. You can also choose to set it so they have to do a certain amount of reading or educational activity before they can use games etc. On the child's profile they have books, games and programmes. They do not have a web browser. Child can also take photos on there profile. I was able to add Minecraft buy purchasing on the app store in the adult profile and then going into setting and giving permission for it to be used on the child's game profile. It doesn't have the YouTube app although I've read it can be put on there by downloading certain things however YouTube can be found on the silk browser on the adult section so if my daughter wants to use it I let her into the adult part keep it on restricted mode and keep an eye on her whilst she uses it. However there is so much content on the child profile my daughter rarely asks to use YouTube anymore. It charges quickly and is pretty easy to use. It even waits to update in till you're not using it generally when it's idle and on charge. It was very simple to set up, seemed quite slow when I first turned it on but seems fine now. Extremely happy",5
742,fantastic. Great grip. great design. fits into the vents of a 2004 Saab 9-5 perfectly,5

750,First class service thankyoup,5
751,"First what comes in the pack apart from the shaver and manual? It comes with adaptor but you do have to buy a separate UK adaptor which you can buy from any pound shop. The kit includes a nice case for the shaver but does not include space for adaptor and oil/brush which is also included.As for the effectiveness of the shaver with 5 built in cutting heads you only need to run over a light beard once not several times to get a close shave its that good and you can use foam or gel before shaving, you can run it under a running tap to clean or just use the brush. So far the best shaver I've used yet.",5
752,"Firstly no matter what, a wet shave, even with a cheapo disposable razor leaves you feeling cleaner, smoother and better than an electric one - even this high end one from Braun. As far as I'm concerned the best shave you can get is with a traditional single bladed 'safety' razor. I have a quick and heavy beard growth so I need something good to deal with it or I end up looking like a unkempt old bloke pretty quickly.But - it takes a bit of care and time to avoid looking like a victim of a knife attack if you do go down the old school safety razor route. Next best thing is the modern multi-bladed wet razors that cost a bomb in disposable blades. They are pretty much bullet proof though. No pain, no blood and ultra good finish.And then the electric razor. I can't deny that getting this to review via Vine is a bit of a bonus for me and one that I've put to some use since getting it and in all fairness it's good. I do have a cheap electric razor which I leave in my bag I take to work and the gym and without a doubt this Braun razor is much, much better than my £50 one. Firstly it looks good - a bit retro and clearly premium. It feels high quality in one's hand and has just the right amount of weight to go some way to justifying the price. Build quality is top class and probably as good as it gets in electric razor terms with a sleek finish, cool display and tactile buttons.Now, as I said I prefer a wet shave and I do have a heavy stubble so I figure I'm a pretty good test for an electric jobbie. The reason I do have one and now this is for when I don't have the time or space for a proper shave. Usually after a gym session I'll just have a quick once over to keep things in check and the electric razor is perfect for that. This Braun does an admirable job of giving me a smooth face. Certainly my wife appreciates the continued clean shaven look rather than the three day Willie Nelson vision that I end up looking like if I don't make the effort. It cuts cleanly and I don't have to go over the same area too many times to ensure a decent finish. It also seems to allow a close shave in less accessible areas such as under my nose. There's a trimmer bit for the sideburns as well which also works well. Overall I doubt there is any other electric shaver that could do any better.Cleaning is easy as the head comes off for washing through and brushing out.There is also the integrated charging and cleaning base that sterilizes the shaver when needed. You fit a disposable reservoir in the base of the unit and it flushes through the head. Adds to the premium feel. Not sure if you would be able to take it on a plane though if you are travelling as it clearly states that it is flammable.Charging takes about 50 minutes using either 220v or 110v.Overall for me personally this is a great quick helper in between wet shaving.",5
753,"Firstly theirs not much to say about this product because its simply ""what it says on the tin""The Mpow E clip Air vent one step mounting car  phone holder is great , the fact that its just so simple is Great , no hassle no full , no sticking ,screwing or glueing just a simple push and the E clip is secure. I have tested this with Iphone 5 , Samsung galaxy s4 and a Motorola G and I can honestly say The fit for each phone was perfect. because the grips are extendible {simply pull and release around phone)  the phones where griped tight and snug , even over rougher ground the phone nor the clip did not budge. A very simple but sturdy and well made design and product 10/10 and would highly recommend for the price",5

755,"Firstly, a confession. I didn't start using electric shavers until about 8 years ago when I tried out a Braun Series 3 and immediately became a convert and am now a bit of a Braun fanboy. Over the last few years I've tried out the Series 3 and 5 and now the 9 and been very happy with all of them. You can use the 9 in the shower with a foam or gel or even in the bath as it's completely waterproof. I'ved tried it in both and got a great shave as usual, also tried it dry and again got a great smooth shave. It needs charging before you first use it but that takes about an hour and and once charged you get about 2 hours life before needing to recharge. It feels very comfortable in the hand and looks really smart and is in my opinion a really nice design. Overall, I can't fault it.",5
756,Fit anywhere!,5
757,"Fit for purpose and works well, good price too.",5
758,Fits firm and secure. Even with ohine still inside wallet. So good I nought one for each car,5
759,Fits good on the dasboard and wide enough to fit my galaxy s7,5
760,fits most vents and larger phones well,5
761,Fits my Astra 62 plate perfect,5
762,"Fits my iPhone 6+ nicely, feels secure & stable",5
763,"Fits ok, but does keep room dark if you take time to ensure you cover all gaps",5
764,Fits on my girl's bedroom window and helps her to sleep better in the summer mornings.,5
765,Fits our window perfectly and shuts out the direct sunlight. Very happy with this product.,5
766,"Fits perfect to most windows, great for the nursery.",5
767,"Fits perfect, great size not blocking anything else",5
768,fits perfectly into Toyota prius vent.love the fact that this phone holder extends from both sides and rotates around too.,5
769,"Fits very well- surprised at how big the coverage is, great design at also working on a smaller area. Came into its own for daily useage as temporary curtains for the nursery when we moved home!",5
770,Fits well in my wife's Mazda 3. Easy to use in and install.,5
771,Fits well just what I needed,5
772,"Fits well, good quality, looks pretty",5
773,"For a quick fix or for a temporary black out solution this is a great product.It has suction pads so was very easy to attached, no tools needed and also easy to remove to let more light in.My daughter has slept for longer in the mornings since we have had this.",5
774,For my youngest. She loves it! Easy to control content so she can only view age appropriate content. She loves it!! I asked her and she gave thumbs up and said good!!,5
775,For someone who works nights and sleeps in the day its great.  Blacks out everything and get a better nights sleep.,5
776,"For the price of these while on offer I cant believe how good they are. 5 year daughter has been using my iPad, not looked at it since having this. Content can be downloaded for the car , I do recommend a sd card to help with the longer journeys. Like the fact you can use as a tablet in parent mode and link your prime account to download moves etc. I have added YouTube to make a good alrounder. Age appropriate content is one of the best features. It is slightly slow at times but not enough to displease an inpatient child.",5
777,"For years I was a Philips electric shaver devotee, but my last shaver was a Remington and I was converted. Now, call me fickle, I’m a Braun fan for sure.I’m reviewing the 9095CC model- I’ll just mention that in case Amazon lumps this review in with different models as well. The 9090CC is identical except that the 9095CC is also OK to use in the wet, it seems.I do have a couple of very minor quibbles with the shaver, but I’m still going to give it 5 stars for one overriding and important reason- it shaves brilliantly. The results are incredibly quick, a single swipe of the mammoth shave head will take out most of the hairs in the first go and then just a bit of swiping back and forth and it’ll be job done.You get about the same amount of smoothness as I got from my previous Remington shaver, except that the Remington is quite a brutal little machine that makes you feel like you’re sandpapering your face, whereas this Braun is staggeringly painless and easy, and much quicker.It is a beast of a shaver- by far the biggest electric shaver I’ve ever used. By contrast, the pop-up trimmer bit at the back is quite narrow, but still effective.If the battery indicator on the shaver had been red instead of blue, I think the makers of Battlestar Galactica would probably have sued Braun for making something that looks like a Cylon- the combination of mostly gleaming chrome with some black edging and some small but bright neon-style lights is a very serious and science-fiction-looking thing. Mind you, when you’ve paid as much for your shaver as some people would pay for a second hand car, the fact it’s big and futuristic-looking is a plus.The slider which controls whether the shave head is fixed or free-roaming is where I’d expect the on-off button to be. That took a bit of getting used to, as I would finish the shave, flick that switch and wonder why it hadn’t turned off. Once you realise what the switch is for, it’s actually rather handy- the free-roaming head option works best for most of the face, but switching it to a fixed head position gives better results in the awkward bits like right underneath the nose.The 9095CC is one of few models that comes with a cleaning base station, which is a very unusual bit of kit. Firstly it’s huge; you don’t appreciate how huge it is until you look for somewhere to put it. If you thought the shaver itself was big (and it is), the cleaning base makes it look tiny.The wash cycle of the base station is surprisingly loud- it sounds like a happy old dot matrix printer. If your cleaning station’s in your bedroom and your wife’s gone to sleep already, press the ‘Start’ button if you want to wake her up.The base station uses a plastic cartridge filled with alcohol, and it’s recommended that you replace it every 8 weeks. I’m sure Braun would happily sell you replacement cartridges for some quite extravagant sum of money (at time of writing I couldn’t find an Amazon listing for replacement cartridges), but essentially all the cartridge is is a specially-shaped plastic tray with some scented denatured alcohol (a.k.a. methylated spirit) in it- so it would be very easy to refill this yourself without any real trouble. Meths is cheap in supermarkets and DIY stores and the cartridge has a big hole in the top. In fact you could probably use cheap vodka if you wanted. I’m sure the manufacturers would warn against this, naturally.So, all things considered, this is a serious and hefty bit of kit. It will take up a lot of space, it might take a tiny bit of getting used to, but ultimately it is a fantastic shave- quick, effective, painless, easy.",5
778,"Found this blind very useful, and  have later cut it up to use for a smaller window, too.",5
779,Found this table brilliant for my daughter.  Easy to use and robust,5
780,Fully met all the hopes and expectations of my 6 year old granddaughter. She loves it!,5
781,"Generally good but better if the children login would be an option from start thought it included Disney Life from the description, disappointed it didn't",5
782,"Genius invention, especially because you can fold it to the size you need. We take it everywhere with us on holiday. It is easy to fold up and pack in your suitcase. The extra sleep we get because we can keep our little ones room dark wherever we go is priceless.",5
783,give that wee bit sparkle,5
784,"Gives a good, close, clean shave. Only tried it dry so far, Does the job.  Cleaning unit works well.  Unit holds its charge well.",5

789,Good blackout blind which works helps our baby to sleep easier. Sometimes the sucker pads fall down but mostly work fine.,5
790,"good blind, portable, big enough for most windows. (but not huge bow widows) good suction never falls off etc. as it turns out LO sleeps fine without blackout, but this one is great if dont want to fit one in a room, or for changing rooms etc etc",5

799,good if you want to block out daylight during summer months.,5
800,Good item worth the money,5
801,Good job,5
802,"Good kids tablet for the price.I wish amazon would add remote access to the kids profile to edit the goals and daily timings from your own (non amazon)  device using amazon app or something.Some fearures in kids mode are too restrictive if you have an older child, like apps access to camera, web or alexa. But otherwise not bad. If your child is already usibg a lot of social media or messaging, it might be easier to set an adult profile with parental controls on, rather then kids mode.With some persuation you can get even non amazon apps on it in adult and kids profiles, which makes it almost unbeatable on content and price in kids tablet market. Five stars all round.There are some caviats, like many android based tablets it will get very slow after a while, but factory resetting it usually clears some of it. So don't expect much in terms of performance, but it is not as bad as Fire 7 we have, which is painfully slow.",5
803,Good Kindle. I bought two a yellow 8 inch for 4-year-old grandson and a blue 7 inch for his 3-year-old  younger brother. I love the free 12 months fire for kids. I set them up with time limitations and they are only allowed to use them when they visit. But as their parents work and I am retired I do a LOT of babysitting and these have certainly made my life easier. I love the educational games for counting and spelling. And the younger one loves his dinosaurs.,5
804,"Good large size. Thick and really does block out light. Suction is good, have had mine up for weeks and it hasn’t fallen down.",5
805,Good one,5
806,"Good phone holder. Holds my Samsung Galaxy S8+ no problem.I had a magnetic one previously and forgot to remove it when i sold the car doh! That one was brilliant as was adjustable on a ball joint.  If this had the same ball joint it would be perfect.Thought the metal plate would interfer with wireless charging if put in the phone case so went with this ""holder"" version.Being a bloke i chucked the booklet before using and it took a couple of minutes to realise the head of this holded rotates round 360 degrees clicking into position at regular intervals.When your phone is larger and heavier it pulls the air vent blades down so the phone can't be put at the exact angle you want vertically.  Not a problem but if i could set the position using a ball joint i would say this holder was the perfect holder.As it is a good 8/10 though.",5
807,good piece of kit - simple but effective,5
808,Good price for a good piece of kit.,5
809,"good price; bought as a present, the recipient was very pleased with it.",5
810,"Good price. Very easy for my 6 year old's to use, and they love it. Good range of ready loaded content and still to explore what is available to download. Easy password protection. I certainly recommend it for children of this age group, but take care it doesn't take over their lives!",5
811,"Good product although we wanted something more permanent and that can easily be opened and closed each day, so we instead went for a shower rail that doesn't need screwing in place (telescopic) and a black shower curtain! Nice product though for traveling with perhaps.",5
812,good product from a good seller,5
813,Good product has to wet the suction cups to make a really good bond no issues with the product and would recommend this to freinds,5

823,Good quality,5
824,Good quality and easy to use.,5
825,Good quality and robust cover,5
826,"Good quality and user friendly. A safe item for our 5 year old to play with without the worry of him accessing things he shouldn't. I have an Amazon Fire 10"" HD tablet which is fantastic so this one was registered as my second device and then you are able to switch users to allow certain apps if suitable. So for example our son wanted Minecraft so I bought it for my device and then allowed him to use it on his profile by giving permission from my profile. It is very easy to switch users to enable you to do this. By the way instead of paying £4.99 for Minecraft I paid with 500 Amazon coins which cost £4.",5
827,Good quality and very effective blackout blind. A bit awkward to put up and despite my best efforts there are odd cracks of light around the edges (although I am getting better with practice) but once the curtains are drawn the room is pitch black. Great for the night shift worker who doesn't like eye masks.,5

855,Gorgeous petite earrings. Bought these for valentines day for my daughters and they were worth every penny. A really good price.,5
856,"Got bought this for a Christmas prezzie after my old 7 series started playing up. After using many different brands over the years braun has been my favourite. My old 7 series was great, but this is even better. It's amazingly close, almost as close as a wet shave but without the irritation and razor burn. Out the box it cut close and smooth. It's expensive yes but you get what you pay for, a £20 razor could never come close. OK so it's plastic not metal but it still looks smart. It says you can't use it with foam or gel even though it's wet & dry, I used it with some shave gel and the shave was so close, it just says that foam or gel can clog the cleaning system but a good rinse after using washes away all the reminence of foam, ready for cleaning in the station. Love it...",5
857,Got for my 2 year old and its great with games and programmes for her age group - I can also have an account so we will be sharing! Easy set up. Very pleased.,5
858,Got for my 5 year old...best thing I ever purchased for her. It is a great learning tool as well as great for distracting the kids on long journeys. Glad we chose this tablet over other ones available on the market,5

862,Got this as a present to my husband and he loved it. Said the best shaving machine he ever used so far ..!,5
863,Got this for my 3 year old son and it is perfect. I believe it is good valve for the quality of the product. Great how the apps are locked down to his level and he is unable to access any pay for apps. You can choose if internet is available or not. On top of that if he breaks it within 2 year they will replace it.Shame they don't replace my now broken galaxy pad :),5
864,Got this in red and white too match my car love it really useful ....just can't use CD player thou,5
865,Got two of these one for 5 yr old and one for 8yr old. They both love them and can work them with ease. The parental controls are easy to set up and the fire for kids unlimited is really excellent and gives me peace of mind that they are not accessing sites/games etc that are suitable for them.,5

906,Great blinds for living in an urban area. Easy to use travelling too.,5
907,Great blnd does exactly as described which is what I needed for my 13 month old granddaugter when she stays with me.  One drawback is one of the suckers which happens to be the top right hand corner does not stick however this is not a MAJOR problem as it blocks out the majority of light and I have bought sticky back velcro to try out.,5
908,great buy,5
909,"Great buy for a new flat I moved into...definitely recommend it to those light sleepers out there especially in the summer days! Easy to use, sticks to windows perfectly and you can adjust the size by the velcro.Perfect buy for someone who needed to catch up on some serious sleep in the summer days!",5

911,"great buy, has kept my 5 year old niece amused for hours",5
912,"Great buy! Brilliant for travel, or, like us, baby's bedroom in-between moves! Applied properly, they completely block out the light. I think our blind is big enough to cover most windows, we had plenty of material to spare. Our baby slept through the first night (previously would wake at 5am when the sun came up), now we get to sleep till at least 7am!",5
913,"Great buy. Bought for when grand daughter visits. She is 2 and a half, and like a dark bedroom. Easy to put up and is completely light proof",5
914,Great car vent holder which is sturdy.The product was delivered swiftly as per the prime standards and comes very well packed and protected.The installation of this holder is very easy. Just slide it into any vent of your car where you feel comfortable looking at your phone and off you go. The phone snaps in as the wings of the stand widens and upon releasing locks your phone securely and perfectly. The sliding wings are very sturdy and does not look as if they will loosen up in the near future.Overall a Fabulous product at a very reasonable price!Go for it!,5
915,Great case . Little one is 2 and throws it about with no concerns of it breaking . Very happy with product .,5

926,"Great for breastfeeding mums who wish to express their milk. Very easy to use, quick results and the 2 levels are brilliant for maximising the amount of milk taken.  It is a bit noisy but that's expected of any pump. My baby really takes to the bottle well...overall, excellent value for money.",5

996,Great product not bulky and keeps the inside of car looking slick. Easy to get in and out it some say it's not that smooth but once you do a few times it's easy to get in and out it's not rocket science and it's cheap so you could always buy another if broke but it feels pretty strong,5

But for blocking out the day light whilst trying to game it's amazing!! Wet the suckers before putting to window. Only takes a little wet and has held up for ages now.

1020,Great product.,5
1021,"Great product.  My brother had some when his little boy was a baby and he always told me that his only piece of advice was to make sure we had black out curtains in the nursery.  With this in mind I thought I'd buy some just in case we needed some when we went on holiday earlier this year.I wasn't disappointed; the quality of the blind is very good and the travel bag is handy for keeping them folded (although I didn't mange to get them back in very well).  The suckers stayed up pretty well over the course of our trip, and we only had to replace the odd one every now again.I did think the product was expensive for what it is, but given  that we've used them on multiple trips and they have not disappointed us I am now convinced that it was money well spent.  I now wouldn't go on holiday without them.",5
1022,"Great product. Attacks hair on the face and neck regions really well. I have been using the 760cc for about 5 years now and was very happy with the shave it gave but still find this even better. Only issue is that I am unable to find the cutter head as a spare. Can't understand why Braun has not yet provided spare heads for this model. In case you need to change the head you would be in deep trouble. The head, at the moment, if at all you find someone selling them, is as expensive as the entire shaver unit.",5
1023,Great product. Completely blocks the light out as long as it is used as instructed.,5
1024,Great product. Does exactly what it’s supposed to.,5
1025,Great product. I’ve ow got 2 for my van,5

1030,Great product. The delivery was changed twice but was worth the wait.,5
1031,"Great product. We use this in my baby girl's room behind her normal black out blind and it omits so much more light. It also folds really small and neat in the bag for travelling, and absorbs heat so that it keeps baby's room cooler during the summerI would definitely recommend it.",5
1032,Great product. Works well with my Moto G4.Don't go thinking you will be able to type much when mounted (Shouldn't be doing that anyway when driving!!) but for SatNav & playing music it's great.,5
1033,Great product. Would not go anywhere without it!!!,5
1034,"Great protection for safe browsing.  Really intuitive to use for my four year old and I can now worry less than when he wanted to use my iPad.  The case is robust and has withstood a four years olds clumsy use so far!  Great selection of programmes and easy for him to find content he loves.Works brilliant with my prime account for films,  I would highly recommend this item.",5

1043,Great service great quality good price!!!,5
1044,Great shaver as I would have expected from brain.,5
1045,Great shaver providing a very close shave with a good battery life (lasts me about a week). The only downside is the price.,5
1046,Great shaver specially if you have sensitive skin prone to acne or hair in growth. My skin is much clearer now (I use it with electric shaving solution) and can get rid of a week's hairgrowth. Money well spent.,5
1047,Great shaver works well.,5
1048,"Great shaver, my partner is chuffed with this. He's fussy about his routine so I didn't know what he'd make of this but he says it gives a really close shave and no irritation. It far outshines his current shaver which has now been binned, that's the ultimate sign of success!",5
1049,"Great shaver, worth paying the extra for this model",5
1050,Great shaver.,5
1051,"Great stuff. Such a simple idea, but it works. I have a 3 months old baby and from week 4 he stopped napping and then I had to struggle to get him to sleep during the day. I can't say the blind worked like a charm, it was a combination of things I had to do to get him to nap, but it did make a difference. It doesn't make the room pitch black or even really dark, but dark enough especially in these hot sunny summer days for the south facing nursery. I like it.",5
1052,Great tablet for kids just what my son needed,5
1053,"Great tablet for kids, full parental control, and an excelent sturdy case.I added a screen protector and now I hope is fully child proof 😁",5
1054,"Great tablet for my boy, he Loves it. Has loads of space, battery lasts for ages and the speed to download anything is quick. We bought another one and sent it back as it was slow, battery didn’t last and didn’t have any space this one is the best. Would def recommend it.",5

1065,great tablet. very easy to use.,5
1066,"Great to have a yellow one! Colour range is very disappointing but this is granddaughter number 2’s favourite colour so she is going to be thrilled. Shame there isn’t a purple one so had to settle for a blue one for granddaughter number 1Brilliant presents for them and I attribute their confidence and ability with computers to having had these Kindles almost from the day they could point a finger! They are now 3 & 5 and to spend 30 minutes on their Kindles winding down before bed, after a busy day running around, is their absolute treat - and we get a bit of peace too!",5
1067,Great to hold my iPhone 6 and easy to slot into my BMW car air vent,5
1068,Great unit - very effective with 3 or 4 day stubble. Much faster to finish shaving than with my  Philishave. The trim unit was better on the Philishave.,5

1081,Great wee first tablet! Love all the parent settings!,5
1082,Great xmas present for my 3 year old. Very sturdy and lots of great app for kids. highly recommend for younger children.,5
1083,"Great, better now that is has offline downloads. Will be nice to see how easy it is to get replaced when my 2 year old decides she hates it one day... Let's see. Worth it for content though. Very good.",5
1084,"Great, did the job brilliantly, had to cut down the length, no problem!, a really good product, I work nights so keeps the sun out when sleeping in the day.",5
1085,"Great, easy to use and holds the phone perfectly.",5
1086,"great, every home should have one for the bright sun.",5
1087,"Great, just as it says in the ad.",5

1096,Grips your phone as you would expect.,5
1097,Grt set for the price,5
1098,Had a few tablets for the kids but this is by far the best. Easy to use and great for downloading things so the kids can still use it without wi-fii,5
1099,"Had an awful manual pump last time which I hated and struggled to express any milk, have just used this or for the first time and painlessly expressed 3oz straight after a feed. Very happy!",5
1100,Had first HD7 kids edition for 12 months so upgraded and bought 2 of the new HD8 edition for my twins they were made up for 5 days kids loved it then one of them wouldn't turn on at all even when plugged in top product and servic Amazon was great and sent replacement next day great service,5
1101,Had one in my car so bought one to replace a cheap one in my van. Good quality,5
1102,"Had the kids kindle fire 7 which unfortunately fell and smashed the screen about 5 months over the warranty. Decided to get my little girl the 8, the bigger screen is great and works a bit faster than the 7. She loved it for the games and watching YouTube! Defo recommend this to anyone considering a tablet.",5
1103,Had to move to temp accomodation and this was perfect! Easy to put up and does a better job than blank out blinds I have had put up by companies,5
1104,Happy with delivery and product,5
1105,Happy with product,5
1106,"Happy with this item. Works perfectly for my car & my phone.Perfect for purpose. Arrived fast too, thank you.",5
1107,Has this was for my daughter and she was very pleased with it has it was a great help to the baby for to get some rest''The Gro Company Gro Anywhere Blackout Blind ...The Gro Company,5
1108,"Has worked really well for me so far. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the bad reviews, especially the ones that said it has damaged their vents and the rubber has split. But it's easy to take my phone in and out of the holder, and so I think I'll just leave it clipped to my vent and not move it! No damage possible! It stays firmly in position without pulling my vent down. It's only been a few days but I have really enjoyed using it.",5
1109,Have been very happy with this blind used during the British summer time to block out the light. My 2.5 year old often noted how dark her room was despite it still being light outside. Easy to put up and take down and easy to manipulate it to fit Windows of different shapes and sizes. Easily folds back up into a small bag if you wanted to pack it to take it with you on holidays,5
1110,Have bought these for my grandsons they love them and their parents have down loaded lots of books for them,5
1111,"have used this alternating with my wet and dry Phillips one. It cuts well, is quiet and easy to clean",5
1112,"Having already received multitudes of different electric shavers from Amazon, it was no great surprise to be offered yet another weapon in the eternal fight against the perils of facial hair. To be honest, my house is already chocked full with the things. I've got an upstairs bathroom shaver, a downstairs bathroom shaver, a travel shaver, a shaver at my mistress' house, a shaver at my other mistress' house, a kitchen shaver, a dining room shaver and a shaver for my garage (I don't actually shave in the garage, mind- I just dumped that one in a corner because it was crap). In the event that I were the type of fellow who can actually be bothered to shave more than once or twice a week, it would be a truly enviable situation. As it is, it primarily just stands as a scathing allegory for the perversity of wealth distribution within the capitalist system.I already own a series 7 Braun, although that particular model is a mere 790cc, which (according to my research on an automotive website) means that the motor has a capacity of a poxy 790 cubic centimetres. This newer model has reached an extraordinarily impressive 9095ccs- which means that the shaver's engine has finally exceeded the truly whopping 9 litre landmark. I'm not sure where it all goes exactly, but presumably it involves a real world technological breakthrough equivalent to the fictionalised one behind the TARDIS. In terms of performance, it's a more than worthy addition to my harem of shaving equipment. Indeed, much like a polygamist with a brand new 21 year old trophy wife taking pride of place amongst a collection of now faded glories, this freshest acquisition is the only piece of equipment that I've been wishing to see rubbed up and down my face for now. I'm sure I'll come back to my other electrics for the warm glow of nostalgia, given time, but for all I care they can just entertain themselves for now. First class.PS. Although it's earned a place as my alpha electric shaver, I wouldn't want to be without my double edged safety razor, on the side. Having invested in 100 x Derby blades, I've got my work cut out to get through the lot of them, before I should leave this earth. To be honest, they're so cheap that you could quite literally just go ahead and wipe your arse with the things. Although I really would prefer to use them for shaving, if at all possible.",5
1113,"I was really pleased with it, was very happy I'd purchased it and found it very effective in all aspects (light reduction, hold on the window, ease of use.) Would definitely recommend.",5
1114, Works like a charm.,5
1115,Having used a series 7 Braun Saver for the last 5/6 years the Series 9 is a definite improvement. The auto cleaning function is very impressive and the battery holds a decent level of charge. Quality product.,5
1116,"Having used this for a week and trying wet (in shower and with foam) and dry shaves, I feel well placed to review.Background: I hardly ever clean shave, preferring a stubble trimmer.  When I do clean shave, it's Wilkinson Sword and shaving foam.Dry shaves:  very comfortable.  No nicking or afterburn.  Not quite as good as a clean shave with a razor but a very clean and tidy lookWet shave (shower): not having a shower mirror made this slightly difficult but I percevered nevertheless.  I found it to be less effective than the dry shave and actually felt some drag on my skin, leaving it slightly red in the lower neck area afterwards.Shaving foam shave: wet face, applied shaving foam.  Very comfortable shave.  I'd say it's as good as a razor shave.  Very smooth afterwards.Cleaning: easy. Take off head, rinse under water, brush out chamber (if dry shave).  Other shaves, rinse under water does it.  This also has a cleaning unit that takes a lubricating methanol mix which when the shaver is inserted and the cleaning programme activated, pumps the fluid into the chamber, rinses away and drys the shaver head.  Pretty neat.  It's got 3 cleaning programmes but for whatever reason have only ever had it on the most intense - more research needed there.It comes with a hard case, lead, cleaning unit, 1* cleaning fluid, brush and shaver.Downside: none really.  Have realised I still look relatively youthful without stubble so maybe that's the way forward.  The one thing letting it down is the sides trimmer at the back which is pretty poor compared to the one on my stubble trimmer but that's about it.",5
1117,"Having used this razor for the past 3 months I'm happy to confirm its excellence. I get a consistently excellent and comfortable shave with the Brawn Series 9, the cost of the CCR3 Clean and Renew refills does seem expensive but it's such a joy to be able to pick up the shaver each morning and for it to be perfectly clean, fresh, and ready to go.",5
1118,"Having wet shaved for 30 plus years I decided to take the plunge and go electric. It is not cheap (even with £100.00 knocked off the price), but you get a great deal of bang for your buck (so to speak). The charging/cleaning station is great, the build quality overall is excellent and the shave you get is amazing. No more razor burn or tissue paper covering the cuts.It takes some getting used to and it is a bit loud, but for those of you who suffer from sensitive skin and razor burn (especially on the neck) it is worth (in my opinion) making the change.",5
1119,Helps keep a very bright bedroom blacked out for my grandson.  Stays up well (dampen the suction caps slightly if you are using them).  Would recommend.,5
1120,Helps my little one sleep during the night.  Really does a great job of blacking out the room.,5
1121,"Highly recommend, occasionally the suckers don't stick but if you persevere then it will work. Take it everywhere.",5
1122,Highly recommended. I've downloaded mx player and also downloaded some cartoons for offline watch. Mx player has an option to lock the screen while playing video so toddler like mines 2 years can't exit video with accidental touch. She absolutely loves it. Sits in her pram without any complaints,5
1123,Highly useful for keeping the sun out. Adjusting size is a bit fiddly but suckers are v strong and keep it up.,5
1124,Hold phone firmly and secures nicely to air vent,5
1125,Holds iPhone 5s well in vents of focus ‘07 plate.,5
1126,"Holds my iPhone 7 Plus really strongly, and the clips fits my VW Golf mk6 (2009) vents great.",5
1127,Holds my phone steady even on uneven surfaces.  Very pleased with product.,5
1128,Holds my phone... everything I ever wanted from this product 👍,5
1129,Holds phone. Exactly what I needed.,5
1130,Holds Samsung s7 firmly in place and fits vents in BMW Z4 securely Much better option than windscreen attachments Easy to insert and remove phone,5
1131,"Holds the iPhone 6s perfectly with or without case. The air vent attachment is tight enough to not let the phone move around. It even holds firm my phone with its thicker Anker battery case on too. Small a discreet too, it doesn't stick out like other large cradles",5
1132,"Holds the phone well, fits onto my vent without falling off. Good buy.",5
1133,How did we live without this before. It's been a godsend this summer. The suckers did arrive a little squashed but who cares. It's a wonderful item. I wouldn't be without it.,5
1134,Husband loved this,5
1135,"I absolutely love it, easy to fit, and cuts out all of the light in my bedroom, easy to take down too, but prefer it up as I love the dark. Can't rate against the old version as I have never used it, but as I said earlier, really easy to use, and cuts out light. Just make sure if you are buying for home window like me that you measure the window first!",5
1136,I already had a manual pump so wasn't sure if it was worth investing in an electric pump but this one is fab. I managed to get twice as much milk in half the time and felt confident enough to leave my son with my husband for the first time. It was really comfortable with 6 different suction strengths that I could increase as I went along.,5
1137,"I am 100% in love with this blind, my 1yr old was having trouble falling & staying asleep as his bedroom window faces the rear of the house & get all the sunlight all day. The suckers occasionally take a bit of persuading to stick but now I just leave it up 24/7 unless we're going away. If you have double glazing & plastic frames I recommend sticking the blind on the frame completely covering the window instead of on the glass to prevent the most light getting in :)",5
1138,"I am 70 years old and over the years have used a variety of razors (blades as well as electrics) all of which gave a good or decent shave but this is and I truly mean it is absolutely great...oh yes it is expensive and it was a special birthday present of my choosing but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for...as for concerns about tthe cleaning and using the cartriges I simply brush clean it after each shave then clean and charge it in the unit once a week and it ALWAYS gives me a smooth face each morning, only problem is when I wake up in the mornings the beard has grown again BUT I suspect that is just one of those little problems we men have to live with, just as the ladies in our lives have their problems too!!",5
1139,"I am a nighttmare for lifting my phone and using it whilst driving.This car mount phone holder is perfect for people like me.It is easy to install, simply click into your air vent and your ready too use.My phone (Samsung S5) fits into it perfectlyIt will fit any phone. It has a good comfort grip which ensures no damage is done to your mobile.It has a 360 rotation which makes it super easy to see your phoneAll in all this wee gadget will save me from handling my phone whilst driving",5
1140,"I am awarding 5 stars mainly because of price. They are much smaller in size than expected but having said that, came in a small plastic bag, in a box with a card. I accidentally ordered two, but will keep one pair for any unexpected gifts.",5
1141,"I am so impressed with this product. I was a little worried that the low price would be suggestive of a poor quality product, but that just isn't the case with this breast pump! It is not only great value for money but also amazing quality. I love the comfort of the pump, it's easy to assemble and clean. The letdown reflex is very gentle on the nipple and always manages to obtain milk from my breast as a result. I have not really had to adjust the settings from the default because it works so well for me. The wire is nice and long so that I don't have to sit right next to a plug socket, and I love that I have the option to put batteries into the machine, as I will be doing this when using the pump away from home. It is a sleek design which doesn't occupy much space in the house. Also nice and quiet to use.My only criticism would be that my previous tommee tippee pump provided me with a microwave sterilizer to use for cleaning, and this one didn't. Luckily for me, I still had the sterilizer, which I have been using for this pump. The box almost has everything you would need to use the pump - it's missing said sterilizer and a carry case would be nice for when pumping away from home.",5
1142,"I am thrilled, I can finally shave my face everyday without any pain or wound. My face is very much sensetive and I always had problem ic I needes to shave a day earlier than supposed to, but now, i can shave everyday and i don't have any problem. This product is absolutely amazing. Well done Braun",5
1143,I am using the black out blind in my grandsons bedroom and it is brilliant as we are going into the summer nights and it stays lighter in the evening. I'm would recommend it to everybody.,5
1144,I am very pleased with my new Braun Series 9 shaver having been a series 7 user. It definitely produces a smoother cleaner shave and I am very happy with both the price as well as the design of the new shaver.,5
1145,I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it.Spacing of suction cups and Velcro make this surprisingly versatile (fitting odd window shapes).Suction cups are set away from the edge so blind can overlap the frame and keep light out.Slightly stiff material keeps it in place when adjusting it.Not too heavy.Material blocks out light completely.I am happy with price to quality of product ratio.Would not hesitate to purchase again if needed.,5
1146,I am well pleased with this so again five stars,5
1147,"I bought one of these with hesitation as I've heard some negative reviews on the phones being too heavy for the mount etc, but this Air Vent Mount is absolutely fantastic. I was very close to leaving an awful review when I first bought it, but I realised the mount has 2 settings: thick or thin vent mount. I was putting the thick mount onto thin vents on my car and it kept falling off! Now I've realised I was making a mistake, it's remained in the same place for over 6 months and it's fantastic! It's sturdy, my phone looks great it in and I can still swerve left and right if I need to. Highly recommend!",5
1148,I bought some roller black out blinds which came off the roll within a week so bought these and I wish I had gone with the gro blind in the first place! Speedy delivery. Does the job. Perfect.,5
1149,"I bought the matching necklace as a lightning deal, so bought these matching earrings, and why not indeed?!They look fab, small and sparkly, understated not ostentatious, I love them.",5
1150,"I bought the new Braun Series 9 to replace my Braun Series 7 shaver. When I first took it out of its box I saw just how 'blingy'  it looked with lots of chrome on it. I then read then booklet that came with and it recommended that I must charge it to its full capacity before I use it. this I did do.  I normally shave every morning but I had deliberately missed a day so that I had 48 hours beards growth to just see how it shaved that much growth. I always use a Pre Electric shave lotion. I was really delighted just how smoothly and cleanly it shaved the 48 hour beard growth, it was closer than my Braun Series 7. Shaving above the top lip was no problem whatsoever, providing you lock the head in to position as recommended..much nicer than using my Braun 7. Getting a clean shave under the chin and neck really does cause problems with me but the 9 is superb, a lovely clean shave I am getting with this shaver. The shaver sits nicely in your hand and is very comfortable to hold and shave with. When fully charged it lasts much longer the my Braun 7 and is quieter. I weighed the Braun 7 and it weighed 220 grams, the Braun 9 weighs 218 grams so very little difference there. As I said before it has a fair bit of chrome on the 9 and thought at the time I would be forever cleaning finger marks but that it is not happening.I have also used the Series 9 as a wet shaver. I use Tabac shaving soap along with a Boar bristle shaving brush and you will find that you get a fantastic wet shave. All you have to do is keep rinsing the shaver under hot running water during your shave, once you have had your shave just rinse it out under the hot running water, and then put the shaver in to its cleaning station and its like new again, don't be afraid to try it as a wet shaver, you will be in for really big surprise just how good a shave you get.The Cleaning Station is rather a big and ugly looking thing and but it does its job. When cleaning the shaver it is not as noisy as the Braun 7 cleaning station but I do prefer the layout on the 7 station.I do recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver if you considering a new shaver,",5
1151,I bought these as a gift for someone and they loved them so much they wanted a second pair :)!,5
1152,"I bought these as a gift, they are beautiful",5
1153,"I bought these to use in our son's room on a holiday in the canaries. They are easy to put up, stayed put really well and were very effective. Our 20 month old son slept soundly all week and they also stopped the room from heating up too much. Since returning I have used them in our bedroom behind the venetian blinds as these let the sun in in the morning. They've worked great and I haven't woken up at 5-5.30 with the birds each morning as I had before. Would definitely recommend them as a great quality and effective product.",5
1154,"I bought this as I was going away for the weekend in the highlands and there was no wifi where we were staying.  When this came I was able to install all the required applications (BBC iPlayer Kids and Netflix) and download content with 1 hour, which is all the time I had and needed.My 5 year loves this!  Very intuitive user interface.  He was able to home in on the CBBies application and get that install and running with no issues.Still to test the robustness this of it, but the case looks like it will take a hammering and is wide enough to prevent damage of a screen if a younger one mistakenly gets hold of it an uses it like a chew toy (happened to my wife's phone).Camera could be better, and not great in low light, but at this price point and for the intended audience (5 year old), this doesn't warrant marking down the product.",5
1155,"I bought this as its getting lighter later on in the evening and I have a 10 month old who will only fall asleep in the dark, it does the trick he has even started sleeping in later than usual, only problem I found is that it holds a lot of heat so take it down through the day and put it back up but other than that it's brilliant.",5
1156,I bought this as we were staying with a relative for 3 weeks. The blind has been up for over 2 weeks and is still in place. It provides excellent blackout properties and is so practical with the Velcro strips to adjust the size. The suction cups are great quality and stay firmly in place.,5
1157,I bought this as we're staying in temporary accommodation and didn't want to buy a more permanent one that we'd have to leave behind. We also took it on holiday which was handy. It folds up quite flat so easily packed. My little girl doesn't sleep well in a bright room and this blind keeps the room really dark. It does have Velcro bits so you can adjust the size to fit your window. Some of the suckers sometimes aren't keen to stick but I give mine a wipe with a baby wipe and they stick fine. Great blind for occasional use but not sure it's the best thing for all the time.,5
1158,I bought this because my 17momths old would wake up around 3am in the summer and think it's day time. I wanted something big and versatile because we have a bay window in our bedroom and its big. The Gro Anywere blind works great. It's big. It's dark. And it has suction cups so I don't have to install another rail or anything just stick it to the window.,5
1159,"I bought this blackout blind as a replacement of a similar competitor bling with a round shape, I just got fed up of trying to fit a round shaped blind onto a square window.This product is very good. It attached easily, if you struggle with the large self-adhesives, simply apply some water on them. The blind is very generous size and we have taken it away when on holidays as it covers fairly large windows. Easy to re-size to a small window too.",5
1160,"I bought this blind as i needed something that i could take along while travelling to visit my family in law. It's completely dark in my son's bedroom at home and he wakes up really early when we are staying elsewhere. With this gro anywhere blackout blind, we can create the same environment anywhere we go. Brilliant.",5
1161,I bought this blind in the hopes of cutting-out early morning light through a large velux window which was waking me up systematically around 4:30 every morning this summer. I felt like I was turning into a zombie through lack of sleep!  AT LAST - I can now sleep through to a respectable hour! Thank you so much to this blind which has given me back a normal sleeping pattern! A++,5
1162,I bought this cautiously as a number of people said the suckers weren't great. I put it up in our spare room 2 days ago without any issue and it's still up now. Taking it on holiday with us next month - great product thanks,5
1163,"I bought this for my 3 year old Godson and it’s brilliant. There are so many games and features for him to grow in to. If you need your child/ren to sit quietly while you get on with other things, you can’t do much better than this to keep them safely occupied and amused. It’s a great learning tool, as well as super entertaining. The parent lock features mean the kids can browse freely without you having to worry, and the casing makes it drop proof - perfect for a younger child. The only problem you’re likely to encounter getting your little one to put it down!",5
1164,I bought this for my 3 year old Grandson he is delighted with it! He finds it easy to useRecommended buy!,5
1165,I bought this for my children's room but it's now in my room..Would recommend this to every single person out there to get a better night sleep and to not be woken by the early morning sun.,5
1166,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It comes with the added bonus of a years free fire for kids which is really good!,5
1167,"I bought this for my nephew. He is able to access learning apps, fun games and videos without the worry he may access unsuitable content. As it can grow with him I hope it will last a good while.",5
1168,I bought this for my son who absolutely loves it. I no longer have to worry about what he is watching as everything is age appropriate. There are fun games and also educational apps. Not to mention books and videos galore. Would highly recommend.,5
1169,I bought this for my two year old granddaughter's birthday. She has mastered quite a few of the apps and bounces the tablet around unmercifully without it breaking. She loves it. Highly recommended.,5
1170,I bought this for my youngest son's room as we did not want to buy a permanent blind. This is so easy to put up/take down & keeps out the sunlight that was waking him at the crack of dawn. It is so good we bought one for our older son's room as well. We haven't taken them away with us but if we were to go away then they are so portable we would definitely take them. The only thing we have to look out for is that we take the blinds down when the boys wake as the sun shining onto the window not only makes the room very hot but the window pane as well.,5
1171,"I bought this for our son as his bedroom was particularly light when going to bed, and was also the first room to catch the morning light.It's made a huge difference in the summer months, the suction cups work fine (even though I've read a lot of people having problems with them), I've never had it fall down yet.The included velcro is good for sticking parts together to create a 'curtained' effect, but I find it most effective to pull the blind as tight as possible and stick to the corners of the window.Very strongly recommend this product if you think light is causing a problem, it has significantly darkened our child's bedroom, and is very quick and easy to assemble.",5
1172,"I bought this holder & had afew issues with it, patox asked me what i thought of it so told them it was ok but didn't hold my phone properly as the arm was too loose. They sent me another one completely free of charge as they wanted me to be totally satisfied with what i bought, i didn't even ask them to! The new one is much better & works well. A fantastic company that really look after their customers, very much recomended",5
1173,I bought this in the hope that my children would go to sleep quicker in the summer months and WOW has it worked! My children are no longer tired and grumpy in the daytime. It fits easily onto windows and removes easily during the day. Very simple but we'll thought about product,5
1174,"I bought this item to replace a bulkier broken phone holder. This one is very compact & holds my BlackBerry Passport SE very well. It has 2 sizes of slots on the rubberised clip to fit different sized airvents, & holds my phone well. Delivery was quick. Would recommend.",5
1175,I bought this not for a child but for my boyfriend who moves around a lot. This is very versatile and the decoration was acceptable for child or adult.,5
1176,I bought this razor for my Labrador and he is really pleased with it. It give a fabulous scrotal trim and sorts his beard out nice. Buy this if you want a close scrotal trim,5
1177,"I bought this shaver over a year ago, and I am happy to say it still works as well as the first day I received it.Prior to getting this shaver I have always used a wet shave, but I am now converted to electric.I have no hesitation in recommending this well made product.",5
1178,I bought this specifically for the parental controls and they are great!,5
1179,I bought this to block out what others could see while  decorating a room from the street as many like to peer in when no windo covers were up ...  but have used it travelling as well,5
1180,"I bought this to take on our first holiday for my son as he has always slept with blackout blinds at home and I was worried the light might disturb him. It blocked out all light. At first I didn't think it would stay put as it is only held up with suction pads, but in fact it stayed firmly in place for the whole time we were there. A fantastic purchase (I am now considering buying a second for myself!)",5
1181,"I bought this to take to hospital for my labour, but have also used at home. Its a good size, is easy to use and does completely black out any light",5
1182,"I bought this to try and get my 2 year old to sleep past 5:45am when the sun his his bedroom window. Well...let me say that a lie in till 7:30 certainly confirmed this product works, and works well. The room is dark and it also keeps the room cool all day so a good place for him to nap too. It's a bit of a pain putting up and sizing but with a bit of patience it's worth it. I recommend to parents looking to provide a darker room in summer months.",5
1183,"I bought this with varying expectations. I was mainly worried about sturdiness due to fitting it into my BMW Z4 which really feels the bumps. My phone stays sturdy with this item, its much smaller and less intrusive in comparison to other phone mounts. I like the fact it is also easy to make the phone vertical or horizontal with very little effort.Good quality product, i would recommend.",5
1184,"I can finally sleep! And believe me, if your window or door-window is clean the suction cups works perfeclty. I staterd to use it 2 days ago when I received it. Easy to fit and it kept in position all night until I took it off from the glass the morning after. Very happy with my purchase and probably going to buy a second one.",5
1185,"I can't work out how people can't stick this to the window. You do have to lick the suckers, but thats fine. It's really good though.",5
1186,"I cannot recommend these tablets enough. We brought them for Christmas last year (2016) for my girls (2&4) the kids function is amazing! They choose what they want to do & I never have to worry about what they’re doing. I can monitor their usage & see what they’re doing whilst I’m at work.The cases are great and after a year of my daughters dropping and even standing on them, we have just had our first incident they’re designed really well too.I have also for the first time had to use the replacement service as daughter number 2 damaged the devices. I was on the phone for about 5 minutes and I have 2 new tablets coming tomorrow with no questions asked.Amazing service!! Worth the extra you pay for the kids tablet. Have raved about these since I brought them !!",5
1187,I couldn’t be more pleased with my kids HD 8 Kindle fire. It is my sons favorite Christmas gift by far. He watches his favorite shows and plays age related games. It’s easy to use and great parent control. Would definitely recommend!,5
1188,I decided to move from manual pump to electric and I'm really glad I chose this pump. It takes about 10-15 minutes for me to express one breast which is much quicker (and less hassle) than the hand held manual.,5
1189,"I did a bit of research prior to my purchase, and found this to be consistently the highest-rated tablet for children across many of trusted review sites. So after much hoo-ing and hah-ing thereafter, decided to go ahead and order one for my wee boy's third birthday: and I can honestly say I do not regret it one little bit, the tablet is excellent for  him with the Fire For Kids application running and with it turned off so that it's in a normal profile for adults it is also a more than capable tablet. Great for everyday use (I wouldn't be one for resource-heavy applications like the newest 3D games so can't really comment on those but any games/apps which I did download ran very smoothly), and fantastic battery life make this a must for modern young kids who constantly want to borrow your expensive smartphone/tablet!!",5
1190,"I didn't realise that this was clearly intended for children, hence the decorative moons and stars all over it. I can't complain though, the room is pitch black in the mornings when previously it was pretty much daylight, does the job fantastically.",5
1191,"I don't how I went without this kind of shaver before, it's everything I expected and more 10/10",5
1192,I don't know how we managed before we bought this product!My husband works shifts and he sleeps much better through the day with this blind. Would definitely recommend this product.,5
1193,I don't know what I'd do without them! I have one of each of my children's bedroom windows and we take them wherever we go. They fit on every window I've come across and they immediately plunge the room into darkness. I couldn't recommend them more highly.,5
1194,I find shaver & equipment very good for my purpose.,5
1195,"I found the single electric breast pump really easy to use, and easy to keep clean too!  I didn't find the noise of it pumping too obtrusive compared to other pumps that my friends had used.  It is also pretty small - I was able to fit it in my handbag when I went out for the evening and needed to pump!  Easy to use whilst breastfeeding at the same time.  Would highly recommend.",5
1196,I found this portable blackout blind a great solution to my son waking so early in the sunny mornings. I whip it up at bedtime (most days I leave it up) and the room is completely dark. The suction cups make it so easy and I use the Velcro squares to taper to my narrow but long window. I was concerned about how the house would look at this window when keeping it hung but it literally just looks like a back window so no squatters here ;o),5
1197,I found this razor gives a wonderful close shave without to much effort . It also holds its charge very well as you are not useing to much of the charge to obtain the required effect,5
1198,I get on really well with his pump and would recommend it. It is useful having all the different levels. I have used it everyday for the last 4 months and have had to replace the nib that the milk comes out of into the bottle but you get spares in the box and parts are easy to get from lansinoh. It only got damaged because I wished it too vigorously! I am a fan of all the lansinoh products.,5
1199,I give this blind 5 stars. Exactly what I wanted and perfect for my son's room. Very happy. Worth every penny.,5
1200,I got this car mount for my boyfriend. He loves it! it's simple oto use without issues. The size is not overwhelming in the car. It holds the phone without hassles.,5
1201,I had a faulty mobile phone cradle which I communicated to the company and they were great sorting it out for me. Within a week had a more sturdy and better one through the post. Very good service,5
1202,"I had a medella pump before this one and I thought that was great until I found this one! Others on the market seem to not really think about comfort but this one comes with a silicone shield which is really comfy and a godsend at times. Settings are mild to strong, so whichever you're comfortable with. So easy to clean and not that loud. Portable too. But eats up batteries, so be sure to take the charger, which is miles long. Making it much easier to sit in your favourite chair and not have to worry about sitting right next to a socket.Much better price than many 'recommended/leading' ones like the medella. Which is only the recommended by midwives one because it's the one the nhs use. But by far this one is the better product with a much better price.",5
1203,"I had a Series 5 for years, it finally packed up and I paid the extra for the Series 9. This is far and away the best electric razor I have ever tried, it shaves as close as a blade and in half the time the Series 5 used to take.",5
1204,I had a very similar one of these but left it in a rental car.  I was surprised to find this one at a much lower price than I paid for the first one.  I feared that it would be inferior but it is actually even better.  Much better fit into the vents and stays put.  Must tight grip on the phone.  Bought two and was a great investment. Simple and effective.,5
1205,"I had always wet shaved, tried a tri head shaver (useless) got this bad boy and OMG. Sooooo good. Gives me a good close shave on a par with wet shaving, but no irritation, cuts or soreness.  Took me 2 shaves for my skin to become accustomed to this.",5
1206,"I have a few Gro products and bought this to actually use day to day as my daughters room is just a little to light still even with blackout slats , this is easy to use, sticks to the window really well and the Velcro ( which you use to put it to the size that suits ) works really well, the blind is very long so I've had to Velcro it up a lot and it's fine. Another great Gro product",5
1207,i have a large bedroom window & this fits great,5
1208,I have a long narrow window and this fits almost perfectly. Although the blind doesn’t quite stretch the whole length of the window this doesn’t appear to be a problem. My baby’s room is definitely much darker as a result.,5
1209,"I have always bought the best shavers available as I have a tough beard growth and need a quality shaver. My last two shavers have been Braun's, the latest being the top 7 series razor. This one however is the ultimate in shaving, it's much quieter then the 7 series and the shave is so much closer. There is absolutely no snagging of the skin or even the most stubborn of hairs. The cleaning system is a lot better than previous versions and with the fan drying feature, leaves the razor in a lovely clean and ready to use state. I am well impressed with this razor and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone.",5
1210,I have been looking for crystal drop earrings for some time & these are exactly what I wanted.  Easy to wear and lovely sparkle.,5
1211,"I have been using the Mpow phone holder in my car for a while now. I currently drive an Honda Civic 2011. It fits perfectly on the middle air vent. I have done around 5000 mile in the past few months and this phone holder has done the job perfectly. Its very discreet whilst there is no phone in the holder.As this clips into the air vents in the car it stops the horrible rings appearing on your windscreen which is big selling point for me as they drive me insane.Clipping a phone into this holder isn't the easiest thing in the world to do... But it does get easier. I have seen better methods on other devices such as ratcheting sliders and expanding buttons. But they are a bit more expensive. Once the phone is in the holder it will stay put for the entire journey,",5
1212,I have been using this blind for 2 years and it really is blackout and portable. It has Velcro and suckers to be suitable for all circumstances and only takes seconds to fit and pack. Highly recommended,5
1213,"I have been very pleased with my new Braun shaver, the best I have ever had, so smooth and quiet yet so efficient. Easy to use, easy to clean.",5
1214,I have black out blinds in my house so my kids won't sleep unless it is more or less pitch black so this was great to bring on holidays. I ended up buying two of these and keeping one in each car to make sure we don't forget. Ended up using once myself in hotel with very light curtain. Great purchase,5
1215,"I have bought a couple of these type in the past, albeit at very cheap prices, they all eventually broke or came apart and didn't last long.This one is a lot more sturdy than the others, the feel is also much better. It is higher quality and definitely the best one I've used so far.",5
1216,"I have bought one for my sister in law, and 3 for my house ! At last, blackout that you can remove. I previously had stuff jumpers and all sorts round the side of the windows coupled with Velcro blackout stuff designed for people who work night shifts. That meant that my kids played in their rooms with the lights on as it was too much hassle to remove all the stuff in the day.Anyway, this product is excellent, easily adjustable, good videos online to see what to do and a simple idea. I take it with me now whenever I go to somewhere where I know there will be thin curtains !",5
1217,"I have had this attached to a window for a few days now and it works well, was very easy to install and performed perfectly well.  Only advice is make sure its the right size, great of its bigger than the window because its easy to fit with the velcro bits!",5
1218,"I have loved this, it has kept the sun out!",5
1219,I have never seen a pair of earrings so attractive i really do love them so much thankyou a lot,5
1220,"I have not tried this one yet, as it's for my granddaughter's birthday but it looks good and came very quickly.",5
1221,I have owned many elec shavers over the years but this is the closest and i love the new cleaning machine. Theyhave put the fan back into it (prev version had crap passive cooling).I tried a Philips recently and it dragged the hair out my face so went back and got on of these,5
1222,"I have shaved with a Braun for over 40 years, this is definitely a great improvement.It arrived the next day as promised. No complaints .",5
1223,I have tried a few blackout blinds due to being a light sleeper. This is the best I have used. Easy to put up and down and to also use when staying over elsewhere or in hotels. Great product.,5
1224,"I have tried a few electric shavers over the years and this probably stands as the best of them.  It can be used wet and dry (and even copes with foam - but not sure why you would do that).  It charges quickly, feels nice in the hand, but most importantly gives you a close shave quickly.  No doubt about the quality of this shaver - and I have always had good service from my previous Braun shavers - so I don't doubt it will give years of service.  This is not cheap - but if you can afford it (and get it on a deal) then I recommend.",5
1225,I have tried holders that attach to the windscreen but all of them eventually fell off. So I decided to try this with my iPhone 7+.I have been using it full time for about 1 month with no problems.,5
1226,I have two and works greats they don't full off window if you wet them a little,5
1227,"I have two of these now, one stays up in my little ones room and the other is at the childminders. They really do totally blackout the room which my baby prefers. Great when you go away as it packs up really small.",5
1228,"I have two of these, one up in my childrens room and one i keep as a spare for grannies. Suckers to window (although i have it stuck to the window frame to get a better fit on my windows) and i think i only have o fix it once a month when a few suckers pop off. Has a velcro system so you can make the blind smaller to fit various window sizes. All in all one of the more essential (if youre child likes to sleep in the dark) baby items and one i have used the most.",5
1229,"I just love it. I have a really big window, and I would wake up around 5 am due to the light in the room. Gro arrived really quickly, I was looking forward to try it out.The bag is very useful when you need to travel with it or put it away. the gro is easy to apply on the window and the Velcro is a nice touch for people like me who just leave the gro on the window and need some light in the room during day hours.Ever since I got it I can sleep longer and deeper, I'm really happy with this purchase!",5
1230,I like but the price is expensive for a shaver.,5
1231,"I like how rugged it is, my little one has stood on it, dropped it, got splash drops on it and it hasn’t marked it in anyway. It’s a good little tablet for little ones. And the content is great on it.",5
1232,I like the look of this product. I hope my son will love it as I do.,5
1233,"I like this product, apart from having to fiddle a bit to fix it on the window, once done, it hasn't come off for a very long time, I recommend this to anyone who is looking to darken the room a bit.",4
1234,"I love it so much, very fast and useful.",5
1235,I love it! Comment from grandson aged 5,5
1236,"I love it. Easy to size to window due to strong Velcro adjusters, suckers are sturdy and adhere well, stops my baby waking too early from morning sun.",5
1237,I love the fact that you can achieve a complete blackout. The product is also versatile as it can be taken down easily. In our family we have four of these blinds and each household has found  them to be an excellent buy.,5
1238,"I love the set up and parental control, I can relax while my boy plays on it and know nothing is going to pop up that shouldn’t for him to click on",5
1239,I love them,5
1240,I love these earrings and I will probably get some more for presents',5
1241,"I love these earrings, they are just the right size for work and not heavy on the earlobe. A good buy.",5
1242,"I love this blackout blind as it does exactly as described.The only downside is that my son still doesn't sleep all night but he's doing better than before, so that's a start!Great purchase, easy to put up & take down again, doesn't fall off during the night as suction cups get pressed into windowsill - would recommend using a little water on the suction cups each night to keep the blind in place as will stick much better.",5
1243,I love this blind! I bought it because my Daughter is waking up daily at 4am because of the light shining round the edge of my blackout lined curtains. I put it up myself in less than 5 minutes. I dampened the suction cups & they've stuck strong to the pvc frame! It has made my room pitch black even mid afternoon on  bright June day. Plus its £13 cheaper than boots!,5
1244,I love this Fire HD 8 Tablet! It does everything I expected such as Internet + emails and the seperate kids profile is reassuring. I am pleased with screen and sound quality.,5
1245,I love this product because it does what it is meant to do and blocks out all light.  I am unable to use them though as I find the black plastic backing and the window glass acts as a conductor for heat and during the hot weather it is unbearably hot sleeping near the window.I have reverted to wearing an eye patch.  That said I did take the blind along with us when we hired a caravan for a short holiday and as the weather was still lovely and cool sleeping was bliss with this blind as all the light was blocked out.,5
1246,"I love this product, a good size, easy to use and my 3 year old son hasn’t put it down since getting it, fantastic!!I would advise anyone to get this!",5
1247,I love this product! It's great at darkening the room on a bright day. A small amount of light still gets through but you have to expect that! My little one sleeps much better now I use the black out blind & I can take it anywhere!,5
1248,I love this pump! I have tried a manual pump & an electric pump from other brands (Philips Avent & Medela) & thought they were good until I tried this one. It has a let down settting & you can change the pump strength. It's really comfortable as it comes with a soft liner & it's not even that noisy. I'd definitely recommend.,5
1249,"I love this, take it with me on all my travels now. No more waking up at dawn!",5
1250,I love this!!! It comes everywhere with us when we stay away now!,5
1251,I need this never mind the child :op I'm joking but brilliant,5
1252,"I need to set the scene a little here. Firstly, I prefer a wet shave with a blade and there's no electric razor will deliver a shave as close as a blade, nor should you expect it to do so.That being said, I do a lot of international travel with my work and due to jet lag and tiredness, I don't always feel like shaving with a blade. I've tried a few electric razors, but none of them have come close to delivering a good enough shave to go to work, they leave my face a little sore and battery life is pretty poor.Then I decided to splash out any buy the Braun Series 9095CC. Before writing this review, I decided to use it everyday for the full cycle of the battery life from a single charge. That's important to me because of my international travel.Here's some simple bullet points rather than reading reams of text:The battery lasted for a whole month after a shave every single day and still had 2 bars left on the battery indicator.It's the closest shave I've ever had from an electric razor.It doesn't leave my face feeling sore.It doesn't snag when shaving 3-day growth.The 40,000 cutting cycles per minute make sure that it's fast and super smooth.It has a very sturdy case for travelOverall then, from a guy who prefers a wet shave with a blade, this comes pretty close and is perfect for those times when you just want a no-fuss, quick shave.It's superb and I'd certainly buy it again.",5
1253,"I purchased 2, one for each of my children's bedrooms. They really do work, you may get a small bit of light coming through around the handle for the windows (I have UPVC) as it is difficult to go round with the blind but it really is a great product. My little girl now sleeps for about an hour longer in the mornings, it hasn't affected my son's rising time but he no longer insists ""it's still morning"" when he's going to bed!I also took them on holiday and they were really a blessing as we had a flood light right outside our appartment.I would recommend them highly.",5
1254,"I purchased this as my 3 year old kept waking at 6am regardless of what time he went to bed. Since using the blackout blind he has been waking up at least an hour later each day. It's easy to put up & take down, I couldn't be without it now!",5
1255,"I purchased this for my 7 year old for Christmas and have been very pleased with it. We were considering getting a second iPad for her which I thought would be better (albeit more expensive) but this is perfect and much better for her age. it gives me the peace of mind to leave her to play on it and know that she can't access anything that she shouldn't be watching or accidentally click on items she shouldn't. Also the function to switch it off after a set amount of time or at bedtime is excellent and she knows when it closes down, that it for the day!There are plenty of apps for her to play on and videos etc. Its also no trouble for me to download videos and games etc onto my profile and then transfer them onto hers. Very very pleased with it.",5
1256,I purchased this for my almost 2 year old for Christmas.  It's been brilliant he absolutely loves it and can now work out how to put his own favourite cartoons on as it is very simple to use. The parental features are also great and very easy to use. The Firefox kids subscription is excellent and I will definitely be continuing with this once the free year has finished. The case is easily cleaned and very sturdy. It's been dropped had drinks and food spilt on it and is still in perfect working order. Also easy grip for little hands to hold. Couldn't recommended this product enough. Excellent value for money.,5
1257,"I purchased this for my grandchilds bedroom window. bit of a fiddle to put up as the window is smaller than the blind, but once made to fit is ok. it is very good and blocks out all the light ,enabling my grandchild to sleep during the light nights",5
1258,"I purchased this to replace my series 7 which did a good job but I got the upgrade itch. The shaver I find is a vast improvement over the 7 series I spent almost half the the time it took me with the 7 to get get a smooth finish. The additional cutting head added to the foil helps it took an hour to fully charge then it was ready to go.  The cleaning station takes 40 mins to clean the shaver 10 mins cleaning 30 drying, the station has a fan built in to aid the drying process where as the 7 series station has a heating element. I'm very pleased with the purchase it your looking to buy the best you can't go wrong with this.",5
1259,"I rarely leave reviews, but i can honestly say this product was perfect.I have spent month trying to find a decent phone holder and most on the markey look cheap and fiddly.I was sceptical with this one, as it isnt big, but for the price i thought id take a punt and i wasnt disappointed.It doesnt move about, it holds the phone in place perfectly and i have no concerns of it ever falling out.It does move when u try to use ur phone in the holder, but if fittedin an appropriate place, u just push the phone againt something solid and it doesnt move again.All round a great product and i certainly would hesitate to buy more or recommend to others.",5
1260,"I read a lot about the suckers not working so I was worried that I would wake up to the curtain on the floor. That was not the case!I had a little trouble with one sucker but only took like 3 attempts to stick it down in the space of like a minute. After that, it held up all night and I’m pretty pleased.If you follow instructions it will stick. 👍🏻",5
1261,"I really like them they are very good quality, not to big. I have only worn them twice and have have already had some good comments, I have definitely recommend yourselves & will continue to do so to others.",5
1262,I really like this product. Darkens the room really well & no problems with the suction cups. Has now been up for 3 days & hasn't fallen. The suction cups go all the way around the curtain. Quite large too which is great for my windows. Will be trying this on my summer holiday too as it packs away quite small.,5
1263,I really love sparkly earrings and these have been very well worn over the holidays.  I will continue to wear them a lot.,5
1264,I received the next day. I have set it up which was very easy. Camera and clarity are excellent quality. The case seems sturdy and good quality. Kids pack is great I think my son will love this.,5
1265,"I suffer from a conditon known as Cluster Headaches and find this product Absolutely brilliant when my light sensitivity kicks in during an attack, has the added bonus of providing day time peace for naps when my baby is asleep, I find it helps if you put your finger in your mouth and press down on the middle of the suction cup before applying it to the window, obviously if your too P.C for saliva use water lol and when you have pressed the Velcro together, fold down the excess so it isn't sticking out as this allows light through, I can not see where people go wrong with this, I have a TINY window and if you are patient and follow the instructions no matter how bothersome it is or unnecessary to you then it'll work on a vent if you want it to for Christ sake. Have patience and follow the instructions 😊😊😊",5
1266,"I tend to wet-shave most of the time as I don't shave every day, and have a few electric shavers which I use for convenience such as travel or when I want a quick shave every day. The first thing I noticed with this shaver is that it can cope easily with 3 or 4 days of beard growth which no other electric shaver that I've used has managed to achieve. It also shaves incredibly close and smooth and the results feel like I've shaved with a razor, especially when used on the wet-shave setting with shaving gel. The wet-shaving setting simply locks the head in place so that it feels more like a razor.As I would expect, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It has four cutting mechanisms, two outside foils and two central, more complex blades which seem to be able to cut sideways. So it's not just up and down movement as with a normal foil shaver, it works fine used as if it's a rotary shaver. I'm not sure how the other blades work but they certainly make a difference and all problem hairs, such as those around the jawline, are cut with ease.It comes with a docking station that's a bit more than the norm, - it not only charges the shaver but is loaded with an alcohol cleaner and has a cleaning cycle that is activated by pressing the start button on the front. This does a good job of cleaning and freshening up the blades though doesn't empty the shaver, that still has to be done manually. This will add to its running costs and I'm not sure if I'll purchase any more cleaning fluid. It isn't necessary to use the docking station to charge as the lead can be plugged directly into the shaver.Another positive is that the battery lasts a very long time. I've used it for a month, nearly every day, and only had to charge it once. I've unplugged the docking station every time it has finished cleaning so I could see how long the battery would last. There is an indicator with shows battery level as a number of bars. Another shaver I have estimates remaining shaving time which is something I would prefer to see.It also comes with a nice, solid travel case that will protect it nicely when thrown into a bag or suitcase.There are only a couple of negatives in addition to the extra cost of the cleaning fluid. It looks much better in pictures than it feels in the hand. I was expecting, at the price, for it to be metal, but it's case is a shiny plastic. It also vibrates quite powerfully, so much so that I find it a bit tiring to use, but that is only a minor niggle.Would I buy it at this price? Absolutely not, so perhaps I shouldn't give it 5 stars. Although it's an impressive shaver, it still doesn't beat wet-shaving with a razor for me. But it's certainly the best electric shaver I have ever used and will be my new number 2 shaving solution.",5
1267,I think it's a great little gadget,5
1268,"I use 2 of the biggest sizes of these together to block out a 3m bedroom window. As a nurse working night shifts these are a lifesaver! Absolutely recommend over a blackout roller blind or curtain. Always stays stuck, blocks all around the edges and you can still have the window open for a bit of circulation. Even my sleep deprived brain can get these up and ready to use in a couple of minutes. Fantastic.",5
1269,"I use this black our curtain for shift working, it is of a very durable material and does black out our bedroom window leaving the room in cave-like darkness. Very happy with this item, I could have done with a bigger size if I were to purchase this item again, so make sure you measure the window properly.",5
1270,"I used this for the first time this week, and I'm pleased to say it does work.  Sometimes the suckers didn't 't stick too well, so I cleaned the windows and they stuck better.  It 's a great thing to take away on holiday, which is what we did, the curtains in self catering places seem to be very thin and they let the morning light in. This blind is great!",5
1271,"I usually read the most critical reviews first to find out the products weak points -- as I have a rather worn series 7 was wondering whether to replace it or ""upgrade"" to series 9 - some reviews gave cause for concern (series 7 vs series 9)The shaver was exactly as described in the ""blurb"" -- usual Braun high quality.It was claimed by one reviewer the cleaning station was a lesser quality than previous models --- NOT SO, different design but as far as I can see the quality is the same going back over the past 18 years? ---  this is my third shaver with a cleaning station.Some reviewers thought the shaver could only be recharged via the cleaning station --- NOT SO, as with all other models the power cable can be connected directly to the shaverIt is claimed the cleaning cartridges are expensive - TRUE - BUT not as expensive as some make out - if one uses the cleaning station with  the shaving head full of beard stubble the cartridge will not last as long -- clean the head with the cleaning brush to remove most of the ""stubble/debris before using the cleaning station ------- I am not sure but I think there is a sensor that can tell how much contamination is in the cartridge –---- those that remove the cartridge to save on its use defeat the purpose of its cleaning and LUBRICATION process. ( reduces the life of the head and quality of the shave.)The travel pouch is the best looking yet BUT it should have a space for the brush as with the old 7 series --- one needs to clean the shaver when on holiday/business trip.I decided to purchase the 9 series  and will do a head to head with the 7 series as an update on this review later",5
1272,"I was a bit reluctant to buy this as I’d had the original design with my eldest 8 years ago and it wasn’t great at sticking on to the window. This one is much better, the design has also been changed from stretchy elatic to make it smaller to Velcro which makes it stay flat on the window. Pleased I gave it another try",5
1273,I was a tad nervous about fitting this to my car air vents as cheaper ones in the past have broken off and I have been left with the fitting stuck in my vents :( This was not the case for this - I can easily fit and remove this mount in less than a minute. With saying that it doesn't mean that it falls out easily either.....I have used this whilst driving through fields and over hills etc and my phone was never not secure. Its great when using your phone as a sat nav/google maps etc quickly glance at the screen for instructions without putting yourself or other road users at risk.Another useful use is you can use this in the house to hold the phone when watching a film or looking at pictures - pretty cool feature.Overall great product,4
1274,"I was concerned this blackout blind would fall off in the night, as it is held on with suction stickers, but it holds firm. Folds top to bottom, side to side, on to Velcro to fit most window sizes. Looks a bit of a eyesore but keeps the light out and is portable.",5
1275,"I was expecting them to be smaller and not quality looking for that price, quite the opposite they are stunning. Look very nice and certainly dont look like they cost under £10. Arrived well pakaged and in a little box.",5
1276,"I was hesitant/reluctant to endorse more screen-time for our daughter, because we harbour such positive relationships with books and had seen some worrying addictive traits when she was exposed to YouTube. But with research, found that the Fire HD gave us sufficient control to govern what she was able to do.I have to say, it's an incredible well considered and thought-through offering. The fact that I was able to configure the device to have hours of activation (so she can't use it outside of hours we control) and time-restrictions (either ""total usage"" or ""usage by activity"") is invaluable. It means that we can limit the time she spends watching videos, which has been helpful.The best thing has been then catalogue of applications; as she has organically found enjoyment in maths games and puzzles, far more than we expected, and it's been a rewarding (and important) part of her continued education.As with all things, governance and moderation are important, but it's so rewarding (as a geek myself) to see her embracing the fun behind educational games, lateral thinking and problem solving. Where a parent would (rightly) have concerns about allowing a child to have full access to an iPad, I wouldn't have the same worries here. The parental controls are well considered enough to be useful but simple enough to be accessible, it's a device I cannot recommend higher.Well made, high quality and robust. If you're uncertain about whether it's right to allow your child to have a tablet, this would be the perfect purchase for you. It's as open or as restricted as you want it to be, and as a parent that's a very reassuring level of control to have.",5
1277,I was initially put off by all the negative reviews but decided to give this blind a try anyway.  I think there must have been a bad batch because I have had no issues with mine. I bought this for my toddlers room and it's helped massively.Pros:blocks out the sun wellKeeps heat out leaving my sons room much cooler so he can sleep at nightFairly easy to put upSticks well- I put it up about a month ago and it's stayed up since thenEasy to take downVery portableCons:If you have double glazing it will trap the heat in the window (like its literally boiling!) so we opened the window to let it cool as i seen some reviews saying their window cracked,5
1278,I was pleasantly surprised how very well this worked: I didn't want something that would attach to the windscreen and this is a great alternative. It fits and holds well. It holds my phone very well and is unobtrusive. Highly reccomend,5
1279,"I was pleased to hear that I was going to receive the new Braun shaver free from Braun as I had always wanted to try a foil shaver after using a Rotary blade for many years.The shaver turned up nicely packaged in the box was the shaver, a cleaning station and a travel case.  I was eager to give it a go but there was no charge on delivery, but  it only took a short time to fully charge.The shaver its self was a nice weight and has a very good grip feel.The first shave, I had about a day and half of growth and the shaver coped very well I managed to get a close clean shaven look in a couple of minutes. I have quite sensitive skin and the shave did not cause any irritation at all. I did not need to go over the same area to many times unlike other shavers I have used.Once I had finished shaving I docked my shaver in the charging/cleaning station and set it to work. First impressions of the station is that it is a bit on the big size and does take a bit of bathroom shelf space. The process takes a few minutes squirts it with Alcohol spins it up and then eventually you can hear a fan drying it.Travel I was away for the week and took the shaver which I used every day without having to recharge and it is still sitting on max bars. The case and shaver are a nice shape and is not bulky when packing a small case.The Actual shave I feel is a lot closer than my last rotary shaver and the next day I have a lot less growth than I use to have, it gives a great shave.I have also checked out the refills for the cleaning station and these are not overly expensiveOverall I think this is a great product and wish I had switched from my old regular shaver sooner.",5
1280,"I was running out of options on getting our 14 month old to sleep past 5.15am. This blackout blind is brilliant! We have huge windows and it fits perfectly (with room to spare), lots of suckers, it has ever lost its grip or fallen. Very very pleased. And even better we can take it everywhere we go to spend a night! Excellent product.",5
1281,"I was slightly worried about buying this because of all the negative reviews with the suckers but I have no regrets. I have used it on our daughters bedroom window at home and also this week in a caravan without any issues. I like the velcro for different sized windows it means it can fit all sizes and minimises gaps. No issues with the suckers at all and she now sleeps for longer in the morning, hurrah!",5
1282,I was surprised at this phone holder to be honest . Well worth the money,5
1283,I was unsure whether to get this as had car holders previously but weren't very good. However I read the reviews and decided to purchase. And I have to say for something so simple it is perfect for what I needed. I have an iPhone 6s Plus and this holds my phone perfects with a good grip. Also it is really easy to attach to the vent in the car. Would definitely recommend,5
1284,I was very scared to put blinds in my children's room due to several accidents in the media causing death over cords. I am so delighted with this product.it has suction cups to stick it up by. No dangerous cords etc and it blacks out the kids bedroom. Thank you. A marvelous thing to have,5
1285,"I was very sceptical about purchasing this at first as I have always wet shaved.  So far I have not been disappointed with this.  I find it cuts very well and that you do not need to press on the skin to hard to achieve the close shave.IMPORTANT NOTE: One thing I will point out is that I purchased this with an offer of a facial solution by (Lab Series), it is important to note that this model states not to use shaving solutions even though it's a wet/dry shaver.  Bear that in mind.",5
1286,I was very surprised of how good it was. the screen was very good quality and my daughter seems to love it. She is also very good at navigating through and finding some very good games that have even caught my interest!,5
1287,"I was worried about buying this because other reviews claimed kids couldn't use certain apps like Disney life etc but all I had to do was download them to the adult profile and in settings add them to my sons profile which took literally a minute. Worth every penny my son loves it and he's no longer stealing my phone! The case is sturdy, easy for children to use, brilliant apps, great battery life and if he breaks it they will keep replacing it for 2 years! Fantastic highly recommend!",5
1288,"I wasn't sure about buying this but thought I would come in useful for our holidays. I'm so pleased I got it, not only was it perfect for holidays but I've also used it on my 5 year olds window at home, he was constantly getting up on a night complaining it was too light in his room, we've all had a much better sleep since having this up. It's a bit of a hassle to put up but once up it can stay there for days",5
1289,"I wish I had bought this 4 months ago,  it would have saved hours if not days of my life! I bought a Tommie Tippie electric breastpump before I gave birth, not knowing that I would have to express all the time. The other night it took me an hour (!) to get all the milk out so I knew something has to change! Wow, this pump is sooo much better,  quieter,  lighter,  more effective, quicker and I think it's made of a better quality plastic. The TT pump kept falling apart while in use. Very happy with this product,  you can get it cheaper elsewhere if you look around :)",5
1290,I wish we had more stars. Fantastic product. Daughter loves it. Amazing. Ordered another one for our other daughter,5
1291,I wont go over the things this shaver does as braun do it better than I could but this shaver is top of the line and catches every hair in one stroke and you cant do better than that.It has a solid build and is comfortable in hand during use .I found it easy to clean and quick to charge with a good amount of shaves from one charge,5
1292,"I work night shifts occasionally. I used to be able to sleep without closing curtains during the day. As I get older, I need darkness to sleep in the daytime. This does the trick. I've not used the rubber suckers and I've put more velcro up at the window after a while as the provided velcro comes off after a while. Been using for a long time now. My Niece has borrowed one too to help her sleep in darkness.It wouldnt be any use in a photographic darkroom as there are one or two pin-pricks of light that do come through, but not enough to make a difference to me.",5
1293,"I would recommend this product to anyone who works shifts, wish I'd bought it years ago, just slept following first night shift since purchase, 7 hrs solid sleep!Really easy to install, suckers work really well, easy to put on and take off, really easy to adjust, yes it lets in a small amount of light at fold but not enough to make any difference, and you could always add some extra Velcro to correct this.Honestly shift workers, buy it now!",5
1294,I wouldnt be able to sleep without it :),5
1295,"I'm a fan of electric shavers as wet shaves, as nice as they feel afterwards, always give me a bad shaving rash.  Over the years I've tried Remington, Braun and Philishave shavers, and Braun have always been the ones that seem to have worked best for me, and my current shaver - a Braun 8995 - has served me well for the last six or seven years.First impressions of the 9040s are a little mixed.  As another reviewer has mentioned, the box immediately rattles when you pick it up, and once opened you see that it contains the shaver itself, a zip-up case, a charging cable, and a tiny brush and phial of light machine oil, both of which are loose in the box and the source of the rattle.  I was a little surprised that these weren't ""held"" in the box somehow, but ultimately once you've emptied the box you're not likely to keep the cardboard container.The shaver has a pleasant heft to it and feels nice in the hand.  The head is huge - when trimming the hairs below my nose I tend to tilt the shaver on one side and use one of the four cutting foils to do the job - but shaving is easy, and a little quieter than my 8995.  There are only a couple of buttons on the shaver.  A circular on / off button which, when held for three seconds, also toggles a ""travel lock"" so that the shaver won't take a knock in your luggage and switch itself on.  There is a slider just above this, which allows you to let the foils tilt to follow the curves of your face, or you can lock them in one of five angles.  On the rear there is a pop-up sideburn trimmer.  On the front of the shaver a series of blue bars lights up to indicate  the charge level.  The shaver comes with a spiralled cable complete with a standard two-pin plug at the end, so to charge the device you'll need a shaver adaptor or a bathroom with a shaver plug perhaps by the mirror as you find in some hotels.  The instruction manual advises the owner to charge the shaver for an hour or so before the first use, and once the device is fully charged the blue ""bars"" go out.  Note that as this is a wet and dry shaver you cannot use the shaver while the cable is plugged in, for safety reasons - as soon as the cable is inserted into the bottom of the device it turns off, so you can only use it cordless.This is a wet and dry shaver so you can use it dry as with all other electric shavers, or with foam or gel, and it is apparently waterproof to a depth of five metres!  I've used it both wet and dry and personally it seems to shave the same in both modes.  If you use it wet, or choose to clean the shaver by holding it under a running tap, the instructions say that you need to apply a drop of light machine oil - the supplied phial - once a week.  I think I'll stick to using it dry myself.Cleaning the shaver is simple.  Press two buttons, one on each side of the head, and the top section of the head comes away.  You then tap the cutter section on a hard surface, such as the inside of a wash basin, and brush any bits out of the inside of the shaver using the supplied brush.  You can also clean it under a running tap, as I mentioned previously.  Unlike the 8995 the entire mechanism is contained in the part that pops off, and the shaver body simply has four ""fingers"" that waggle back and forth, driving the gizmos inside the head.  This means that when you choose to change the foils - advised as an every 18 months process according to the instructions - you'll simply pop the old foils off and click the new ones on, instead of removing the foils and then pulling the serrated blade away separately as with the 8995.  Replacement blades are available online and in stores and seem to cost about the same as for the 8995, maybe a little more.  Personally I change the blades on my electric shavers once a year as I use mine at least once a day, and when you weigh up the cost per shave it's negligible.The shave quality is excellent with the 9040s.  I often go for Turkish wet shaves when I have my hair cut and the shave from this seems comparable, and lasts longer than my previous electric shavers before I start to feel rough bits.  Yes, sometimes you have to go over areas repeatedly to catch all of the bits, but this is common to all electric shavers I've ever used, and also for wet shaves.  It also seems to do the job more quickly than my previous shavers, missing fewer hairs and cutting closer first time around.The travel pouch is big enough to hold the shaver and nothing more.  Another reviewer has complained that the cable doesn't fit inside the case but I don't see this as an issue.  An old shaver of mine had a case which also held the cable and as a result the case was bulky, which was a pain when I was going away for a night and wanted to fit everything into a small piece of luggage.  With this I can just throw the shaver into my case, and push the cable into a convenient gap somewhere, and that's that.  The case is rigid and made of an ABS-like material, almost like stiff rucksack fabric, and zips up along the two short ends and one long side, so it doesn't need a long space to be available when opened.  It looks good actually.Now for the niggles, and they're minor.  The aforementioned case doesn't have a recess for the cleaning brush, so if you put the shaver and brush into the case the brush will fall out as soon as you open it.  If you own a cleaning station for a previous Braun shaver the size of the head of the 9040s probably means that you won't be able to use it anymore - it certainly won't fit into the station for my 8995.  I do slightly miss the LCD display from my 8995 too, which provided a reading of how many minutes of shave time the battery had left (more accurate than bars!) and also told me when the device needed a really good clean.All in all though these niggles are minor.  This is a brilliant shaver, and if you're a fan of Braun electrics I heartily recommend it.",5
1296,"I'm quite a recent convert to electric shavers and have tried a few in the last couple of years.  There are two main kinds of shavers, foil (like this Braun) and rotary which Philips tend to manufacturer.  I have always found that rotary shavers don't really suit me and regardless of how little stubble I have on my face they tend to pull, snag and leave me covered in rashes and grazes. Foil shavers are a different kettle of fish however and suit my face and skin down to the ground.The 9095CC really does seem to be the ultimate in foil shavers if you tend to judge things by their price tag.  However, in this case the price really does seem to be worth it.  On receiving the Braun, I charged it for 30 minutes or so and then shaved off three days of stubble without the slightest pull or tag and without any rashes at all.  The shave was amazing.  Still not really comparable to a wet shave for me, but pretty damn close.The head can swivel with the contours of your face or, if you wish, you can fix it into a certain position.  I did try this but it seemed pretty pointless as I then had to angle the shaver to get a close shave, which made holding the shaver uncomfortable.The shaver itself really looks the business; sturdy and reassuringly weighty.  The materials used seem really good quality and everything from the aforementioned swivel head to the LED power indicator makes you realise you are using something pretty special.The accessories are also worth mentioning too; you get a leather carry case, a small brush and a combined charger/cleaning devices that is fairly large.  To be honest, I don't think I will be using this to either charge or clean the shaver.  I think I'll just use hot water and the normal supplied two-pin lead to charge when I need to.  Full charge should maybe last you a week depending on how long you shave for each morning.  I've used it for three mornings so far and I still plenty more battery power left.If you can afford it then this really is a brilliant shaver and comes highly recommended.",5
1297,I'm so pleased with the blackout curtain. It is easy to use and does a perfect job at keeping the light out of my daughter's room. The sucker are strong and there is no risk of the curtain falling off the window. I plan to take this with me on holiday too.,5
1298,"I'm very very happy with the shaver. My skin is very sensitive and when I was using top range Philips shaver I had many burns, spots and cuts even I was shaving once a week. Finally I said enough and there was a good deal on Amazon I pulled the trigger. No more cuts, my skin looks so healthy after every shave that finally I liked shaving.The cleaning station is a nice gadget but easily you can clean it under running water. The fluid provided gives nice lemon scent.If you buy this product you won't be disappointed.",5

1300,"I've always wanted to drive a super-car, if only to see if it really is worth 4 or 5 times the cost of my standard family car. It doesn't look like I'll ever get that chance but I have had the opportunity to test-drive this Braun Series 9 cordless shaver, which costs at least 4 times what I would begrudgingly pay for a shaver - so is it worth it and how does it fare after a full week's use?After an initial full charge (until the 5 bars showed on the handle) I turned it on and immediately felt the amazing power of this shaver - it's not mains driven but still felt like a bag of very angry bees in your hand as it oscillates umpteen times a minute. It certainly tackled my weekend stubble without breaking a sweat AND I honestly had the best shave ever, comparable to using foam and a wet blade razor.I was put off foil razors (as opposed to rotary cutting ones) a few years ago when the foil broke during use and caused a nasty cut to my face so I was a little nervous with this double foiled head. I need not have worried, it felt smooth and sturdy and the smoothly floating head really did follows the contours of my slightly too angular face. You can optionally set the head to a fixed position but I have not felt the need to do this.Thankfully this also has a built-in sideburn trimmer, something my current razor does not have and involves swapping heads around, so this is a huge time-saver and a massive benefit to me.It's fully waterproof, so you can use it in the shower if you're so inclined (didn't try that) and you can use shaving foam too, something I do about once a week to get a really close, clean shave - not that I really needed it with this super, close-shaving razor but I tried it anyway and it felt good and gave an excellent result.Being fully waterproof you can't use it with the charging cable attached but even a 5-minute charge gives you more than enough for a shave. Not that you will ever forget to charge it as it has 5 very obvious LED bars on the handle showing charge level and it beeps if it is getting flat too, just so you remember. It charges fully in an hour, they say, but after a week it has only just gone down to 4-bars so I can't verify this (yet).Is it worth the price? Is a Rolls Royce 'worth the price'? It's a superb shaver, that's for sure. The best I have ever used in my many decades of shaving. I would personally never buy something this expensive but having had this review sample I can say if you do splash out (or get it as a gift) you will be amazed at the performance.So I can only laud its quality, give it 5-stars for pure performance and let you decide (or your loved one) whether you want to spend this amount - if you do you'll never go back to a cheap razor, that's for sure.Now all I need is for someone to give me that Supercar to test drive...",5
1301,"I've been using a Spiderpodium in my car for a while, and it's been able to adapt to each - increasingly large - phone I've stuffed into it.I'm currently using an iPhone 6s Plus, and the spider has gotten a little wobbly lately.It took a few attempts at getting the mount lodged firmly in the air vent (I drive a Ford Focus, and the vents have never been particularly mount friendly), but after I figured out that there are different spacings between the rubber prongs I got a good firm mount set up. The real test was whether the grip was firm enough to hold the iPhone 6s Plus - not a particularly light phone, especially as mine is in a case - without it slipping out while driving.Happily, the mount passed with flying colours. It'll happily hold the 6s Plus firmly, and I've been able to twist the mount around and use the phone in landscape view. The mechanism for gripping the phone seems to be robust, and reminds me of the Joby camera mount I picked up a while back. I tested the phone with my wife's iPhone 6, and it coped fine with that too, as you'd expect.I'm going to switch to this instead of the Spiderpodium at this point. It feels more stable, I can position the phone in a more visible location than before, and easily being able to twist the phone around and use landscape is a nice touch.",5
1302,I've bought and returned this shaver before but decided to give it another go and I'm delighted I did. Shaves close either dry or as I prefer it in the shower with Clinique Aloe Vera shave gel. Just a small blob of the shave gel goes a long way and I'm left with a really smooth shave and in my opinion as good as a razor.,5
1303,I've bought this and it's amazing. So much easier than manual pumping and the let down function is great.Also fits with asda little angels bottles too which was an additional bonus as I was going to pump into the bottle provided and transfer to bottle.,5
1304,"I've got this for my old Mini Cooper, I could only use it on the little side vent next to the window due to needed straight vents so be careful of this, however it works great there, doesn't fall off and holds the device well.The product is basic, but achieves what it sets out to. I've given this a 5 star review from using it for about a week now and i'll come back and review it again if I face any problems with it. I think the price range is pretty reasonable while it's on offer.",5
1305,"I've had a fair few car mounts in my time, from the full blown mounts with a suction cup to attach to the window or dash to those that are so small that they can be thrown in a bag or in your pocket without the awkward bulky parts. Of course, the type of car mount that you use is based on your personal preference and needs.The packaging is very clean and gives a glimpse of how small the air vent mount is. Upon opening the box, you're instantly greeted with the car mount that is packed in a semi transparent bag giving it that professional and personal look - an item that has been individually wrapped for each customer.The e-Clip Air Vent mount from MPow is pretty small and compact and is made with robust materials making it a good long term investment. It can be easily moved from one car to another or taken with you wherever you go. The part that fits into the air vent is made from durable rubber which has four prongs in order that it can fit into any air vent without there being any difficulties with compatibility. The rubber is sturdy enough to prevent the mount from falling out of the air vent and pliable enough so that it does not damage the air vent in any way. The mount itself has a spring mechanism that can fit the majority of phones up to 10cm/3.9 inches - enough room to comfortably hold a phone with its case. The mount grip can be placed wherever you want around your phone without causing difficulties with side buttons being pressed inadvertently. The spring mechanism is strong enough to hold your phone in whatever position you want without it falling out. The mount itself gives the flexibility to rotate your phone whichever way that suits you. This is down to the sturdiness of the four rubber prongs.The mount can easily be separated from the rubber section that fits into the air vent with a press of a button and a swift slide to the right (if in landscape orientation with the MPow logo facing the correct way). This provides the convenience of changing phones at your discretion without removing the rubber section of the mount from the spot you have chosen.One thing that you should bear in mind is the type of air vent that you use. Despite phones getting lighter and lighter these days, the weight of the phone can cause the air vent to move downwards which can affect your view of the phone. Most air vents are fairly rigid so this won't really be much of a problem but if the air vents in your car can be easily manipulated, i.e. they're very loose, then you'll have to take this into consideration when thinking about buying any air vent car mounts.Overall, this mount is great and easier to use than others. The main positive point of this air vent mount against the magnetic version is that you can use this mount with or without a case - the magnetic versions require a metal plate to be placed between your phone and the case unless you're prepared to stick the metal plate directly to your phone.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a simple but effective way of mounting their phone whilst in a car.",5
1306,"I've had and used this for a long time now, and I'm very happy with it. It's a good size and to date I have not had a room with a window too large to cover it. I'm sure now having a baby it'll be good for him too!",5
1307,"I've had help here from my usual furry-faced friend.Over the years I have tried several different shavers. I have learnt to avoid them because of the rash I get after using one, especially on my neck. The Braun 9095 is the first shaver that I have used that has not given me a rash and that was without using creams or special lotions. Whilst this shaver will work wet and in a shower, my preferred shaving method is with it dry but immediately after a shower. Using the cleaning station, which comes with the unit, is extremely simple and very effective. It leaves the shaver in an as-new, clean condition with no effort.The shaver comes with a leather covered, zip-up, hard case; an instruction manual, a cleaning station and one container of the special lemon scented, alcohol cleaning fluid for use with the station; a power charging cable which charges the razor or the cleaning station and a little brush for cleaning the pivoting head (but not the foil and cutter cassette).The case will accommodate the shaver only. There is no room for the charger or power cable. It is possible to slot the cleaning brush under the shaver but there is no little pocket to stop the brush falling out when opening the case, so take care not to lose it.The shaver does have a fast charge facility but can also be used whilst plugged into the mains power when in a hurry with a totally flat battery. The cleaning station will charge the shaver after the cleaning process has finished if the shaver is left in the station. The power cable needs a traditional two-pin shaver socket or adapter plug. The cable is not particularly long and so the cleaning station needs to be placed close to a shaver socket. The cleaning station is quite large and needs a shelf at least 10cm (4 inches) deep to stand on.There is a travel lock on the power button. Holding the power button down for three seconds will activate the lock so that any accidental press on the power button will not turn on the shaver. This is good when 'travelling light', to avoid arriving at one's destination with a dead shaver and no power cable. Repeat the process to unlock it.The Braun 9095 is the largest shaver I have ever had. I was surprised at its size. It is not heavy. The shiny metal-looking front of the razor is plastic. The back has a rubberised surface which means it doesn't skid on a slippy tiled surface or in wet hands. There is a pop-up hair trimmer on the back for nipping tenacious hairs. The shiny front part is a fingerprint magnet but easily wipes clean. The shaver look very attractive and impressive. The shaver's head pivots for extra smoothness and comfort but it can also be locked at any of the pivoted positions so the head remains at a fixed angle when reaching more awkward areas to shave.I am delighted with the Braun 9095, especially with the fact that it does not aggravate my neck, even when shaving dry. This is, without doubt, the Rolls Royce of shavers.",5
1308,I've had loads of vent holders and all of them have broken over time apart from this one.Unlike other vent holders this one doesn't have a ball joint which is ideal as ones that do tend to always drop down due to phone weight and heat from the vent.I have a Ford fiesta  (older version) which has those annoying circular vents that move around. And this is perfect for I turn the vent upside down and it grips on without marking nor moves around while driving. So glad I've finally got a solution after buying many other vent phone holders!,5
1309,I've had no problems with sticking this up at the window and it's really effective!,5
1310,"I've had nothing but problems with electric razors but I've finally found one that's 95% as good as a wet shave. It's fast,clean and smooth. Easy to clean,just leave in the dock after cleaning for next shave. I normally shave with a curved handled cut throat razor( I still do from time to time) and this Brauns a nice replacement. DO NOT USE CHEAP VERSIONS OF BRUANS CLEANING FLUID!!! You.ll trash a £300Rrp razor to save a few pounds",5
1311,I've just replaced my old windscreen mounted phone holder with this smaller device and so far I've been really impressed. It holds my S9 firmly in place and you can turn the phone 360 degrees depending what your preference is and it can be secured to the vent using one of the two different sized connections on the back.,5
1312,"I've not used a foil shaver for a while - I didn't get on well with one, so my last couple of electric razors have been rotary ones.  These days I mostly wet-shave with a double-edge safety razor, but I still like to keep an electric razor around for quick and easy trims if I don't want to spend the time for a proper shave, or if my beard has got too long to comfortably wet-shave, so I gave this one a try.I'm very pleasantly surprised - it powers through even long stubble with ease.  I grow fairly thick, wiry stubble, and this goes through easily, even when it's long enough that both wet shaving and my rotary razor would have tugged uncomfortably, and provides a slightly closer shave than the rotary shavers I've been using - obviously it can't quite compete with a proper wet shave with a good blade, but it's close!It's fully waterproof so easy to clean, and can be used to wet-shave - having tried both, I found it more effective when used dry, but that gives a higher risk of irritating your skin.it feels powerful and very solidly-built, and the battery life is excellent - I gave it one full charge when I received it, and I've used it 5 times since then and the battery gauge (five neat bright blue LEDs which light when in use) still shows full.The head pivots nicely in use to keep the head at the right angle effortlessly, with a sliding switch to lock the head in place if you need to - can be handy on trickier parts around your chin etc.The one part I wasn't so impressed with is the slide-up trimmer - it doesn't sit as far away from the shaver head as I'd like, so it's easy to inadvertently catch the main head against your hair whilst trimming sideburns - but it does get the job done well enough, so I don't think it quite warrants deducting a star.A nice sturdy case is included.You'll need to replace the shaver head about once every six months - at the time of writing this review, the Braun Shaver Replacement Part 90s for Series 9 Electric Foil Shavers was priced at £35.99 - which seems expensive, but if you buy one every six months, that's £6 per month running cost averaged out.",5
1313,"I've now used this for almost two weeks - and I think it's great. At first, it didn't seem s different from my old Series 7 but after a few days, it improved for some reason and I'm now getting a closer and faster shave than with the 7 Series, even on my ancient 75 year old face! Looks good and feels good too.",5
1314,"I've reviewed a few shavers over the years and to be honest I've liked most of them. Trying to get my head around the description provided and the price was like catching mist, and even when the box arrived there was no brilliant sales pitch. This is not a cheap shaver - I demand details, more than just a made up techno-thing. Syncro-Sonic... Very technical sounding indeed.The reality is, that this beast (in power, not in size or weight) has immense shaving power. It's ""sonic"" ability literally makes your ears vibrate (not in any harmful way!). This powerful cutting action turns your stubble almost to dust. I get a really close shave (my closest from an electric shaver yet), even around the neck which I usually struggle with, and the hair when cleaned out has been sliced in to tiny particles, far smaller than any shaver I have seen previously. The rapid action is certainly doing it's work.It's comfortable on the skin. I received no rashes or blemishes from switching shavers, even though the last one had a cooling option and this does not. It effortlessly pivots around the contours of your face too, making shaving really easy. The design is top notch.The shaver has a multi-bar display for keeping an eye on charge, however you can charge it when you like due to new and improved battery technology. Easy to clean and comes with a travel case.At full price this is a decent enough shaver, but when on offer - this is an excellent buy. It won't disappoint in any way and will deliver you a brilliant close shave.",5
1315,"I've reviewed several Braun shavers over the years and the 9095CC is without doubt the best of the bunch - and at its price point it should be.It's weightier, feels more solid and the motor that powers the head feels to be more substantial and certainly delivers a substantially close shave.I wasn't impressed with the almost mirror like plastic chrome casing. At the release date, for the RRP I would have expected an actual metal to have been used in the construction and not plastic.I've been using the shaver for five days, both dry and wet (with a shaving foam), and the best shave came with using hot water and a foam (so no surprise there).The clean and renew cartridge is the key to getting long use from the foil and cutting head and I'd advocate doing the cleaning cycle at least once a week for those with light to medium stubble, but if you're one of those who have substantial beard growth on a daily basis the do it every other day.I've noticed that within a week of release the price has been reduced by almost a third - and this is the price point I'm basing this review on. At over £320 the price was just too high and I would be unable to justify such an expense on a shaver. At £220ish, the price of the unit is much more realstic and I'm able to recommend such an expense is a justified one. The shaver really is a fine piece of kit - well constructed and feels good in the hand, and most importantly provides a shave that is noticably better than the less expensive models.So, as a treat for yourself or as a present for a lucky friend or relative, the 9095CC will be a valued and much used addition to any gents grooming collection.  Highly recommended.",5
1316,"I've seen the mixed reviews, but for me is the best electric razor ever....",5
1317,I've tried other MPOW products before so I know I can expect a good product each time and they have delivered the goods again. The phone holder nicely accommodates my Xperia phone which I wasn't sure about as its a very tall phone and can easily be adjusted for just about any size. Firm grip and easily mounted though it was confusing to fit at first as I'd never fitted one before. Would recommend any MPOW products and this is no exception. Good buy,5
1318,"I've tried quite a few electric razors through the year but this really is the business.  Has a lovely heavy weight about it which feels great in the hand (as light ones I find tend to make you a little more hamfisted and likely to make errors in my opinion).  This gives an incredibly close shave, far better than some of the tri-rotary types I've tried from alternative brands like Philips (which although contour to the face, tend to catch hairs or miss them completely).The charge lasted fairly well, I'd say since owning it, it's probably been used about six times and it still has a bit of charge in it which isn't too bad in comparison to the last model I used which needed charging every two days.The sideburn trimmer is a great feature and very easy to use without too much fiddling about.All in all, I'm very impressed by this razor.  The price is high, but this has a rather sturdy lasting power feel about it that I could see this enduring through quite a few years of constant use.  Sometimes you get what you pay for in this life, and with this you pay for the rolls Royce of shavers.",5
1319,"I've used many shavers but never had Braun. Had the other spin one but not this. All I can say is that I wish I bought this years ago. I no longer have skin irritation as it more a clear up and down motion. It leaves me with a great smooth finish too.  The clean station is a doddle to use and the shaver always smells fresh when in use after. The pods for cleaning are cheaper as well as u get 3 in a box. Less mess too as you place the cartridge in underneath and then remove when it tells you.The shaver however is great. I don't use the trimmer but if the shaver is anything to go but I don't see the trimmer being an issue.I use the shaver went and dry and love that I can shave in the shower or bath. Dead easy to use. You can also use the shaver lathered up, with soap or just nothing. I've tried them all and no issues.Well done brain for creating a easy to use product.",5
1320,"I've used various electric shavers,over the years. Finally, I've decided that its Braun for me,and the 9 9095CC fits the bill, for me!",5
1321,"I’d be lost without this! I bought a 2nd one to have one in each bedroom, they work so well.",5
1322,"I’m really impressed with the tablet content. My 6 year old loves it! Loads of books, apps and videos to keep him entertained and he’s much more inclined to practise his reading and number skills! I had some initial problems with the set up as I’d done everything but couldn’t see any content. After messing about with it for ages I finally contacted Amazon and they talked me through it. Turned out I’d done everything right, it just didn’t have the latest software so that was a bit of a pain but once sorted I’m very impressed.",5
1323,I’ve had my phone holder a while and am very pleased with it. It fits my Touran vent well and holds my phone conveniently and securely when using it for sat nav. I have bought this second one for a friend.,5
1324,"I’ve reviewed a couple of electric shavers in my time, the one I favoured being a Philips Power Touch 3 rotating head shaver which in my opinion beat the worthy competition from a Braun series 3 . But compared to both those shavers this is a different kettle of fish.You’re getting the shaver, charger/washer unit, cable, storage/travel case, brush and a cartridge of cleaning solution.The shaver itself looks fantastic, very sleek with quite a minimalist look and nicely weighted. When you switch it on it almost sounds like an angry wasp but when the motor is running there is minimal vibration in the unit compared to the Braun series 3 shaver I have. It really is a very, very nice shaver.When I got the shaver it was dead, absolutely no residual charge so I put it in the charger – 1 hour later it was good to go so it’s  fast to charge, according to the manual you should get around 50 minutes of shaving time from a full charge.So I’m ready to shave, before starting I had about four days growth, so longish stubble really - I held off a day or so knowing this was on its way.The shaving head itself should be set to move freely for general shaving but can be locked in one of five positions to aid access to places that are trickier to shave.  So with the head set to free movement I started. Simply put this is the best electric shaver I have ever tried, it seemed no effort at all to get a great shave and by great shave I would say as close as a wet shave as to make no difference, really unbelievably smooth even my wife noticed by sight alone. On top of that it took much less time than the other two electrics, the Philips I use the most takes easily twice the time, same with the series 3 Braun. I was honestly amazed as I never thought an electric could get this close and do such a great job so quickly. The long hair trimmer works great too, it has a slight curve which helps get hairs that bit better around the neck area than a flat edged one would. Fantastic.Now I suppose I shouldn’t expect any less as this is a seriously expensive shaver. Keeping it in top condition may come at a cost also.Cleaning the shaver you can use regular water but the using the cleaning unit for a more thorough clean is probably the way to go and if you have spent this much then you’ll want to keep it in good condition. So you will need to fit the cleaning cartridge to the base unit. The unit/shaver will analyse which of the cleaning programs will be performed - from a short clean, a normal clean or a high intensive clean. After one shave the shaver itself was displaying the icon on the handle for the short clean, when I put it in the base unit it responded with the same info. Now according to the manual each cleaning cartridge should last 3 weeks if shaving every day, now I don’t have dark hair or get a five o’clock shadow so I probably shave every 2-3 days (yeah scruffy beggar!) so with that logic I might get away with a cartridge every 6 – 9 weeks, not bad. Cartridges are £12.99 for 3 (or around that) so I’d be spending about £13 every 6 months say …  but if you shave on a daily basis then you’ll be spending the same every 9 weeks.The shaving head Braun recommends changing every 18 months, again the series 9 head is quite expensive in itself retailing between £35 - £40.So such great shaving does come at a price and that money sure would buy a lot of wet shavers…but also a lot of shaving rashes and occasional nicks from them too.But I think if you are willing to pay this for a shaver then the above probably won’t concern you too much and I really think taking care of something like this is worth the money. Absolutely brilliant shaver, I think I can retire my trusty Philips one and the old Braun Series 3 can continue to rest.",5
1325,"ideal for the caravan to keep it nice and dark, good quality and working well thank you",5

1330,"If you are a parent of a small baby, and you want them to nap during the day, but one of these!!!! Haven't stopped recommending it to all of our friends! We're even considering one for our bedroom. Probably works really well for people with hangovers too- maybe a cross market promotion to students?!?! Joking aside, it's an awesome item, really blacks out the bedroom, and allows our little one a much better chance of falling asleep (the parenting holy grail)",5
1331,"If you had a new born or young child that is affected by the light his is amazing. Does what you want and easy to put and great to take away with you  to enough your little bundle of joy stays asleep, something that ours like not to do!",5

1333,"If you're in rented property like me and can't put a full blind up this is perfect. I've had no issue with it falling off at all, and it can be made bigger and smaller using the velcro. A great purchase!",5
1334,"If your debating wether or not this is a good purchase compared to other brands. Let me tell you, it certainly is. So glad I decided to get this for my daughter instead of an iPad, the 2 years warranty pushed me to get one, but it is so much better in every way. Unlimited content for 1 year is fab, lots of apps for children of all ages. I have a book shelf full of children’s book, yet this tablet has thousands so comes in handy for that too. You can download videos to watch offline. The children’s portal means you are In full control of what your child is accessing. Overall you would be silly not to purchase this for your child.",5

1343,It does as it should. Thanks,5
1344,It does block out sunlight except for some light escaping from the sides. I even cut it into two to cover two windows as mine are only 140cm. Very good indeed.,5
1345,It does exactly as its meant too. My son was waking up when it started getting light now he sleeps till 7am most days. Which means i get a couple of extra hours sleep. One happy mummy.,5

1383,Just as you see in the picture - is very durable - one thing I would say is check where your vents are before purchasing as mine are not situated in an ideal place so it's tricky to see my phone properly - my fault rather than the product !,5

1406,Keeps our grandson happy and occupied. Very sturdy machine.,5
1407,Keeps the children off my phone.,5
1408,Keeps the light out really well. Can be annoying sometimes as the poppers come of the window and it falls down.,5
1409,Kept my boy entertained during a long journey to Legoland from Scotland!,5
1410,kept out the sun on the long summer days (til 10 om here!),5
1411,Kids adore,5
1412,Kids curtains are thin and barely block the sun in the summer. These do a great job. Also great for taking away since they pack neatly into a bag that they come with.,5
1413,Kids love it,5
1414,"Kids love it! Great that everything to download is included (unlike other tablets). Even after the free period is over, will still be good value",5
1415,Kids love them,5
1416,Kids love them and easy to use but Could do with more help to download other than looking on line.,5
1417,"Kids love them, excellent",5
1418,Kids sleep longer with these light mornings,5
1419,Lansinoh are the top make in my eyes for all your breast feeding needs.. This is a simple but strong pump.. Highly Recommended,5
1420,"Large enough format to fit our child's room which has a very big window. Effectively blocks out most of the light even duing the summer months when it does get very bright in early evening. Fast delivery, no problem.",5
1421,Larger screen and longer battery life the only obvious differences to the 7. Worth the upgrade for the battery life.,5
1422,Life safer if you want a pitch black room for the little one anywhere you go!,5
1423,Life saver. Effectively blocks the sun so my little one can sleep that bit longer in the mornings. Easy to put up. Great that I can take it to grandparents & aunties house without any issue.,5
1424,Lifesaver,5
1425,lifesaver for the summer months! easy to put up and take down and a handy little bag to store in for taking on holiday etc,5
1426,"Light, folds away easily and simple to put it. Effective at blocking the light.",5
1427,"Lighter and quieter than my old seven series, more comfortable to hold when shaving, trimmer is much improved and slides out from the back rather the flipping out from the front. Shaving experience is slightly quicker and feels better but some of this maybe because the foil is new?",5
1428,"Like everything else from the Gro company, good quality and works. More pricy than other options but you get what you pay for. Make sure your window is clean or it won't stick up.",5
1429,"Like others I would rate the Braun 9095cc as the best electric shaver I have tried. It just beats my Braun series 7 which I thought was good.The clean and renew does entail extra expense but it is, to me, reassuring that the shaver is as clean as can be. Before putting the shaver in the clean and renew I always take the shaving foil off the razor and tap out ant bits and give it a quick brush. The user guide suggests that the clean and renew cartridges are replaced every 3 weeks if used daily.Rather than take the clean and renew with you when travelling I have found the shaver will last for over 14 days between charges. Just clean the head manually until you get home. Manual cleaning instructions are supplied.One reason that the razor lasts so long between charging is that shaving with the 9095cc is quite quick.  With some razors you may need to go over and over the same parts of your face to get a decent shave resulting in sore skin and maybe razor burn. With the 9095cc there is less need to  go over the same areas for a good shave and so not only  is it quicker but is also a much more comfortable shave.This model, the 9095cc, can be used wet or dry in the shower or bath, but it should not be used with foams or gels. It is only the 9040s that can be used with foam or gel.It is recommended that the foil cassette is replaced after approx 18 months and the price seems to be about £34. Add to this the cleaning cartridges for an approximate monthly cost.Other nifty features are a sideburn trimmer, a status display, a travel lock and a MultiHeadLock switch for hard to reach areas. You can also use the razor as a corded model if the battery is depleted.All topped off with a two year guarantee.",5
1430,Little boy loves it but I am finding it hard to navigate Bd use to its full potential.,4
1431,Little girl aged 4 loves it and very pleased with her Christmas present!,5
1432,Look quality. Very happy with the purchase.,5
1433,Looking forward to be using it more and more. The parental controls are better than alot of other tablets i have seen. My son loves it.,5
1434,"Looks a bit fiddly and worth planning where to put in folds to get best window fit. Once done, it works very well, and keeps out 95% of light.Ideal for babies and adults. Sky/stars design good for youngsters",5
1435,Looks amazing,5
1436,"Looks amazing, haven't try it yet though but looks promising!",5
1437,Looks and works great,5
1438,Looks good what we we seen so far. Its all ready for a 8 year old grandson  on x.mass day,5

1441,Love it,5
1442,"Love it, just what I needed.I use it for a small bedroom to block out the light/ glare when im on the computer and is super.Good price, great quality and fast delivery.",5
1443,"Love it, perfect to create blackout curtains, keeping out light and also heat from shining in the window",5
1444,Love it! Best present for my little one,5
1445,"Love it! Fits both my Iphone 7 and my Galaxy S7 edge WITH a pop socket on it!Can attach to any vent configuration, so will take this with me when I travel as it will fit any rental car.Locks well on to my air vent, swivel head makes positioning a breeze, and it doesn't fall down!",5
1446,"Love it! Perfect for my 3 year old and when he’s in bed perfect for Mummy to use too! Such a reasonable price. Only downside is the movies that are available in the package, there aren’t many choices unless I can’t find them. And the prime movies can only be added to child screen if purchased- but of a fault as loads are free with prime. That needs looking into but love it anyway!",5
1447,Love it! specially the fact that you can use it with shaving foam. Glides perfectly and comfortably. Love the product!,5
1448,Love it. Easy to transport. Does block out the light well. Very pleased.,5
1449,"Love it.I have alternated between wet shaving and electric razors for years. The main reasons are the closeness of the shave, the faffing about and the damage to the face.What does that mean?Closeness of the shave.Wet shaves tend to get very close and smooth. Electric razors not as smooth.Faffing about.Wet shaves you have to use foams etc. Electric razors tend to need two passes if you have too much stubble. So first with the trimmers to get down to a lower level and then onto the main part to do the shave proper.Damage to the face.Wet shaves use blades and there is always the risk with cuts, especially in corners. If you have too much stubble you can get into a wrestle trying to get the thing off your face when it gets caught. Electric razors can be just as brutal if the hairs are too long. Not so much bleeding as plenty of pain and grimacing in preparation for the pain.So how did the Braun 9040 perform?Closeness of shave: Very close, better than any electric used since about the 1980s.Faffing about: With a lot of stubble, only needed to do one pass. OK it was a fair amount of work, but it was my fault for looking like a hippy in the first place.Damage to the face: None. Went straight into the deep stubble without anything being pulled.Overall, a very good shaver which performs ideally. If you travel a lot like I do, this can be charged for the week and off you go.",5
1450,Love itIt could be slightly wider,4
1451,"Love Love Love.  Whats not to like about these earrings.  Great product,, Great price.",5
1452,Love our black out blind. Great for use at home or when away.,5
1453,Love them,5
1454,Love them but smaller than I expected.,4
1455,love them so dainty . would definitely recommend.,5
1456,"Love them, very good value and I am going to be purchasing more for Christmas gifts",5
1457,Love them!,5
1458,Love them!!! My kids think it’s dark and time for  bed at 7.30pm when it’s summer!!!,5
1459,love these,5
1460,"Love these blinds, are better than roller blinds and a permanent fixture in our kids rooms, keeps the room dark in the summer which helps them ( and us) get a bit more sleep!",5
1461,"Love these earrings, really pretty.",5
1462,Love these!,5
1463,Love these. Got my 4 & 2 year old one. Downloaded some films and away they go. Like if that I can simply switch to my amazon account. Full of apps and books and small films that they love!,5
1464,"Love this ... nursery is now in perfect darkness so baby has gone from waking at 5am to sleeping until 8am, getting a full 12hrs which is suitable for her age (and great for tired parents!) ... just wish i’d bought it sooner!",5
1465,Love this as it gets my kids to sleep. Brilliant,5
1466,Love this little gadget. Certainly one of my best buys of 2016! It fits the cars vents and my phone perfectly. I used it for navigation.,5
1467,"Love this product, have been using a manual pump but switched to this and wish I'd done it sooner! So easy to use and takes the hassle out of expressing! Just might take a few goes to see which speed to have it on to suit your milk flow.",5
1468,Love this product. It's so simple to add your phone. You just click it in.  I now have two of these one in each car.,5
1469,Love this product. We take it whenever we stay away from home. So nice to know you can effectively black out whatever room the baby is going to sleep in without it being a huge task.,5
1470,Love this so much we bought another one. We use it during the summer to keep the early light of dawn at bay. Great for kids rooms and helping them to sleep.Depending on the shape of your windows you might get a thin light outline where the sun is not blocked.,5
1471,"Love this tablet almost as much as the kids do, had this since Christmas and can’t count the amount it’s been dropped and still perfect, keeps the little ones very happy love that you can restrict how long they use it for and age appropriate things only! Was planning on buying iPads for the children so glad I chose these a big thumbs up all around especially as they are a fraction of the price of an iPad and certainly more robust!",5
1472,"Love this tablet for my little fella's , can control what they see online and not have to worry about them accessing stuff they shouldn't.  Best tablet for young kids bar far",5
1473,"Love this, it’s the longest lasting in car mount of ever had well worth the money",5
1474,"Love this! Definitely my best buy for my 2 year old! Loads of game apps, kids tv and easy for him to work. The case is great and the 2 year garentee takes the worry away!Used everyday and has really helped teach colours, shapes, puzzles etc",5
1475,Love this! Its great how its adjustable for any window. Will be buying another,5
1476,"Love this.  We had an ipad for our daughter before but this is far better for her.  She has unlimited access to age appropriate apps, videos and books for a reasonable monthly subscription.  I can set when it turns on and off. She doesn't need a code to unlock her profile and in-app purchases are automatically blocked.  Also until she's used a certain amount of educational apps (if we chose to use this function) only educational apps, videos and books can be accesses - usually she doesn't notice as the non-educational apps and videos just don't show up on the screen.  If she does notice and I want her to be able to access more I just enter a code and over-ride the setting.Its very user friendly and would highly recommend.",5
1477,Love this...,5
1478,LOVE.  THIS.  Very easy to adjust the size and put up.  Just need to be firm with the suction pads.  The design is cute and the material feels long wearing.  Used it on holiday first and now it stays in the nursery window as LO likes the dark for napping.  Considering getting one for our own room as well.,5
1479,Loved by my grandson,5
1480,lovely,5
1481,lovely and sparkly,5

1492,Lovely earrings.,5
1493,Lovely earrings.  Nice and sparkly and not too big,5
1494,"Lovely earrings. Can't fault them for the price. Only shame is the box they come in let's them down. It is a cardboard black box which would never be used to hold jewellery of any value. For the price though, one can't complain!",5
1495,lovely easy holder,5
1496,Lovely high quality !!!,5
1497,Lovely item,5
1498,Lovely just what it said on the tin exactly as described really pleased with them,5

1511,Made a 5 year old girl very happy.,5
1512,Made a hugh difference to night sleep. Would recommend. Easy to use must make sure window is clean though before sticking as otherwise will keep falling off.,5
1513,"Made of strong plastic and not flimsy at all, fits perfectly in my Citroen DS3",5
1514,Magnificent piece of kit.,5
1515,Mainly for games and phonics,5
1516,"Many reviews state they look nothing like the picture, but I have to totally disagree. They are exactly how the picture looks. Yes, they are smaller than you might think but they are beautifully delicate and brighten up any outfit or hairdo. They simply sparkle. The price is a steel and I love them.",5
1517,Marvellous product!,5
1518,Marvelous!!,5
1519,Me and my children think this is a great tablet. Easy to make profiles and swap between. Just had to buy another as everyone wants a go. I would recommend,5
1520,Me lady loves em,5
1521,"meets every expectation possible!! nice shaver, really good for sensitive skin",5
1522,"Most vent mounts just fall off after a day or two. This stays snug and won't move, it's perfect for the job10/10 would recommend",5
1523,"Mr Mad Saint Uden (because I'm a lady don't you know?!) assures me this is the best electric shaver he has owned (he's in his 40's).  He's had a few different styles, blade materials and price points.  However generally he prefers the end result of a wet shave with a 'manual' razor.  The first problem he usually gets is 'pull' which he said he was waiting for with this - but it didn't happen.  This makes for a comfortable if unexpected shave.  The next issue he normally has is 'missed bits' ..this one did miss just two spots on the first shave which impressed him, he said it can usually take a few weeks/a month for a new shaver to bed in to the contours of his face and stop missing so many bits...by his third shave with this he was no longer missing.  Next is closeness.  I can attest to the fact that once he has used this Braun series 9 I do not get stubble rash in any sensitive areas ;)  Smooth as a babies bottom indeed :)The cleaning system is fun as it washes and blow dries!  The charge holds well and it is comfortable in his hand.",5
1524,"Mr RomanClodia prefers a 'proper' shave with a wet razor but in the morning rush settles for an electric shaver - after holding on to an ancient Braun series 3, this series 9 has come as a revelation to him. It cut through stubble smoothly, with no dragging, and with speed and efficiency - and gave a brilliantly close shave, practically indistinguishable from a razor.In comparison with the 9055cc model which he's also tried this is cheaper and slightly less of a premium package: the shaver is sleek black with the same cutting technology but without the cleaning docking station, and the travel pouch isn't leather. If what you're interested in, though, is the shaver itself, then this will save you some cash and perform just as well.",5
1525,Mu granddaughter loves it.,5
1526,"Much better than the magnetic ones. As long as you have a vent to fix it, this does the job.",5
1527,Much bigger than expected. Super value for money. And very easy to use...anywhere. Great!!,5
1528,My 2 year old grandson loves it.  Kept him very occupied on our 4.5hr recent holiday flight,5
1529,My 2 year old loves it,5
1530,My 2 year old toddler loves it. He plays some of the games on it and watches netflix (animations and cartoons).Drawback - if you don't have wifi then most of the games don't work but you can download films / shows on Netflix if you are travelling somewhere far.,5
1531,"My 3 year old granddaughter absolutely loves it. Its a nice size for her and the case makes it much easier for her to hold without accidentally changing the screen. The picture quality, responsiveness and speed are excellent. I'm going to continue with the The Fire for Kids Unlimited subscription when the free trial runs out, its well worth the money.",5
1532,"My 3 year old grandson loves this with lots of things to do to improve eye, finger control, memory testers, puzzles & so much more. Grandson calls it his 'Pi Pad'",5
1533,My 3 year old is very happy with this. All apps installed are for kids with no ads! and it is impossible for my son to reach content I do not want him to see.,5
1534,my 3 year old loves his so so much.,5
1535,My 3 year old loves it x and it’s great she can only go on things set for her age x,5
1536,My 3 year old son loves it.  It’s easy for him to operate.  Also easy for me to manage the use of it in order to safeguard him.,5
1537,"My 3 year old won’t put it down! Parent controls and apps, videos etc are great. Would recommend",5
1538,My 3year old loves this. The kids software makes it the perfect purchase. Full of games and puzzles.,5
1539,My 4 year old daughter loves this. Easy to set up and use.,5
1540,"My 4 year old grand daughter loves the kids edition,  and the kids unlimited, only negative point is that the case around the tablet, does not have a stand or info about how you can stand the tablet.",5
1541,"My 4 year old son loves it , as he enjoys practicing phonics and playing games",5
1542,My 4yr old had this for her birthday and loves it. She is finding it easy to use and moving between the games/video/apps easily. Great value for money.,5
1543,My 5 year old daughter loves it and was immediately at home with it. As she has learned to read and been taught sims she has used book and number apps on Kindle. She does miss some of the things on Kids Tube though. Very good how you can limit time which she has accepted.,5
1544,"My 5 year old daughter loves this! She had it for Christmas as it was on a special deal complete with the case.Its easy to use and set up. Great for long journeys. She loves the camera and the video side of it as well as all the other things she can watch, play and learn on. Very robust and under guarantee for two years.I thoroughly recommend it.",5
1545,My 5 year old granddaughter absolutely loved it this is her second one she had the 7inch before,5
1546,My 5 year old loves it. Replacing a cheaper but similar tablet. This one seems faster and is certainly better quality. It has more games on it thanks to the Amazon kids subscription and comes with the 2 year guarantee for accidents so pleased with our purchase so far. Only issue is the storage seems to be used up immediately with the games. Had to go through and delete some but may have to buy a card to supplement storage.,5
1547,my 5 year old loves this tablet and watches #DANTDM on it regular. thanks Amazon!,5
1548,My 6 year old granddaughter loves it Best Xmas present ever!,5
1549,My 7 year old absolutely loves this. I'm so glad I went for this option as it has taken all of the worry about what she can access away. I would highly recommend.,5
1550,"My 7 year old son loves this and uses it for a variety of things. I found it pretty easy to set up for him and love being able to set times / duration that it is able to be used. It would be useful if there were also something like a 'notebook' section where he can write things down;  the 'notes' app on an iPad. Also a bag specifically designed for the 8"" with the protective kids cover and charger to fit in. It would take the hassle out of shopping around for something to keep it in and just having to go with a 'best fit'. However, overall we're very happy and I have managed to claim back my iPad him!",5
1551,"My 8 year old daughter loves the content included with the kids subscription.  Very happy with functionality of the FireHD, fast, crisp colours and easy to use.",5
1552,My 8 yr old loves it.,5
1553,My almost 5 year old is hooked! There is an abundance of games pre-set in to the tablet saving on irritation/complications through having to download what are commonly just 'demo/taster' games from an App store. He thinks it's an Ipad :)Very robust so perfect for clumsy hands. Would suit younger children too through ease of use and a variety of games to suit different ages. My 9 year old and partner of 38 also enjoy to have a play so provides great entertainment for the whole family.Only minor gripe is it takes a good 2/3 hours to charge. Can be remedied by buying a fast charger however.,5
1554,My baby sleeps though in the bright sunshine! Great if you need some darkness!,5
1555,"my bedroom faces the setting sun and in the summer the light keeps me awake, not only does it cut out all light it is also thermal and keeps the room cool, easy to fit, suckers work well, very happy have bought two and will buy another one for when I go on holiday.",5
1556,My child loves it and I love how easy the parental controls are,5
1557,My child loves this and the casing is a god send xx,5
1558,My children love it!! Great I can see what they are downloading game wise and also set them certain times when they can do learning first and then play time.,5
1559,"My children wake up at dawn everyday meaning I'm exhausted they get tired and stressed daily, we've tried lined curtains, towels etc and you can still see daylight.This blind is fab it creates actual darkness! And until you remove it the room stays dark, easy suction cups to attach to window and never had a problem with them coming off, a must buy for any parents!",5
1560,My daughter absolutely love it. Good buy. Great size.,5
1561,My daughter adores this. So much for her to do and it’s really solid. We’ve got a few little scratches on the screen but nothing serious and not surprising. I want one myself!,5
1562,"My daughter is 3 and it is perfect for her, she loves it and play games and watches YouTube videos",5
1563,My daughter is a very light sleeper. Her sleep pattern was great during the winter but I found she would wake earlier and earlier as the summer approached and not take her naps as easily either. The blackout blind has helped immensely. It comes with a handly little bag. Sometimes the suction cups don't stay but all you need to do is give the glass a quick clean and breath on the suction cup which usually fixes the problem.,5
1564,My daughter is delighted with this pump and uses it daily.,5
1565,"My daughter loves all the games,apps and has not stopped playing with thisGreat buy for any kidd",5
1566,My daughter loves it,5
1567,My daughter loves it but did manage to somehow crack the screen.  Amazon were really good though and replaced it and gave me good and clear instructions of how to return the broken device.,5
1568,"My daughter loves it, battery life last well, and nice and easy to set up",5
1569,My daughter loves it. Absolutely a great buy. Love parental controls. Well done Amazon! :-),5
1570,My daughter loves it. There are loads of great games and videos. Highly recommended for young kids.,5
1571,"My daughter loves it. touch screen is a bit slow/stiff, other than that, it's all good",5
1572,My daughter recommended it after lots of various ways to try blackouts these are fantastic and can be transported anywhere. Mine are in Tenerife at present!!,5
1573,My daughter who is 3 loves this and there were battles between her my 9 year old son so we bought him one too.  My son has delayed development and rarely plays educational games but he does on his kindle! Very good value for money,5
1574,My favorite shaver. As good as the others I've had over the years.,5
1575,My first electric shaver and i really liked it.Cut hair good.,5
1576,my friend loved this due to living in italy,5
1577,my girls love them amazon you are very clever with what you have come up with here it doubles as a normal tablet too only thing I would say is bad is how long it takes to load up my laptop loads quicker but other than that they are amazing especially with the 2 year no worry guarantee if they break it they replace it who would have thought. thanks amazon just an update if you break the tablet they send you a 2nd hand device ''A certified refurbished Amazon Device is a pre-owned device that has been refurbished and tested to look and work like new. The device is then certified and given a new 1-year warranty. Certified refurbished Amazon devices are available at a discount off the regular price of a brand new device'',5
1578,"My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet, especially the extra size.  The guarantee is really genuine too.  The almost year old previous Fire Tablet accidentally had a broken screen after it was dropped.  There was no fuss, just a replacement in time for the extra surprise gift at Christmas.",5
1579,my granddaughter loved it we bought it for a long train journey it kept her occupied,5
1580,My granddaughter loves it and we haven't had any problems so far. Would definitely recommend,5

1582,"My granddaughter said it was the best Xmas present she has had, she is 7 and just loves it for reading, games and lots more",5
1583,"My grandson is totally delighted with this, my daughter is impressed with the level of parental control.

1586,My grandson loves this. Exactly what his parents were looking for.,5
1587,My grandson spends hours with this device a very good learning device,5
1588,My grandson wakes up easily if it is light but this has solved the problem.,5
1589,"My husband has had one after another of Braun's top-of-the-range shavers and he says there is not one that even comes close to this new model in ease of handling, closeness of shaving result (as good as a wet shaver) or ergonomic shape.  As far as he is concerned Braun could not have bettered their latest invention.",5
1590,my husband has one and loved it so much he bought one for others too,5
1591,"My husband has started to use the Braun series 9 9095CC razor  and when I asked  what it was like after his 1st shave , He said it's better than his old one from Philips,and another other razor he has ever used. He said it doesn't leave his face feeling dry. only downside he would of liked a bigger travel pack to fit the plug in aswell for longer trips away from home.",5
1592,"My husband is a renewed man.For years he kept saying that shavers are for older generation only.No more, he used this product once, twice, using it every day and would not go back to razors.",5
1593,My husband loves it.,5
1594,My husband loves this nifty little gadget - just what he needed....,5
1595,My husband was very pleased with his new electric shaver and says it's by far worth the price tag.  He's always found shaving a bit of a chore but the Braun 9040s makes it a quick and easy job with fantastic results! Would recommend.,5
1596,My kids absolutely love their kindles.Has an amazing choice of apps for them and allows me to keep an eye on what they are doing and put time limits. Would definitely recommend,5
1597,my kids are  verry happy!!!,5
1598,"my kids love these, all the included games and videos are great, its nice and light compared to the iPad they had previously used. The case keeps it well protected, my 2-year-old has dropped her numerous times and it just bounces.battery life is decent. The parental controls are great to limit the amount of time per each activity time and set on and off times is great.",5
1599,My kids love this - way more than the iPad mini. Would highly recommend,5
1600,My little (almost 2 year old) kid loves it and the kindle kids videos are absolutely engaging and keep him entertained for hours on end.  Couldn't be more happier with the product.,5

1604,"My little grandson puts me to shame with this !!  He loves it and he's only 2 1/2 !! Perfect for kids and you still have control.

1611,My nieces 1st dangly earrings...absolutely gorgeous!,5
1612,"My partner always has a wet shave (he is not fussy as to which one he uses which is good as he gets whatever is on offer).  Fed up with the mess he leaves in the bath/basin after a shave when I saw this on the Vine Programme I leapt at the chance of getting this for him.To be honest, if I were buying a shaver for my man I probably wouldn't have got him this one.  It seems (to me, a mere woman) to be a lot of money to pay for something that removes your stubble.  That said, his comments having used this one were so positive that if you are a generous lady looking to buy your man the ultimate in shavers then I would say 'go on and do it'!I will write his thoughts shortly; but for someone who has to share a bathroom with him my one quibble is that the charging unit is huge and would not fit on the bathroom shelf.  Thankfully you can charge directly to the shaver so the shaver itself has not been banished to the family bathroom.My partner's thoughts:  I have always used a wet shave but admit that I don't shave everyday because of the mess I make and the hassle I get over this!  (her fault for buying blue shaving foam I think).  I have used this shaver dry (very dubious about doing this but it was fine) and whilst in shower (which I prefer).  I don't think that the cut is quite as clean as when you have a brand new blade and wet shave, but it is not too bad at all. My last electric shaver (yes it had to be plugged in to work) was many years ago and really was not great.  This one is super-duper!  Everything you could want (and more).  It is difficult to fault really.  It has one additional benefit in that my partner won't use it to shave her armpits - win-win really!  Looking forward to taking it on holiday and testing the charge: will post a new note if it does not live up to expectations.",5
1613,"My quality of life has improved because I can pass this to my daughter to use. And this has hands down, the beat parental controls on the market. We’ve lost money through in app purchases when using an iPad with my daughter.",5
1614,"My second purchase. The first one lasted 3 years and still works. I used it in a friend's car in India and he liked it so much that I left it with him. Hence my second purchase. Simply, and does what it says on the Tin",5
1615,My sister inlaw loved them,5
1616,"My son absolutely loves this product, keeps him entertained.",5
1617,my son enjoys it.,5
1618,"My son had this for Christmas, he’s 6. He loves it. It’s very easy to use and has so much they can do with it. Had it when it was on offer, very pleased with our purchase.",5
1619,"My son is happy with the product. He use's itFor internet and apps, for now.",5
1620,my son loves it,5
1621,My son loves it and he always using it.,5
1622,My son loves it and kids profile very easy to use.,5
1623,My son loves it he's 2 and this keeps him quiet for a hour a night at least,5
1624,my son loves it really happy with it he has special needs but it has everything he likes on it and is easy to use.,5
1625,My son loves it. Pleased went for the HD model excellent.,5
1626,my son loves this. would recommend spending the extra money for the larger screen and more memory,5
1627,"My son refuses/unable to go to sleep if it is still light in his bedroom (not a problem in winter, but in summer it is with the long days). We bought this nearly 6 weeks ago after many weeks of difficult bedtimes and very early morning rises (5am). This been has been one of the best purchases we have made to correct a problem that was slowly getting worse. My son has returned to going to bed at 7pm and waking at 7am like clockwork.",5
1628,"My wife convinced me to buy these (one each for boy and girl) instead of the regular adult set up fire. OK so the adult one is cheaper, but the case alone is probably worth the extra considering how good it is.... it's foam, but still robust and is shaped really well so it's easy for the children to hold, makes the whole thing much more kid friendly.The ability to set up different user accounts, where kids don't need to tap in a security passcode but adults do, is fantastic.. it works so well. Use as an adult profile and it's exactly the same as the standard fire HD 8. Switch to kids and you can tailor to suit age or education needs.As for content, we've set up accounts for each child that is age specific so content is tailored, including educational apps... it's simply brilliant and my children love it.If you have children, below teenage years, and are looking for a tablet for them then look no further.Down sides: camera is a bit basic, but perfectly adequate for kids. Screen resolution isn't the best out there, but again is perfectly adequate.Up sides: too many to mention, especially at this price, the whole thing just suits our needs perfectly... well done amazon.",5
1629,Neat and strong enough t hold my phone despite the shaking it gets in the van. Well worth the money,5
1630,"Neat little phone holder,grips my s7 edge well and turns sideways when i use sat nav.Also the fixings to the car vents feels very secure.",5
1631,"needed 2 as windows are extremely large, but by turning 2nd blind 180deg. fitted perfectly.Turned day into darkest night, no cutting needed, brill. great price.",5
1632,"Needed a blackout blind for my bedroom to convince my 4 month old to have his daytime naps in his cot. only wanted a temp one as he will be moving into his brother's room in a couple of months. This was just right. Sticks well, adjusts to the size of the window, and blocks out all the light. Couldn't ask for more! A bit dear maybe for a temporary blind (it does say in the instructions temp use only), but otherwise perfect.",5
1633,"Never have the time to write product reviews for all the things we buy on Amazon but I had to for this one, it's AMAZING! We're using it in our 2 year olds bedroom to block out early morning sunshine and it stopped his 5am waking the first day we used it! Bought another one for another bedroom already and can't recommend it enough, easy to use, straightforward and simple but amazing results!",5
1634,"Newly purchased but seems well made, fit Subaru Forester, and BMW e92 3 series.  Hard to see how rubber mount could scratch anything as other reviewers have claimed.  Clamp detaches from base using button, but is secure.  Very pleased is my initial review.  We'll see how it stands up over time.",5
1635,Next day delivery easy to put up room is now dark  been up for two days. Only thing I will say I had a problem with one of the pads sticking I just USD a bit of olive oil job done.  my 2 year old daughter is no longer getting up at 430am about 630 now and that's fine!,5
1636,nice,5
1637,Nice and big sticks to the windows easily does a good job of blocking the light. Very fast delivery would definitely recommend.,5
1638,Nice and compact.  Holds the phone firmly.,5
1639,"Nice and easy to set up and use. Like the parental control features. It replaces two tablets that have gone wrong in the last few months so hopefully it will last longer, at least we will have the two year guarentee to fall back on should it not last.",5
1640,Nice and sparkling 😊,5
1641,Nice earrings,5
1642,Nice one good prise my kids love it,5
1643,"Nice quality. It works, stickers not always in the perfect place, as all windows are different, but has enough material to work effectively.",5
1644,"Nice, lovely pattern. Blacks out but, lets in light at top if gap appears, which is fine.",5
1645,"no used it yet as its a Christmas present but it looks good, it has been set  up ready which was easy",5
1646,"Not only great for the kids when we go away or stay with grandparents, but brilliant for getting sleep as a shift worker in the summer months! Only snag is getting it back in the bag but can't fault it.",5
1647,Not perfect but I'm giving it 5 stars for value for money. It's half the price of the medela (not on Amazon) and almost as good. It's fairly efficient and not too noisy. It also works well with Mam bottles. My baby struggled to take a bottle and the test that worked best in the end came with this pump too!,5
1648,Not that secure but does the job,5
1649,"Nothing special, just what it says on the tin. Fits various phone lengths and holds them in place well enough.",5
1650,Now bought two of these for the kids rooms. Easy to put up (just need a small lick on the sucker pad and a clean window) and reasonably adjustable. Bit of a bind to put up and down every day so we just leave them in place. Tried all sorts of blinds and curtains in the past and this provides by far the best level of blackout. Live in the far North of Scotland so some sort of light reduction is essential in the summer months. No issues whatsoever with the quality and unlike some others we've had no problems with the suckers coming unstuck (leave them up for months at a time before guilt forces me to take them down for a spot of window cleaning). Happy.,5
1651,Now I don’t worry what my son is watching. Best kid gadget so far,5
1652,"Of all the razors I have tried , this is the best one that I have had the opportunity to use. My beard is fairly heavy and grows in different directions on my neck, and in the past, this has accounted in missed hairs and cuts from the products I have used until I got to the point where I put off shaving as long as possible every week or two. When I receivedBraun Series 9  , I could not have imagined a better result. I no longer get nicks and cuts and missed hairs growing in different directions, and my skin feels as smooth as after a spa treatment every time I shave with no discomfort at all. I can appreciate that every person has a different hair growth and needs for a clean shave than mine are, but from my experience, I would be very comfortable recommending this product to anyone with moderate to heavy hair growth. Also, the charging and clean-up couldn't be easier. I can recommend this razor without reservation .",5
1653,"Of the many electric shavers used over my adult life, the first two were of the foil type and previously only two were Braun; later it was mainly rotary shavers that had been purchased, initially on recommendation. More recently, a Braun Series 7 model was bought on the basis of its supposed efficiency and to replace a failing and ageing rotary but its results were very unsatisfactory and was returned. A Braun Series 3 obtained recently has proven to be mostly satisfactory although relatively inexpensive, but it does not use the same type of cleaning system just a brush.The Braun Series 9 9095CC Wet/Dry Electric Shaver is the most advanced and prestigious model of the current range. It also features an adjustable head to provide the optimum shaving angle and position. It is the only one that is Wet and Dry-usable and features the Clean and Renew Charger base that serves not only to recharge the shaver as required but also to clean and lubricate it by passing an alcohol-based fluid through and over its cutters and associated components. A similar type of base and cartridge are common to several models from Series 5, 7 and 9, past and present although not all. A cartridge should be replaced at most every 3 months but possibly sooner should you use the shaver more often, but about 2 months of use should be expected. There is a warning indicator when the cartridge needs to be replaced. If bought in 3- or 4-packs, a year's supply of the cartridges may add £20 or so to its annual running costs.A semi-hard shell case is included but obviously only for the shaver which it protects very well. As the sole method of recharging the shaver is from its base, there is no need for the case to provide space for a mains lead or adapter, although other models in the range may need such accessories.The shaver was supplied with the battery fully discharged and it needed a full one-hour charge time to provide around 50-minutes of use, about enough for around 2-3 weeks if each takes around the typical three minutes. After a few cycles, the charging times may be slightly less. This should cover most business trips, holidays etc without needing to take the charger base - the cleaning cartridges may not be allowed on aircraft and you may need a backup shaver if the trip is to be extended as there is no possibility to use the shaver via mains power.The charging/cleaning base will need a substantial shelf or bathroom cabinet for storage and use and it will need to be within reach of a power socket. The base is fairly large and you may need to store spare cartridges, the multi-packs also fairly bulky. The shaver is itself quite large and heavy, which speaks rather well of its construction. Charging is by surface contact alone with the shaver relying on its weight and gravity to maintain a connection; if the shelf is not level, the connection may be unreliable.Braun claim the shaver to be waterproof, but only for 5 minutes under running water, which is sufficient for daily use. It should be noted that some very inexpensive shavers claim 100% waterproofing and Braun should be able to better match that, especially at the model's typical retail pricing. The base does not isolate its cleaning and charging functions and they strat together; when the cleaning cycle ends, recharging continues if necessary.Braun also claim to have improved the shaving efficiency with redesigned cutters and blades. Without prior experience with other Series 9 models, any perceived benefits cannot be confirmed. The shaver is more effective than the results obtained from the Series 7 model previously owned but still not outstanding as far as personal needs or expectations are concerned - no other shaver currently or previously owned produces results individually or consistently considered as perfect. Parts of my beard grow in different directions and can thus defy a rotary shaver unless the direction in which it is moved is reversed as the cutters rotate in a single direction. A foil shaver operates side-to-side and should better cope with different growth directions, plus it may be used diagonally or vertically where necessary.The shaver may not suit everyone or their beards and it may also exceed personal budgets. However, if you want to use the best foil shaver currently in existence, then this is certainly it. The shaver feels reassuringly solid and comfortable in the hand, something that cannot be said for many low-priced products. A minor issue is that it provides only about 50 minutes of use per charge which may be restricting under some circumstances.",5
1654,Ok but does tend to slip down / cone off easily,2
1655,Omg thank you so much so quick and lovely packed .,5
1656,on these light morning it is fab i have a very active 22 month old and it play time as soon as its light.it keeps her room dark for a longer,5
1657,One of the best electric shavers. It shaves so smooth and sharp as a close to a 5 blame Gilette shavers,5
1658,"One of the best purchases for our baby's bedroom. We already have a blackout blinds, however there are still gaps. We needed a solution to this issue, and for our upcoming holiday. This does the job so simple and easy.If you live where there is sunshine and have a baby then this is a must have purchase.",5
1659,One of the easiest to use phone mounts. I love the placement isn't up on my dashboard or windscreen.,5
1660,"one size fits all, great product",5
1661,"Only had it for a couple of days but so far so good. I needed to get the phone in a holder rather than the glove box, and this looked like it was going to be compact,  unintrusive, sturdy, easy to install, and I was right it is all of those things. It also holds an IPhone 6S in a leather case folded open well. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and for a great price with next day delivery on prime.",5
1662,Only used once so far for visit of grandchildren. But worked perfectly as described. No problem with suckers on the window,5
1663,"Ordered this because my 6 year old was waking with the sun and being exhausted for school.It works brilliantly. No issues putting it up- i didn't even bother cleaning the window- sticks great, to remove, use the small pull tab on the sucker- to avoid any damage to your window.My child now sleeps better and wakes at a normal hour.Comes with a carry bag for transport too.Very useful.",5
1664,our 5yr old loves it,5
1665,"Our baby was born in February so he was becoming more aware of the difference between night and day as summer approached. We purchased this for his room and it made the world of difference. It really does block out the light, delaying his wake up time significantly.  The sticky pads and Velcro parts make it easy to change size and didn't detract from preventing the light from entering. The little bag it comes in makes it easy to travel and we have taken it on holiday with us.",5
1666,Our curtains are thin so I put this up on my little girls window to block out the summer sun. Makes a huge difference and keeps room cool.,5
1667,Our daughter loves this as a travel companion!,5
1668,our grandkids love it.,5
1669,Our kids bedroom always ends up with bright sunshine in the window up until late in the evening even tho we have a thick curtain on it all ready so got this to reduce the light a bit and wow its reduced it to pitch black and its so easy to put up with the suckers and the valcro is a great idea to reduce the width or height. Recommended to all.,5
1670,Our kids love it,5
1671,"Our midwife recommended this product as it works well with MAM bottles. It's so easy to assemble, turn on and function. One of the best things I've done is buy this.",5
1672,"Over the past few years I have tried several electric shavers and feel like I have been on a quest to find the ideal one for my tough whiskers - Braun Series 3 to start, then the Series 7, which I was generally very pleased with although noisy, and then I splashed out on a Philips 3D Senso Touch which was a revelation - until they changed the design of the shaver head and things went backwards, a huge disappointment after shelling out a big sum on what I though was the holy grail. It was therefore with some trepidation that I took the plunge a few days ago and went back to Braun - this time the top of the range Series 9. In short I am delighted after my first shave today on a 2 day growth. It's a very close shave, effortless, over and done with in no time and much quieter than my old Series 7. If you have any concerns over spending this much on a shaver, don't hesitate, it's worth every penny.",5
1673,"Over the years I have owned a number of different electric shavers including many Braun models. I think that this one is their best yet, and certainly the best I have used. It gives the closest shave I have ever achieved with an electric razor. I use the clean cycle only after 2 indicator lights have lit and this seems to be quite economical with cleaning fluid usage. I haven't dared to check the price of a replacement head yet (every 18 months is recommended) but I will be happy to pay to keep up this performance. I am glad that after some hesitation I 'lashed out' and treated myself to this model.",5
1674,"Over the years I have tried many electric shavers, but none of them has given me as clean a shave as using a wet razor and cream.  This one, however, comes closer than anything else I've used by a long chalk. The rotating head means that you can really shave under the chin line and other awkward areas properly and closely.  I have used it both wet and dry and find that using it wet gives the best results for me.  But I do not use  gel or cream, but rather simply wet the face, or maybe add a little shaving oil to my face,  and keep cleaning the heads under a running tap regularly whilst shaving.The razor comes with a neat carrying case, a cleaning brush, some lubricating oil for the heads and razor itself, plus a simple but effective charging lead than ends in the standard two-pin plug.This is not the cheapest of electric razors but I guess you get what you pay for here, as in most things, and I would certainly recommend this for those wanting an electric razor that really shaves you smooth!",5
1675,"Overall, my dad has super sensitive skin that rashes at the hint of a razor let alone an electric but this has not irritated him AT all even with daily use, I've never seen my dad happily shaving and he adores this so that is testimony enough to its gentle yet powerful claims.He's been testing this out for nearly 4 weeks pretty much daily and is converted even if there was a short sharp intake of breath at the price.Pros: quick shave with no 'catches', comfortable grip even for lefties and an ergonomic design so that switches are not obscured by grip, lightning fast charge, dry and wet options- dry is really good but wet is superior, cleaning system is superb and easy to use with no fiddling about and last a decent amount of time.Cons: locked into brand for cleaning system capsules, doesn't include lubricating oil as a result, cleaning station is pretty noisy, instructions manual was a bit lacking as dad had to YouTube a demo on wet shavings no information was included other than that you can do it. It is pretty expensive.I inherited my sensitive skin from my dad, he hates shaving but likes a clean face so has been dealing with razor burn and irritation for years after a very sore experience with a 1990s top of the line electric shaver. This shaver promised to be gentle yet replicate a wet shave, so we took the plunge.My dad is like me in that he has tried all the possibilities of the razor before giving feedback, dry shave, wet shave, dry shave with preshave products and wet shave with different mediums (gel,cream,shaving soap etc) and overall he is really impressed with not only the results but the ease and speed of use and fact his skin hasn't looked this good in years thanks to no irritation whatsoever.As a dry shave it's perfect for day to day, a really close shave on the face but a few (and it is being pedantic) not as close patches on the neck even when stretching the skin but this can be forgiven as dad says it is really quick and much safer than using a razor at 5am!The wet shave with gel is about as close as you will get to using a proper razor even on the neck and the gel cleansed easily from the head under running water.He also tried it on my brother who hates shaving and had about 5 days worth of growth, on a dry shave it was easily mown away to a very smooth result and there was no snagging and ripping out of hairs as my brother has experienced before when left it too long on a far cheaper electric.Overall the razor is near perfect in my dads opinion, the only 2 points he has issue with are the cleaning system tie-ins and the overall price.The cleaning system now he finds a fantastic thing, he can shave quickly and chuck it in to clean and not be fussing around, however initially he was reluctant as you are tied into a cleaning and lubricating capsule that has to be replaced every 6-8 weeks depending on usage and average price ranging between £12.99- £15 for three or four depending on where you buy is an additional cost when it can be cleaned and oiled manually.  However, the ease of use is a big persuader and the sanitary aspects means my brother or husband could borrow it without concern.It is also very noisy so my dad couldn't leave it in their bedroom as leaving it to clean at 5am would definitely wake up my mum.Price wise it is a HUGE investment with ongoing capsule costs, my dad would never have bought this if we hadn't been offered to review due to his history with electric razors and irritation when generally shaving, however, he does say it is a fantastic machine that has made a massive impact on his skin and eased his early morning routines that I don't think my dad will pick up his wet razor again until this has run its life.I think for the benefits to his daily life and it is within your budget that's definitely worth the initial outlay, so if you can afford it and are hesitating I and my dad would say buy it!",5
1676,Part of a package where I must have saved £hundreds,5
1677,"Partial review by my husband is as follows:""When all you want is a nice smooth clean face after a shave this one does it, it does it with ease, you end up with a shave which is really close and surprised me. Genuine surprise, I'd never felt my face so smooth, devoid of hairs. However... IT'S LOUD!!!! I mean really loud, the ulta sonic buzz when it's placed against your chin makes you go deaf to all around you, you just can't hear over the noise. When it's away from your chin it's still loud, made my wife ask, ""What's that noise?"" on a few occasions, but it's now my favourite shaver. Don't want a new one, think I've found my shaver of choice. I'd rate this 5 out of 5 despite the noise it's that good.""Yes, I agree, this shaver is one of the loudest my husband has ever used, but I was impressed that he did not have any areas of stubble, which he has tended to still have with other shavers. But this seems to have really gone with the contours of his face and given a really clean smooth cut.The shaver itself is very stylish and robust, however, that said he did manage to pop the top off a couple of times, as it fell off the side, but didn't break anything, thankfully and the top just clicked back into place.It is a one speed shaver and you just press the power button on and away you go.Has a pop out smaller beard trimmer or moustache trimmer if you don't want a full shave.Comes with a cable for charging, not a stand charger, and is a two pin plug, so you need a three pin adapter for UK sockets (not supplied).",5

Some people seem to have trouble with the suckers, but I slightly dampened ours and it stayed up a full seven night holiday in the room we had our toddler in. Not the best for smaller windows I guess, but fine for moderately narrow ones. I tried it on a sky light once and it didn't really work, but that was a bit of an ask anyway :-) Ended up taping that up with newspaper in desperation lol.",5

1742,"Pricy, but the best electric shaver I have used. The cleaning unit keeps the shaver in top form & only costs me app £ 3.50 a month for cleaning cartridges.",4
1743,"Probably the best £20 I've spent this year.  I can't get up in winter and I can't get to sleep in the summer, my whole body clock is governed by daylight.  Banged this onto the window, behind our slatted blind and instants darkness pervades.  Perfect.  If you want a dark room, buy this.  Just a note, a couple of the suction cups had their edges curled over...not a drama, if your rub them between warm fingers, they soon flatten out...just in case this happens to you...don't panic! little bit of moisture (spit!) goes a long way to making them stick too :o)",5
1744,Product and delivery both excellent,5

1760,Purchased for our 7 year old daughter - fantastic!! The protective cover is excellent - rugged but does not impact use or volume. Parental settings are great as well. Also worth mentioning that there are age choices on set up so that you can tailor the appropriate viewing / use.,5
1761,Purchased for our 9 year old grandaughter who set it up herself and absolutely loves it. It is everything advertised and more - first class.,5
1762,"Purchased this after long deliberations between this and the medela swing. Went for this one as it was somewhat cheaper and I preferred that it was a closed system so didn't need to worry about milk getting into the pump system. Very easy to use, even following some confusion when first putting together - my only criticism is that the pictures in the instruction manual are quite blurry so it took some time to work out which part was what - but it is so simple now I've worked it out! Very easy to clean and sterilise, very comfortable to wear, I manage to express a good amount even using the lowest power setting. You do have to lean forward somewhat to allow the milk to drop into the bottle. I don't find the unit particularly loud, but I don't have a point of reference to compare! Baby had no issues latching to the bottle, and I have subsequently bought spare bottles and teats, and haven't experienced any nipple confusion. I would recommend this.",5
1763,Purchased this for my 7 year old best thing I have got her. Amazing so easy to use.,5
1764,purchased this tablet for my autistic son he loves the kindle fire's we have three for him at the moment as the charge obviously only last so long but they help keep him calm when we are out the home and I am also able to connect the internet to my iPhone hotspot so while im driving he isn't trying to attempt to get out the car as he is being occupied thank you amazon for developing a good reliable and yet safe tablet that I don't need to vet out before leaving my son with the tablet. This has made our life sooo much easier.,5
1765,"Purchased to replace a series 7 that I dropped after 7 years. Great shave, feels good and not at all plastic as I have read in some reviews. A good buy now the newer series 9 is out.",5
1766,"Quality phone holder. I bought one before this which broke after one month. Admittedly the other one was cheaper but it didn't last long. This one however has lasted about a year.IF it breaks or needs replacing, I'd buy from this brand again",5
1767,"Quality product, fits easily, holds phone very securely, unobtrusive when no phone attached.  Was so impressed I bought a second one for out other car",5
1768,"Quality product, well worth the money",5
1769,Quick and easy to put up and it is easy to alter the size using the Velcro pads.  Packs away into a little bags which can be easily transported when visiting people.  I use this every day for my daughters room (in rented accommodation and cannot put up a black out blind) it is well worth the money.,5
1770,Quick delivery and on time. Does what it says on the tin.Close shave and quick charge. Better than the Braun 5 series,5
1771,"Quick delivery, solid and sturdy phone holder. Would recommend.",5
1772,"Quickly an accurate. I'm happy, tks",5
1773,"Quiet, effective and classy. It oozes confidence and goes about its tasks in a very reassuring way. The build quality is good and the results have been better than expected when compared to my previous Series 7.",5

1775,Real live saver,5
1776,Really  nice earrings arrived quickly thank you,5

1778,"Really does make the room very dark, easily transportable",5
1779,Really does the trick as I am a terrible sleeper and up the minute any light peeps in,5
1780,Really easy to use and does not take up much space on the dash board.,5
1781,"Really easy to use and good screen size. Great value for money, I would recommend it.",5
1782,"Really easy to use if you just take your time with the suckers, sticks for a really long time, cuts out the light really well for sleeping in the day after night shifts. Velcro patches are really great for making it fit to smaller windows. Would highly recommend",5
1783,really excellent product when it works but I had to return one of two bought at same time as the second one was completely dead. finding this out when initializing them on Friday afternoon before Christmas was very stressful but customer service were brilliant and I received a replacement the following day. A further issue arose when transferring ownership to granddaughters parents as because there would be no internet at venue of giving presents they were initialized on my account and transfer reset without the one year bonus package. Once again customer service were brilliant in transferring package to granddaughters parents account. BUY without any reservations as any problems very quickly dealt with by customer support,5
1784,"Really fantastic. Granted it takes a moment or two to suss out how to properly stick it to the window, but once it's up it's completely 100% light-blocking. Living in central London this has been a game changer.It actually does fold right back up into the carrying bag (sometimes these things never go back to whence they came) but it does! The velcro system for altering the dimensions is great and doesn't compromise the light blocking-ness.I definitely would recommend, even if the lovely starry pattern might seem a bit childish.",5
1785,Really good,5
1786,"Really good as I work nights sometimes so I need to sleep in the day time, I would say the suction sometimes slips but I just give it a wipe down and re apply and it stays nicely.",5
1787,Really good clips on vent and fits too size of your phone,5
1788,Really good holder for all phone sizes. Adjusts easily,5
1789,"Really good idea, it is a bit of a puzzle on the first use but soon got the hang of it, haven't taken it down , keeps most of the light out, therefore baby sleeps for longer. Does what it says.",5
1790,"Really good mount! Using it to hold an iPhone X in the apple leather case and it holds perfectly without slipping. The parts that grip the phone are like a rubbery/silicone that is soft and very grippy so there is no worry of the phone slipping out. The amount of spring force that 'clamps' the phone into the mount is reassuringly strong. Using it in a mk7 VW Golf, which fits onto the vents without any issues. The part that fits onto the vents is rubber, so there are no worries about it scratching them as I've read that some other mounts do. Works well landscape or portrait, although I prefer landscape so that it 'fits' with the look of the dash a little more.Very, very happy with this product. Highly recommended.",5
1791,Really good product but the suction cups are bit useless. Must do measurements before you buy. We've got gaps in our window but its covers most of the window.Good for those late summer nights when it's still bright.,5
1792,"Really good product, definitely a must for summer. Found a little bit of a pain attaching to a small wondow, but it can be done!",5
1793,"Really good product, suckers are a bit of a pain to keep stuck to the window but room is lovely and dark and had stopped my 2 year old from waking up at crack of dawn.",5
1794,Really good shaver,5
1795,"Really good tablet for the kids, it packs enough punch to move decently most games and the parental control tools are good and easy. I have a 4 year old, and this is what I wanted for him experience the digital stuff and for me to be able to control it.",5
1796,"Really good value for money... had a replacement sent as son placed the tab in the bath... when it was full, no questions asked we had a new one sent by Amazon the next day... excellent service.",5
1797,Really good. Have used in hotels and caravans.As a shift worker i now use it when on nights,5
1798,Really great for kids and adults,5
1799,"Really great, sturdy little phone holder. Preferred this to the offensive, stick on holders that go on the windscreen.",5
1800,Really handy and easy to transfer between cars if needed or take on holiday for a rented car. Would definitely recommend.,5
1801,Really handy portable blind. Plenty of suckers to to the window and they are very strong so doesn't fall down. Great for when you're away or as a tempory blind for your childs room.,5
1802,"Really handy, easy to use and travel with - a must buy!",5
1803,Really handy.,5
1804,"Really happy with this product so far. It is easy to use, and blocks out the light, just as described. Now I get a good nights sleep! It's great value for money.",5
1805,"Really happy with this product, it's really steady and holds to the car vents really well",5
1806,"Really happy with this. Locked down do my son is safe.... was getting to risky on the iPad watching YouTube videos. Can leave him alone now watching age appropriate stuff. I did have to select an older age bracket on set up to get to stuff he wanted and that I found acceptable. Only issue is that it doesn’t have all the iPad apps that he used before but he has enough to be playing with for now. It’s a bit tricky to set up but once done it’s a good piece of kit, battery seems to last forever and the case is indestructible!",5
1807,Really happy witth it!,5
1808,Really happy! Fast delivery!,5
1809,Really impressed with these blinds so bought a second one to use when there are two windows in a room. They are easy to fit and stay up very well.,5
1810,really lovely each pair is better then the one before,5
1811,Really neat idea. The suckers do need to be pushed firmly until you feel a little pop but then they stay up very well.,5
1812,Really nice. Thanks,5
1813,"Really please with my purchase, of the Gro Anywhere Blackout Blind. Item As decribed. Highly recommend this seller.",5
1814,"Really pleased with this device and the wealth of apps, books and video's available on it for my son to use. The chunky casing surrounding the Fire HD8 is easy to hold and the tablet is much lighter than I had expected it to be.  The best thing is the parental controls for controlling the time and content my son can see. It's very easy to configure.  I had looked at the likes of Vtec and LeapPads before I saw the HD8, and my concern with those was the cost of some of the apps and the limitations of the devices. The free subscription to the books/apps/video's for the first year gives a lot of content. I'm a prime member so after this free year, it's only £1.99 a month. When you consider the cost of some of the LeapPad games that come in at £20 to £30, paying just shy of £24 for a year I didn't think was bad.The only slight downside, as some others have reported, is where some apps require an internet connection in order to be used. This however is no different to other tablets and mobiles where certain apps require internet access. I have mitigated this with tethering it to my mobile whilst out and about, as and when required. Some apps do still work offline, those with ticks against them to indicate the app/book is already downloaded. I am also a little disappointed in the camera being such a low mega-pixel one.  When you consider most mobile phones have over 8MP cameras in them and the device only comes with a 2MP front and rear camera, I would have expected more. But, I guess it's one way to keep the costs lower, and really when you think of it, it's my son taking pictures not me, and 2MP is good enough for him. At the end of the day, it's a tablet for playing apps, videos and reading, not a camera!We used to have a Hudl2 before this device which had appalling battering life. I have to say I am very impressed with the battery life with the HD8 though. Some reviews have said there is a very long charge time, but I usually have it charging overnight so the 6 hour charge time is not an issue. To be fair, I don't think it takes as long as that to get to full charge.The peace of mind 2 year warranty also helped make my decision to purchase this device. Knowing that I can send it back, no questions asked for 2 years......it was a no-brainer!Overall, very impressed so far and would highly recommend.",5
1815,really pretty earings..,5
1816,Really pretty earrings great value,5
1817,"Really pretty earrings, nicely boxed for presentation",5
1818,really pretty. Arrived quickly,5
1819,Really sparkly. People though they were real,5
1820,Really struggled to find blinds for my 12 month old sons room. Didn't want to expense of made to measure blinds so got this as a temporary fix and it works amazing. Great for when your on the love or travelling as it fits in to a nice small bag! Does what it says on the bag!,5
1821,"Really subtle phone holder to pop in the grill, holds the iPhone 6+ perfectly. Fab product.",5
1822,Really useful and works very well,5
1823,Really useful.  Use a lot.  great for travelling,5
1824,"Really wasn't expecting that much from this item but I must admit I'm rather impressed. Sticks to window by good quality suckers, then any excess you fold the curtain which sticks to the Velcro tabs next to the suckers, thus forming a pleated curtain affect. Completely blacks out light and has a nice nighttime design on with a storage case. Great for travel. Very high quality, more than I expected. However didn't seem to make a blind (excuse the pun) bit of difference to our nocturnal two year old, so the search goes on for ideas to keep him in bed goes on......",5
1825,Really works and easy to fit on any window. I've got internal beading/lines on my windows and still this sticks well.,5
1826,Really works- great product,5
1827,"Reasonable price, agile and sturdy build quality. I got this phone holder yesterday. Placed my IPhone 6 on it once attached to air-vent and tried to use the phone. Grip was brilliant. I could use the phone with easiness unlike my other cheaper phone holder where I have to hold the phone holder with my one hand and use the phone with my other hand. With it, I can use it with my single hand to dial number or send text or use navigation system etc. Phone can be place safely without scratching. I think this is due to the fact that both ends could be extended unlike in my old one which could be extended from one end alone. It blended well with my dashboard.",5
1828,Received the black out blind for my youngest son's room. He's 9 months and struggles to sleep with the lighter nights. After been refused to put a normal blackout blind up by the landlord I searched for one that didn't need drilling and fixing. Found this and could not be happier. It's made his room pitch black and as his room is south facing this is a god send.,5
1829,"Recommended to a few friends who needed such kind of solution: renting, guests into an odd room... Then I got it myself for the same reason. It has been a faithful curtain for everyday!!! Granted it is not as convenient as having a installed curtain, it is still pretty easy and highly effective. Dumbfounded I was to find out that even my neighbors, who OWN their home, have been using the same curtain! We can sleep because this curtain blocks out all the light.",5
1830,Robust and good quality holder,5
1831,Robust cover works well,5
1832,Saved my sanity while on holiday! Managed to fit to our apartment windows so my girls (2 and 7) slept soundly as they are used to a blackout blind in their room at home. Well worth the money and will be keeping for all future holidays!,5
1833,Saves you from getting up with the sun rise because your toddler is awake. Don't know what I would do with out it,5
1834,"Screen is crystal clear to look at, very child friendly and very easy to use and set up.Daughter loves being able to watch Netflix offline on long car journeys",5
1835,Second one of these that I have purchased and they are brilliant. Fit our iPhone 5s perfectly. Can turn sideways for sat-nav use. Fab!!,5
1836,Seems a leap forward in speed and display compared to the previous one.,5
1837,Seems to be fine.,5
1838,Seems to work but not tested over longer journeys or longevity of grip,5
1839,Seems to work well with my iPhone 7,5
1840,Seems well made and will be much better than the very cheap one I have at the moment!,5
1841,Sent these earrings to a friend for her Birthday and she loves them. They are really good quality and very sparkly. Such a Great Price !,5
1842,"Seriously, where has this been all of my life? My partner and I are nurses and is perfect for shift work and long lie ins required after 4 long days in work :)",5
1843,Shaves extremely close. I have very thick and fast stubble growth and I get at least an extra day between shaves versus my old Philips Sensotouch 2D RQ1195. Paid £150 in the sale but well worth £210 (current price). No irritation and fast shaving time too.,5
1844,Simple and brilliantly effective!,5
1845,Simple and easy to use.,5
1846,Simple and effective.Great value,5
1847,simple but effective for most phones in the car!,5
1848,Simple but very useable piece of kit. Good quality.,5
1849,Simple but works well. Would recommend.,5
1850,Simple design that works for what I believe is all phone sizes.,5
1851,"Simple design, strong and a doddle to fit. So much better than the type that stick to the windscreen and fall off plus people can't see you car hasn't got Sat nav as standard.",5
1852,Simple good...,5
1853,"Simple to put up, and adjust to different window sizes. No more waking up at 4am because its so bright outside!",5
1854,Simple to put up. Fabulous for any room. Works fabulously bought a second for my other room,5

1857,Simply brilliant,5
1858,Simply excellent.,5
1859,Simply the best purchase I've made on Amazon. It has cured my summer insomnia. A truly superb buy.,5
1860,"Since getting this blind my toddlers sleeping has improved significantly. He wakes up when he has had enough sleep instead of when the light wakes him up. Resulting in a better mood throughout the day. Definitely recommend. The only disadvantage with this blind is the price, I have a new baby due anytime and to buy another one these would be very expensive.",5
1861,"Sit nicely, good buy",5
1862,Small neat and does the job,5
1863,"Small,sturdy and holds both an iPhone 6 Plus and an iPhone 4 securely in place. I like not having to have a case on the phone too.",5
1864,Smaller than I thought but very pleased with them,5
1865,"Smart and tidy little holder! Spins around really easy, so you can watch a video or view maps better.Nice and easy transaction!",5

1869,So far so good an excellent tablet,5
1870,So far so good! Lots of variety and my little one loves it!,5
1871,So far so good. I would say a must buy for any child if you have prime. It’s soneasy to setup and my daughter found it very easy to navigate through the menus,5
1872,So far so good. Kids love them & peace of mind with the 2yrs warranty,5
1873,"So far, so good.",5
1874,"So far, so good. Very easy to set up, the parental controls are great. Only slight issue is no kids tube, can get YouTube though. My son is very happy with it. Would recommend",5
1875,"So glad I purchased this electric breast pump. I had a manual one (another branded one) and felt I I didn't really know what I was doing. The size wasn't comfortable and didn't seem to have another. But this electric pump is really comfortable, easy to clean and the bottle is amazing. My daughter was great at taking a random expressed bottle here and there and suddenly wouldn't touch it. Refusing to feed from bottles. As soon as I used the lansinoh momma bottle, she took to it like a duck in water! So happy. And the customer service from them was great too, with needing a bigger size cushion they kindly sent one for free! Highly recommend if your debating which one to go for.",5
1876,"So glad i purchased this, the back of the unit is such good quality it really grips into the vent whereas a lot of cheap brittle ones just break and rattle.  This has rubber pincers at the back and feels really well made. I bought htis expecting it to droop onto the  shelf underneath the vent which is fine, however this could go on any vent without support so its a god product.",5
1877,So handy - great for keeping in my little ones overnight bag for sleepovers at the grandparents house. Very easy to use though can be a little fiddly sometimes.,5
1878,"So handy, my little girl will only sleep in the dark!",5
1879,So I have no children and bought this product for myself as I have trouble sleeping in bright rooms! My room just has light blinds and as its a rental I didn't want to shell out for curtain rail and curtains. This is AMAZING!! It makes my room lovely and dark and I wake up when I want to now! Great for lie ins on the weekend too. I also took it to my grandpas house who has paper thin curtains and it worked a treat there too!! Fab product,5
1880,"so impressed with this - the suction cups haven’t failed once and the product has been up for 3 weeks straight, blocking the sun and cooling my room down. An excellent product well worth the price!",5
1881,So much quieter and smoother than the Series 7 I replaced.  Really pleased with the whole package.,5
1882,"So pleased we got this. After moving from a house where there were wooden blinds in addition to curtains to one with just black out curtains, we were finding our daughter was finding it harder to fall asleep and also waking significantly earlier.From the first night we put this up she slept properly again. Even sleeping in until 9:30 that weekend. Worth every penny.",5

1887,"Some friends were using this in their baby's room and they also take it with them on car journeys so when I moved into my new place and didn't have any curtains I got one for myself!  Fits all the windows in the house, easily adjusts to different sizes via the velcro, sticks to the window without coming off and it doesn't let any light in. Tick.",5
1888,"Some people buy these for their babies, but I bought it for myself because the venetian blinds we had on the bedroom window was leaking a lot of light in.And... success! now I'm able to sleep on average two hours longer every night.Makes the room (almost) pitch black. Very good purchase.",5
1889,someone I knew had one and recommended. I use it at it’s full width and length and it works well.  It’s not fallen down yet and has been up for a week. Very pleased with it.,5

1894,"sticks very wellit covers the edges by overlapping the frame a bitit is a thick tough plactic fabric, i think it will last wellit is very big and can be orientated portrait or landscapeeven if it does not cover the whole window it really helps and thin curtains when bunched at the uncovered end did the job well enough even for daytime sleeps and early bedtimes",5

1917,Superb at blocking out the light. The suckers make it really versatile too.,5
1918,Superb close shave.I upgraded from an ageing 7-790 and immediately felt the difference in a smoother shave.,5
1919,"Superb machine! Quite, efficient, with a battery that goes on and on and... it does NOT spill stubble all over the toilet when you use it, that being perhaps the most remarkable difference with its predecessor. An all-round winner.",5
1920,superb piece of kit with unrivalled guarantee.. My lad loves it. A worthy replacement for his Hudl2 that finally died,5
1921,Superb quality! We use these at home for our kids and at our static caravan,5
1922,"Superb Shave. I have used a great number or electrical razors and more recently they have all been the '3 head' rotary style, which seemed to cut well at first but didn't give me a good shave.I read loads of the very helpful reviews for the Braun series 9 and thought if i was going to buy yet another razor it had to be one of the best! I must say i have been very pleased with performance so far, and the self cleaner seems to be very good (cleans the razor then proceeds to charge it up for you). No issues with even changing over to the more linear cutters here and the shave itself is very smooth. Noise level is good too doesn't make a racket like some others!I used to use an electric razor one day a week then top it up with a wet shave (razor blade) but now i dont have to. well done braun.",5
1923,"Superb, nice material, position properly it gives complete blackout. 5star",5
1924,Superb. Completely shuts out the light and there are plenty of suction mounts to help you fit it to a smaller sized window than the blind - top product,5
1925,"Superb. Robust and great concept. Content included is excellent. Bought one for each kid.For next version: some sort of fold out stand integrated into the case. But the case is grippy so a full glass of water behind it works.Minor gripes:First is software design. As often with Amazon, the software isn’t up to the standard set by Apple. Not that it’s bad, it isn’t, it’s good, it’s just not as polished.Second is offline video. Need Netflix for that.",5
1926,Surprised at how good this was for the price. Thought it would just slip out of the air vent but no it stays in firmly whilst holding the phone. I've got a renault clio 2002 and fits just fine.,5
1927,"Surprisingly good. I thought it wouldn't work but works great in a Citroen DS3. My phone (Samsung Galaxy A5) has never fallen out, so I'm well pleased.",5
1928,"Take it on all my trips, even if the window is small or large I use it.",5
1929,Terrific value.  Very pretty earrings.,5
1930,Thank you,5
1931,Thank you for this product.We can finally sleep again during the summer period and we had no issues at all attaching the suction cups to the windows.I just don't understand why most flats in the UK use light coloured curtains instead of proper blinds. A total life saver!,5
1932,thanks,5
1933,"ThanksI have problems with the DC power cable is not compatible for Italy, what can I do to get the right cable?",5
1934,The bedroom used by my various grand children when they sleep over is a very sunny room - it never really gets dark in summer - dusk at about 10.30 then it starts to get light again around 3 - not good for persuading children that its bed time - this product works a treat - well done!,5
1935,The best close shave ever chrome looking but only I look at it so no problem,5
1936,The best electric shaver i have used. Shave better than a razor.,5
1937,The best investment ever!! Light nights and light mornings mean little ones find it hard to get to sleep or stay asleep. But with this the room stays dark also it keeps the bedroom bit cooler if put up before sun gets in.,5
1938,"The BEST kid's tablet on the market. Tough — brilliant quality age appropriate games and apps — and the 2 year, no quibble guarantee (if it gets broken) is a fantastic incentive. We've got one each for our twins who've just turned 5. These are the best tablets we've come across!  Would highly recommend.",5
1939,The best phone holder I tried so far. Small and do not get in the way.,5
1940,The best phone holder I've had.,5
1941,"The best purchase for our daughters birthday! So much is included in the free kids unlimited for a year! The disney interactive books are the best!Haven't had to use the warranty, but love that if anything happens within 2 years amazon gives me a replacement, no questions asked!!!!",5
1942,"The best shave ever.. i have tried just about every razor, wet and dry, but i always ended up with razor rash. Finally bit the bullet and splashed the cash on the 9095... what a machine, ultra close shave, no more red face or break outs and i can shave every day also... wish i had spent my money on this years ago... well recommended and well worth the money",5
1943,The best Shaver I have ever had. Dave,5
1944,"The best tablet I have bought for my kids. I've had the Samsung for kids and it broke after a year and compared to their interface this is amazing, I was blown away with it and it's so easy to use. Its settings are fantastic and the parental controls are a blessing.",5
1945,"The blackout blinds are a good thing, not just for babies but for anyone that wanted to get a goodnight sleep without the light shinning in the windows. I would recommend this too anyone.",5
1946,The blind works really well it makes my room really dark. I found it really easy to put up and it stays up all night. Really happy with the product,5
1947,"The Braun Series 9 9040s Wet  and Dry  Electrical confused me at first as the charger is displayed on the cover box but there was no charger unit with the box,sure that must confuse a lot of people!I had to invest in a shaver plug but got one here on Amazon for £1 with free postage so can't complain about that,the instructions were easy to follow from the booklet and I indeed,give it an hour to charge,I don't normally use an electric shaver and I found this product,really gave a nice dry shave i a very short time,I have sensetive skin,so after the shave I applied a skincare product to avoid any dry patches on the skin.I found the clipping off from the unit to clean the shaver head very easy to do and again thanks to the book,I know to keep it switched on as I cleaned the unit,I really like hte little zip up black contauner the shaver goes into,ideal for putting in a suitcase,for a weekend away,holiday.I haven't tried the wet shave yet;but certainly will do,I was throughly impressed by the Braun Series 9 9040 and it really saves me so much time i the morning now,highly recommended.",5
1948,"The Braun Series 9 is a serious leap forward in electric shavers. I usually shave with a Gilette Mach 3 Manual Razor but have tried (and reviewed) the Braun Series 5 and Series 7, so I can compare the new series 9 to a manual shave and to the previous models.The big difference with the Series 9 is the addition of a fourth trimmer in between the two main foils. The Series 5 & 7 had one ""Active Lift Trimmer"" and the Series 9 has the ""Direct and Cut Trimmer"" (cuts hair growing in different directions) & the ""HyperLift and Cut Trimmer"" (lifts and cuts flat lying hairs). Forget the fancy names - do they work and do they make a difference? The answer is yes! The shave is noticeably closer especially in certain areas and actually gave me a closer shave than a manual razor on the upper lip, under the chin and on the jaw line which was remarkable! This is the first time I have had a closer shave with an electric razor. The only problem area that it didn't do so well on was right at the bottom of the neck (where I often get ingrown hairs if I shave against the grain). It did an ok job, but when I went over it with a manual razor I got a cleaner finish.So the redesign of the foil is great (which is just as well because the replacement foils cost twice as much - £40 versus £20 for the series 7)What's in the box:The Shaver, charger, regular case, lubricating oil, cleaning brush and manualPros:Fully waterproof (up to 5m) so you can shave in the showerCan dry shave or with shaving foam, oil or gelClean & Charge ""docking"" station - charges the shaver, analyses the  brush head and cleans using replacement cartridgesCharges in less than an hour and holds the charge for a long timeExcellent performance - closer than a manual razor in most places (see above)No beard rashFoil is meant to last at least 18 months before needing replacementHead is fully adjustable and can be locked in place for stubborn areasCons:Can't be used plugged in so if battery is flat you will need to charge it firstManual says not to use shaving gel/foam if using Clean & Charge station to clean heads so need to rinse under the tap insteadFoils are more expensive (but still cheaper than buying 18 months worth of high end manual razor blade heads)Will need replacement Clean & Renew cartridge every 2 months which adds to the running cost (approx. £12 for 3 which is a 6 month supply)All in all this is THE electric shaver on the market right now. If you already use one and especially if you have used previous Braun models in the past - it is definitely worth upgrading. Unlike manual razors where adding another blade just seems like a marketing gimmick the redesigned foil head is miles better than before. You'll only get a closer shave at the barbers!",5
1949,"The case means if the tablet gets dropped or knocked off a side to a flat surface the screen cant get damaged as it sticks out further that the screen. Also it takes the shock from a fall. It is the perfect size.  My daughter got this for her 3rd birthday and so she didnt sit on it all the time we used the parental controls to set limits and ""sleep times"" on it. We set the age content as well. I never have to worry what she accesses as it is only set for her age.",5
1950,The child love this and it is robustly made.,5
1951,The children love them,5
1952,The clip comes in a small box and is securely pakage. It tooka bit of fiddling to get the clip secured but this was probably down to the design of the vents in my car. The clip can expand to hold a range pf phone types and had no problems dealing with an iphone 6s plus.,5
1953,"The device clamps my iPhone securely & attaches into one of the grills in my VW securely, so happy with the product.",5
1954,The earrings are exactly as shown and are really beautiful.,5
1955,"The fire for kids is great, both of my children love them. There's so much to do on them, not just playing games or watching programmes. You can read too",5
1956,"The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is fantastic!The tablet comes in a reassuring drop proof rubber case, so feels safe and study for kid use.There is no screen protector though (would of perhaps been a good idea) but that said there’s a 2 year warranty if anything happens anyway.It was easy to set up the child account with excellent parental control and comes with a 1 year Fire For Kids subscription, so my little ones were up and running straight away.I like how you can also set/manage goals for X time on books & apps etc. or even limit time spent using it in the parent account.I purchased this on a recommendation from someone and very glad I did, the kids love it!",5
1957,"The first razor I have used that has been satisfactory in every way. Makes shaving quicker and easier than ever before, and avoids the little nicks caused by wet shaving with a blade",5
1958,The grandchildren love it!!,5
1959,The Gro Anywhere Blackout Blind is amazing!! Very easy to put up. Lots of suction pads and plenty of Velcro to adjust the sizing. Good quality material. I've even used it in my room as sometimes work nights and it blacks out light perfectly!Really helpful that it's portable and comes in the handy bag for carrying around,5
1960,"The group anywhere blind is a fantastic product, it was really easy to fit to my 8 month old daughters bedroom. Thanks to this blackout blind I now get to have a lay in every morning, not being woken by a excited little person until 7 apposed to the usual 4.30 she had liked.",5
1961,"The kids and I love it. The image quality is great, the screen is clear and sharp. There are loads of fun and educational games. I also like the time limits you can put on it so that it's not just Dad saying you've been playing too long, the tablet tells them times up. It's all kid proof apart from the screen so I ordered a tempered glass screen protector with it and recommend you do the same. It is easy to pop the tablet out of the kid proof case to fit the screen protector.",5
1962,The kids love and knowing that they can not access in appropriate sites is great.,5
1963,The lady in question to which I gave as a surprise gift on a first date is now a permanent part of my life. They did the trick>,5
1964,"The Lansinoh single breast pump is extremely easy to use.  It has a let down phase and an expressing phase.  After 2 minutes it automatically switches from let down to expressing, although you can switch it over earlier with a simple push of one button.  The pump is very easy to put together and there are not that many parts that need washing and sterilising after each use.  The pump is very easy to use and has easy to follow buttons.  It is easy to control the strength of the pump.  I found that I only needed to use a low level to get a good supply of milk.  The breastpump is very quiet compared to some others that I have seen/heard.  The suctions cups are comfortable and easy to put in place.  There was a long cable from the machine to the plug which meant that it was easy to use in a variety of places without the need for an extention lead.  I found this pump to be as good as the hospital grade machines that I had used in hospital and I was able to get the same amount of milk or sometimes even more.",5
1965,"the little one loves it , my only gripe is the parental controls to do with time limits could do with a bit of polishing as they can be a tad confooozing otherwise a great bit of kit and with the unlimited option there are loads of things for them to do or watch",5
1966,The most attractive earrings I have ordered yet. I really love them and the price is unbelievable. AG.,5
1967,"The Mpow E-Clip Air Vent Car Mount is an amazing product. The item arrived within expected time and packaging it arrived in was strong and durable, which resulted in the product being un-damaged. The product really grips your phone, ensuring that your phone will not slide out of the mount. It is really what it says on the tin; the clipping of your phone to the mount is easy and fast which is the unique selling point of this product.Unlike other mounts I have bought, this mount really keeps your phone still and will mount on any car without the problem of the mount sliding around,The mount holds multiple sized phones, which is a great feature. This is a great product, and would recommend this product especially thoes who have a habit of always checking their phone when driving.",5
1968,"The new favorite tablet in our house, Kids love it, easy to use and decent battery life",5
1969,The product arrived promptly. Item does exactly as described. An ingenious design that works perfectly. I am very pleased,5
1970,"The product is handy to keep attached to one of your air vents. The eclip is attached pretty easily and can get a tight fit so that the holder is secure. The blades are protected with rubber ends so that it does not scratch your air vents. The blades can be rotated 360 degrees to suit individual preference.The holder adjusts up to 3.9inches which is useful when swapping phones in the holder. The expandable grip keeps the phone secure and doesn’t feel like it will slip out or move which gives you peace of mind.As the holder is on the air vent it blends in pretty well and you almost don’t notice it when it’s in the car unless you have you phone attached! Compared to other holders which block your view on the windscreen this is a lot better for positioning.Overall the product is very efficient and for the price you can’t go wrong, the only thing I have to warn is not to yank the holder out of the air vent like I did one day as one of the rubber ends fell of the end and I have yet to get it out, however this was my fault so don’t be aggressive with it. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a small and neat phone holder for their car!",5
1971,"The product is shipped in a nicely designed box and attaches to the air vents in your Car and allows your Phone to be placed in a cradle. Mounting the clip to the vent is easy and completed by pressing the rubber clips onto the vent and then placing your Phone in the cradleIt features a 360 degree swivel mechanism so that the cradle can be moved into the right position. Since this is a universal mount, it should fit most cars and phones with ease. The arms at either side of the mount can be adjusted to fit any Phone with a width between 6 and 10 cm. I found the rubber clips to be very secure when mounted to a vent. Another feature worth mentioning is that if you insert a credit card into the vent clip, it is transformed into a kickstand.This is a great solution for mounting a Phone safely in the Car and I can recommend this to anyone who is after a cheap and easy solution, which does not obstruct any part of the windscreen or dashboard.",5
1972,"The product turned up on time, and was what I wanted for use on my wedding day",5
1973,The Shaver does what it required to do,5
1974,"The shipping was Fantastic, I expected to have the item 4 days later than when I ordered but I received it the day after. The product, the birthday package and the card on it were amazing. My partner is so happy and he likes it. Thank you",5
1975,The speaker on the tablet when at full volume goes all crackly and the sound is distorted,5
1976,"The tablet is great, the cover needs a handle.",5
1977,"The ultimate tablet for children, nothing else on the market comes close to fire for kids.",5
1978,"There are plenty of in-depth reviews so I am going to keep mine brief.I bought this having decided to return to shaving after a twenty-five year break, mainly due to always having suffered greatly with shaving rashes. Using this in conjunction with a good quality cream (Taylors of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Collection Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin) and brush has been a revelation and works as well in the shower as it does at the sink.It has coped with four day growth easily and I suspect it would hold a charge for multiple shaves easily but I am unable to verify because I use the cleaning function after every shave. I find the machine easy to hold, even in the shower, and at no time does it feel ungainly or not able to reach those tricky places.Is it worth the money? Well, this was a gamble that has paid off because I am very happy with it;s functionality, weight and quality and best of all, no shaving rash!",5
1979,There great like very much where them all the time they look great like the catch at the back keeps them safe,5
1980,"There is no doubt that an electric shaver offers a serious saving in time and effort over the traditional safety razor I normally use, but over the years I have favoured the old fashioned method as the electric shavers I have tried have all had the same two faults - they alternate between not getting close enough or getting too close so that my face is a patchwork of areas that are either stubbly or flayed. However, this was many years ago and the shavers tried were definitely from the budget end of the market. Now, thanks to the Amazon Vine programme, I have the opportunity to try a premium electric shaver. And boy, is this a premium one.  Price wise I cannot find many that top it. So, what do you get for your cash?  Well, the box contains one shaver, a clean and charge station, a cleaning cartridge, plug, cleaning brush and a leather pouch.Straight out of the box this has a reassuring weight and a well made feel to it.  The handle is ergonomic and easy to manipulate the shaver all round your face, even for a left hander.  The charging/cleaning station was something new to me.  This, as the name suggests, charges the battery and also cleans/lubricates the shaver in an alcohol solution.  This is a genius invention.  Charging was quick and easy with an LED display to show battery level. The first shave was excellent.  Way better than any electric shave in the past, with no irritation of the skin, flayed bits or unshaven patches. And at the press of a button a nifty little trimmer popped out for tidying up those stray sideburns. I used this dry on a 3 day beard the first time (3 days for me being pretty thick and hard to deal with) and the device removed it with ease. The finish was really good, almost as good as with a razor. I have also used it wet, with a good shaving gel and had similar excellent results.  It has totally changed my mind about the effectiveness of electric shavers. Once used the thing is put back into the cleaner/charger and is soon in perfect condition for the next use. That aspect of it is genius, as I suspect a lot of shavers suffer from poor upkeep/cleaning, and their performance deteriorates accordingly.  This should ensure that there is no deterioration with this device.All in all an excellent shaver.  Miles better than any of the budget ones I have tried previously.  I cannot comment if it is better or worse than other premium shavers of the same price range, but certainly I felt that the increase in price was reflected in the increase in performance. 5 stars.",5
1981,"There is not much to say about this product, except that it is excellent. It really does black out the room, is very big, stays put and I also like to starry pattern. Makes it look quite appealing, as plain black would have been a little gloomy.",5
1982,These are amazingThanks,5
1983,These are fab - almost totally dark!  You'll probably never get every single little crack covered but these do an excellent job in the British summertime.  I bought two and would recommend them.,5
1984,"These are fantastic & I have recommended them to everyone I know with kids! Can't rate them enough. We have two which come with us on every overnight stay, holidays etc. It's the only way for a chance of a lay in in summer months.",5
1985,"These are great  Blackout blinds especially when on holiday.  They are large and so can fit a number of different sized windows.  The times we've forgotten to take it work is,  we've always ended up kicking ourselves.  A must for any  parent of young children",5
1986,These are great - definitely worth a purchase. We got one for when we moved home so our little one could sleep in the spare room while we decorated her room for her. Excellent.,5
1987,These are lovely delicate earrings which have been remarked and complimented on when worn. Look much more expensive on than what they cost.,5
1988,These blinds are an absolute must. I cant express how great these are for anyone whos child is up with the sun so in the summer thats 4am. This one in particular is great its very big so my daughter uses it for nannas house but also folds smaller so we used it on holiday too. Very easy to use aswell with the suction cups and fold up very easy back into its bag.,5
1989,"These blinds are great and block out so much light it really helps with getting the kids to sleep in the summer. The suckers can be an issue but definitely work better on a clean window with a little bit of water dabbed on to help them stick. Only issue I have is how much it stops the breeze coming through the window if it’s a hot night, but you can’t have everything ay!",5
1990,"These blinds are perfect for taking on holiday where curtains after so often really thin. Small, lightweight and came in a handy carry bag. We have three of these. This one is a newer version and has velcro tabs making it easier to fit a smaller window. Wouldn't be without them. If the kids sleep well, we sleep well! Not for everyday use though",5
1991,"These earrings are elegant and the crystal has a lovely sparkle to it. If you like sophisticated and understated, then these are the earrings for you. Love them.",5
1992,These earrings are fab!  Definitely buy from here again.,5
1993,These earrings are just beautiful.  I have bought them as a present but have not given them yet,5
1994,These earrings are lovely would definitely recommend,5
1995,"These earrings are really beautiful, I am really pleased with the quality and appearance of them, well worth the money.",5
1996,"These earrings are really nice and pretty. I like the hook ones because i can't be doing with fiddling with little butterfly clip things, you just put these in bish bash bosh!",5
1997,These earrings are so sparkly and so pretty. look a lo more expensive than they are.would recommend to others.,5
1998,These earrings arrived the next day and were exactly as described. Very pretty and sparkly.,5
1999,"These havea been a brilliant purchase. So easy to monitor what’s being read/watched/played and the parental control set up is brilliant, allowing us to set times and amount of use. The cases are great too! If you want the speed of an iPad then buy an iPad but these are totally great for kids. We use them for online homeward like Mathletics and Mathseeds. Both these websites are still a bit clunky but that’s the fault of the web builders not the Fire! Would def recommend for children. And would choose this over the veraion7!",5
2000,These look lovely . They are an extra gift for my mother so hope she loves  also .Will be buying again from this company .Brilliant prices,5
2001,"These summer months have been so bright, although we have black out curtains they aren't long enough to keep the room 100% dark so the blind did the trick and very easy to fit. We plan on bringing this on holiday too.",5
2002,"These were an absolute life saver on a recent holiday. Small package that takes up hardly any room, yet covered a very large glass window, almost full length. Without these the little monster I call a daughter would no doubt have been woken up pre 5 am as the sun shone straight into her room.Instead we actually got a few lie ins (7am ish!) which as any other parent will agree is worth triple the price of these blinds!!",5
2003,"These were lovely, boxed well, received them promptly and brilliant value, no complaints whatsoever!! 👍",5
2004,They are absolutely lovely,5
2005,"They are lovely earrings,  very pleased with my purchase,  thank you",5
2006,They are very beautiful and dainty in my ears,5
2007,"They look stunning, I cannot believe that I only paid  £6.99 for them. I certainly couldn't have afforded them at full price",5
2008,This  Braun Shaver has to e the best I have ever had and I have had a few .I would say it is almost as good as a wet shave.The cleaning unit is so good and an improvement on my old Braun .The cleaning unit is also the charger and that is a good effective fast charger.As a overview I have rated this product with a 5 Star yes it's a good job.,5
2009,"This allows me to be hands free when driving, especially great when using directions. I place it on my radiator grille and means I can keep my eyes firmly on the road. It holds my mobile securely in place.",5
2010,This an amazing product.I opened it and switched it on and the screens guided you through the set up.I can barely work a remote control and can honestly say this was the easiest set up ever. Next the download......again easy as anything....Lots and lots to keep my 5 yr old stimulated and entertained from books to games..I wish I had known of this device sooner!!,5
2011,"This arrived in it's own little box free from damage. It is a nice little in car phone mount that is ideal for my van.To fit the holder it just slots on to the air vents wherever best suits you on which side suits you. It is small and unobtrusive so does not get in the way. To attach the phone it is a pincer type holder so push open the sides place your phone in the middle and release the sides on to the phone to grip it in place. It holds well and doesn't move when fitted and the weight of my phone doesn't cause any issues to the positioning.It is a smart, basic little mount that does it's job well.",5
2012,This blackout blind really works.  Easy to stick on the window and remove in the morning.  Would highly recommend if you prefer a darker room to snooze in,5
2013,"This blind has been a life saver for our baby. We initially used it when our son was in our bedroom as we didn't want a black out blind, we already have a Venetian up. It blocks out pretty much all of the light if you fit it right into the corners. We also recently took it on holiday and blocked out the window near our sons cot.",5
2014,This blind has been the only thing that has worked so far to create a really dark room for my little one.  Having suction cups on all sides makes it really nice so you can use it on any window up to the max. size of the blind.  It is light weight and well made.,5
2015,This blind is an excellent buy. It is versatile in that it can be adapted to fit several window sizes. It also does the job as a blackout blind perfectly. I am really pleased with this purchase and heartily recommend it.,5
2016,This blind is great for blocking out the sun. It's huge so can fit all kinds of windows (check your dimensions with the product description if you're not sure). It is adjustable so you can literally take it anywhere. The suckers don't always stick on very well but seem to be fine when you wet them slightly.,5
2017,"This blind is great, on these bright summer mornings it does it's job perfectly.",5
2018,This blind is great. It fits various different sizes of windows and glass doors. It attaches easily and stays in place - the suction cups do not lose their vacuum and come off the glass even when the glass warms up in the sun but are easily removable when needed and stored in the included bag. The blind can easily be resized using the attached velcro strips.In addition to it's functionality it has a lovely star print on one side. Highly recommended.,5
2019,"This blind is perfect for blocking out most of the light from a large window. It is enough to get a baby to sleep in the early evening during the summer. The room will not be as completely dark as with an installed blackout blind, but on the plus side there are no dangerous blind cords dangling from it, it is completely portable, and can be put up or taken down in seconds.For the first week it fell off the window every night, we then started to moisten the pads before sticking to the window - now the blind stays attached all night.",5
2020,This blind is very handy and will fit to literally any sized window. We stay over at a relatives house and it fits her small window well by using the velcro sections as well as our large bay window. very handy now the days are getting longer and the mornings brighter.,5
2021,"This blind really keeps a room dark, and is useful for both children and adults who wake up early in the summer month's long days. Very easy to put up and take down. I even took it on holiday.",5
2022,this curtain makes the bedroom pitch black. Really pleased!,5
2023,This Fire HD for kids is absolutely amazing. It does everything we want for our girl and so much more. The education before play is a great option. The only down side I can find is that my girl loves music and cannot get access to our music account. It’s no problem as we can just put it on my profile and listen to it from there. Would be great for amazon to actually make a amazon music app for kids. Overall though we couldn’t be happier!,5
2024,"This has been a gift which keeps on giving. It has really encouraged my children to read! The fact that there is a library with so many books to choose from keeps them entertained all day long. I now struggle to take the tablet away from them because surely there is no such thing as reading too much if they enjoy it, it's there?",5
2025,"This has been a life saver throughout the summer months. It has suckers that stick to the windows, they are not the best but I found once in place and left alone not much readjustment need. If you are taking down and putting up each night it come become annoying.But really blocks out the light. I would definitely recommend",5
2026,this has been a lifesaver during the summer when the sun is late at setting and actually used it pretty much for 4 months solid to keep the room nice and dark for the little one to sleep.,5
2027,"This has been a lifesaver in so many situations. We used it when my husband was very ill when I was pregnant, so he could sleep during the day. We then used it at the hospital in the delivery room to block out the glaring sun light and keep a calm and cool atmosphere. And now we currently use it in our new house in our bedroom as the sun shines in as soon as it rises so it keeps us and the baby seeping until a more suitable time. Easy to attach, detach and adjust to required size. Also very handy to come in its own pouch. I highly recommend this product.",5
2028,This has been an amazing purchase for holiday!,5
2029,this has been an invaluable item to include in holiday packing when going with our grandchildren. Its also been really useful during the summer at home when the curtains don't quite keep out the sunshine for those necessary afternoon naps (for the children of course!!),5
2030,"This has been brilliant for my 5 year old, tablet is intuitive for a child to use and the customer service is amazing, broken screen and tablet replaced within 48 hours no quibble at all..",5
2031,"This has been our saviour since the clocks went back... Our little one had been waking earlier and earlier, despite decent black-out lined curtains which seemed to do the trick last summer.  As soon as we started putting these up she started sleeping much longer in the mornings.  They take a couple of minutes to put up, and sometimes are a little bit fiddley, but basically very straightforward and good to use.  We are using them at home at the moment, and they will definitely become a staple for when we go away on holiday.  Also handy when you move house, in case you've got windows with no curtains for the first few nights!",5
2032,"This has been the best thing I've bought for ages I've used it the whole summer, taken it on holiday and away on weekends, keeps my sons room nice and dark. Highly recommend!",5
2033,This is a brilliant pump-very effective and comfortable. Pretty quiet considering what a good job it does. I've been really pleased with how helpful Lansinoh are as a company-a uk based helpline which sent out spare parts for the pump free of charge! Couldn't be happier with the pump or the excellent service from Lansinoh.,5
2034,This is a fantastic blind - lots of suckers and it's massive - whereever we have taken our little girl this has covered the window very well,5
2035,This is a fantastic product! I work shifts including late and night shifts so wanted something to black out for when I work such shifts. This is really effective and easy to use. Thank you,5
2036,This is a fantastic pump. Much easier than using a manual pump and still relatively quiet.,5
2037,"This is a fantastic shaver, no really, it is.  It is the best shaver I have ever had and I have been using Braun shavers for about 25 years.  I say this because the shave is not only fast but the closest shave you can get with an electric shaver. IMHO of course.The only negative point I can think of is that the plug is so heavy it doesn't want to stay in the wall mounted shaver points.  I ended up buying a UK plug to shaver point and charge/clean it outside of the bathroom.",5
2038,"This is a fantastic tablet for young kids. Easy to set up , easy to use and with loads of content already stored on there.  The web is pretty restrictive so probbaly not ideal for older children who want to also go online a lot.  But absolutely perfect for my 5 year old and great value.",5
2039,This is a god send. Our 3 year old now sleeps through 95% of the time and with a newborn in the house it is a timely purchase. Once you work out the best way to fit it to your chosen ejido it is great and of course entirely portable too.,5
2040,This is a godsend device and enables us to blackout the babies room for optimal sleep.,5
2041,This is a good little phone holder. Not complex or fiddly. Simple to attach to the ventilation grill.,5
2042,This is a good product... I now have a place to keep my phone when i am driving.,5
2043,This is a great blind. We use it on our bedroom window in the summer and it really helps me sleep. No more 5am wake ups from the sun. Solid quality and an abundance of suck pads to keep it in place. Highly recommended. Changed my summer life!!,5
2044,This is a great device. It is small so great for travelling. It fits neatly to the air vent and displays your phone at the right angle.,5
2045,This is a great little tablet. My 4 year old loves it and the parental controls are very comprehensive,5
2046,This is a great product which made our lives easier especially while travelling. I have one permenantly used in my son's bedroom and another one ready to go for travels.,5
2047,"This is a great product. It's easy to use straight out of the box, requiring minimal set up. We found the settings useful to alter how much suction there was. There's nothing much more to say really. Highly recommended!!",5
2048,This is a great purchase. I bought it for my Daughter’s bedroom as she kept waking up at 4am because it was so light outside. Now she stays asleep until at least 7am. This blind is easy to fit and completely blacks out the room.  I only bought it last week and have already ordered another one for my niece’s bedroom.,5
2049,"This is a great shaver.  I bought it to replace a Panasonic LA93, I have also owned a Braun Series 7 recently so I can compare the three. They are all great shavers, and it is difficult to pick between them.The Braun 9 is very well put together, it feels well made and the shaving head looks very intricate.  It is primarily plastic so is lighter than the Braun 7, but similar to the Panasonic. The Braun 7 is the most weighty of the three and feels good in the hand, but I appreciate that lighter materials are probably cheaper, and a lighter overall shaver is probably preferable for some customers.The Panasonic is an excellent shaver, probably the closest shave of the three, but all shave very well indeed, certainly closer than anything I've owned in the past.  The Panasonic has the best designed shaving head as it has a very wide field of movement, more than both Braun models.All three have good cleaning stands and I'm interested to see how the Braun 9 design fares.  I found the Panasonic cradle tended to collect dried on hair and required manual cleaning from time to time. One thing about the Braun cleaning system which is good, and bad too, is the cleaning solution.  It is alcohol based and I think does a better job than the Panasonic system, but it evaporates over time.  I clean my shaver in the system every 5 or 6 days and if you do two things you will save money - firstly make sure you clean as much hair out of the shaving head as you can before you put it into the cleaning system.  Secondly,  take the cleaning cartridge out of the unit after the cleaning cycle is complete, and reseal it.  If you do that then one cartridge will last months rather than weeks. That will save a fair bit of money over the life of the shaver.In terms of performance, all three are good.  Braun 9 is marginally better than Braun 7, but I think the Panasonic is at least the equal of the Braun 9.  The Braun 7 is better than both of the others in one respect, shaving the upper lip.  I find that the very large shaving head of the Panasonic and the Braun 9 makes that task a little tricky.All in all I'm pleased with the Braun 9.  I took advantage of a Lightning Deal to get it at a very good price.  I'm sure it will be a pleasure to own and use.  If you already own a top quality shaver then you will not see a step change in results, but you can feel confident that you have a great piece of kit.One other thing to note, the Braun 9 I received has a 5 element LED display rather than the numerical display in the Amazon description, I don't think this is a big negative point, but I do think that you should receive exactly the same specification that you see on screen.",5
2050,"This is a great tablet, my three year old can whizz around it and there are lots of excellent games he loves to play. My son is autistic and during a meltdown he accidentally broke the screen. Amazon immediately replaced it with a ‘reconditioned’ tablet with no questions asked. I received the new one within 2 days. Invaluable for parents of children with difficulties.The big rubber protector is very good and it does work excellently to protect the tablet when he accidentally drops it.Only issue I have is that I can’t use an anti-virus package that I purchased (Norton) as I can’t download it from the Amazon store. I had already purchased this and am a bit miffed that I can’t protect the tablet with it.Apart from that I would give it 5 stars.",5
2051,This is a outstanding product and very fast delivery,5
2052,"This is a review of the braun series 9 (£190 version) bought from AmazonI've used braun series 7 prior and can honestly say the series 9 is far superior, shaves closer than the 7 in stubborn areas, and feels like I've just had a wet shave, it really is that close a shave.I used it for a dry shave as I'm used to that, and even though it's a very close shave, no skin irritationWonderful well pleased.",5
2053,"This is a two part review - one from the man of the house, the other from the woman of the house.  Waited a few weeks to see if the initial impressions were the same after the novelty wore off.He saysFor a life long safety razor shave this was a real surprise. I had occasionally used my fathers rotary razor and found it tore at the whiskers rather than cut them.The Braun 9040 is quite chunky,  black plastic with a flexible head. The foil cutting cartridge comes off  easily for  cleaning. The shave is comparable to a good safety razor, but I find shaving takes half as long. I now regularly shave twice a day and feel much better groomed. Missing the routine of the soap and safety razor I find the wet shave a pleasure, the razor is easy to clean.Irritatingly the Braun comes with a two pin shaver plug, the charging transformer is in the plug which makes it heavy and pulls out of the socket. There is a travelling case, but no where to store the power cable.For an expensive and fancy piece of kit the packaging is disappointing, a flimsy cardboard box and a badly laid out manual covering all Braun 9 series razors, useless information about cleaning stations for other models.It is interesting to see the price has dipped by a third, so maybe there is a new model to follow. The  foil cartridges are 35£ and said to last six months.I thought I would miss my safety razor, but I am very happy to continue with this razor. I do feel better groomed.She saysDefinitely cuts close and smooth first thing in the morning.  If there is an area it is less good on - ie stubble regrowth it is the top lip.Am surprised with a piece of kit like this that there is not a little light that shows you where you are shaving.  It is a feature on a depilator I have which is really useful.Oh and him indoors says that after three weeks he does feel the blade is less sharp.",5
2054,"This is a very high quality item that compares very favourably to the parallel Panasonic product, and to be honest, would be very hard to beat as a wet / dry razor. The handset is attractively made from chrome style metal and back rubberised plastic, making it very easy to hold. One of the simple but attractive features for me is that the on/off switch is well away from where you would hold it the unit. Real design thought. The retractable trimmer at the back is a standard feature, but works really well, and is excellent for working on ears and sideburns. Also marked is the lockable movable head which gives a lot of flexibility of usage, adapting to whichever posture suits.I’m ashamed to say that I initially felt the handset is a little tinny and slightly lighter than I thought it would be: I’ve definitely changed my mind and I believe that this makes it comfortable to handle. Braun definitely starts to pull away from its competitors with the charging and cleaning unit which is really well designed by comparison to the clumsy Panasonic version that I've had previously. The cleaning fluid is in a sealed cartridge that locks into the unit well rather than the very awkward and fiddly sachets of cleaning fluid for use with my Panasonic. The cleaning cycle / charging cycle is intuitive and easy to use. This is a definite investment and something I will be using for many years. The price is serious for this kind of article, but there is no doubt that you're buying quality, for an article that you will use every day and really has to be reliable.",5
2055,"This is a very nice electric shaver from Braun, but I would expect it to be for the price. I have tried many electric shavers in my adult life with varying degrees of success. Generally I prefer the three rotating head variety of shaver but I have to say that this is the best foil type shaver I have ever used, and this definitely gives the closest shave of any electric shaver I have tried, either wet or dry, although I personally find that nothing shaves as close as a blade.The shaver itself is well made. robust and fits comfortably in my hand. I have no idea what the SynchroSonic technology actually does but I know that it doesn't make it very quiet. Overall though I does a pretty good job.",5
2056,This is a very well priced and best ever kids tablets. It makes me happy to know my daughter is watching only things suitable for her. To Amazon for this I can't speak highly enough. What an amazing amazing device. My daughter loves this. Best Christmas present ever.It's not perfect device in terms of specs but that is complimented by it fit for purpose for kids.What fantastic value for money.,5
2057,"this is a well designed and engineered tool which works cleanly and efficiently. Brilliant shaver, very quiet and very effective",5
2058,"This is a well designed and engineered tool which works cleanly and efficiently.When I fist looked I could not find any reference to a trimmer, but I can confirm that it has one and it works well.Replacement cleaning fluid is far too expensive. I find that flushing through the cutting head under the hot tap and then using a few drops of Bio Oil on the foil after drying works just fine.",5
2059,This is absolutely brilliant,5
2060,This is amazing so good in fact that I have trouble getting my kids up in the morning as they think it's still night.,5
2061,This is amazing. Since I bought it I've had the best sleep because my kids are having the best sleep too... The design is lovely. It's easy to put up and holds well. I highly recommend this to all parents.,5
2062,This is amazing.Will be buying more,5
2063,This is an absolutely brilliant little item. Easy to 'fit' and it allows me to have charger lead in whilst in use ( my old beanbag-style one didn't and this caused major problems on long journeys ). Fabulous value for money!,5
2064,"This is an awesome product!  I have been using the Braun 790cc for a few years and decided to treat myself to a new shaver, and so I went for the Braun 9 9095CC.Just used it for the first time on a two day old beard.  I was totally impressed by how smooth and good it felt.  I could not feel it cutting any hair at all; no pulling of stray longer hairs, no irritation of the skin, and it produced a vary close shave.  It even did a good job of the notorious under the chin areas.It's pretty quiet too, as is the cleaning station when it's doing its stuff.The head is slightly larger than the 790CC but not in a cumbersome way, and the shaver itself looks sleek, though the ""chrome"" look is plastic rather than metal.Comes with a little hard travel case, a small brush, a cleansing station and 1 cleaning cartridge.One reviewer wrote that Braun no longer sell accessories for this shaver. What a load of rubbish!  On the Braun UK site you'll see accessories for this.  Why on earth would they not sell accessories for one of their newest models and yet sell them for the older versions?So, if you are looking for a good shaver that does a close and comfortable shave, then this is the one for you.I got mine from Argos purely because it was the same price as Amazon's and I wouldn't have had to pay for delivery (I'm not a Prime subscriber).  At £110 below the MRP it's a bargain.",5
2065,"This is an expensive purchase but OMG does it do the job!  I have a pretty heavy beard growth.  Even a 3 day growth is no match for this beast.  My previous was the top of the line Phillips which was fine until I needed a replacement shaver head.  Since then, shaving has been a 20 - 25 minute affair. And no - it WAS a genuine Phillips head before you troll me .. :)Shaving is now back to a sub 5 min task for me now.  The shaver itself is a bit bling for my taste buy hey - it works exceptionally well!",5
2066,"This is best shave I have ever had with an electric shaver. Yes, it is as close as a blade but you won't cut yourself using it. It feels completely smooth on your face. I've previously been a fan of rotary shavers but no more. For this reason alone it is worth buying, if you can afford it: it's a top of the range shaver at a top of the range price.However that isn't all. The trimmer is very good and easy to use. It charges in an hour as it says in specs. You can clean it under running water which probably prolongs the life rather than just giving it a brush but it is fiddly. Or you can use the clean and charge unit which is even more fiddly but probably a good idea if you aren't in a hurry.And the manual is nice and clear with actual words as well as pictures which I find more comprehensible -I'm a printed word man.Basically if you want the best electric shaver ever, here it is.",5
2067,This is brilliant - it literally works on any window and you can use it to part of full block out light 0 it was brilliant over summer and takes no space up when not needed - no installation required - cannot recommend enough,5
2068,"This is brilliant and worth the money, my daughter loves it",5
2069,This is brilliant take it everywhere. Makes room pitch black darker than home and is why daughter sleeps so well when travel. Essential for us.,5
2070,"This is brilliant value for money, it's a great size and it works very well as a black out, and comes with a very handy bag!",5
2071,This is brilliant! I have a large bay window and its more than enough to cover it worh good suction cups very pleased thank you,5
2072,This is brilliant. Never knew these existed until I saw it on here. Now I'm sleeping too much.Perfect to go with the projecter and screens on here.,5
2073,This is brilliantly small and useful. Easy to use and doesn't block screen view.  Excellent.,5
2074,"This is bringing a lot of pleasure to my 9 yr old grandson. The only criticism I have that for someone nearly 10 the videos and games are a bit young, but it is  Easy to down load games on my account and transfer over so no problem. Also took the blue protector off, great for little ones but not for big boys.Great serviceHighly recommendG",5
2075,"This is by no means a cheap solution, but it really does keep all the light out and mine has never once fallen down.",5
2076,This is exactly what I was looking for. I had a similar one that I left in a courtesy car so needed a replacement. This one is better because both sides expand making it easier to place and remove the phone with one hand.,5
2077,This is fab... our boys love it! Perfect...,5
2078,"This is fab....my ‘baby’ works nights and this makes summer days like night and really helps with catch up sleep.....brilliant idea, we’ll produced. Definitely recommend for babies of all ages!",5
2079,"This is fabulous!  We use it everywhere!! Nice size, totally blocks out light and my little one sleeps much better with it up.",5
2080,"This is fantastic got it for my 2 year old granddaughter as she loves u tube but there are even kids things I don't want her watching as it was encouraging her to do the same naughty things ( I'm by no means a saint) but these were the sort of things you wouldn't want a 2 year old to see, but now her mum and dad have total control of what is suitable. My granddaughter loves it thank you for an amazing kids tablet.",5
2081,"This is fantastic, my 3 year old isn't getting up at the crack of dawn anymore! The way it adapts to any window is brilliant and I've had no problems with the suction cups. Highly recommended!!",5
2082,This is fantastic! My son lives it and tbh so do I as can do everything on this little tablet too. The kindle fire for kids app is great too he can watch and play so many things. I was lucky I got on offer as I sadly want to buy one for my sister and the price had gone back up.The only down side is the speaker sounds as though it has blown for somethings,5
2083,This is great does everything a iPad does without the price and the cover is excellent I can see why they offer a free replacement with this product it would be a challenge to break it in the kids case!,5
2084,this is great granddaughter very happy.,5
2085,"This is great to take travelling for hire cars as it's small and light. It fits the airvents of most cars but we have found it doesn't fit Minis! So it might be hit and miss, but a good buy for taking abroad.",5
2086,"This is great, probably especially in summer with the early sunrise. The suction pads are strong and the separate panels enable you to use as much or as little of the blackout material as you need. The dawn wake-up calls have stopped and we are all back to sleeping through.",5
2087,This is great.,5
2088,This is great. It can be folded and secured onto windows of many size and rolls up into a small bag for easy carrying.,5
2089,"This is just perfect, easy to use Great to be able to monitor what he is using it for and great that I can use it for reading when he has gone to bed!!",5
2090,This is more than just a piece of black cloth. The velcro system and arrangement of suckers mean that it is possible to almost totally black out any window in just a few minutes.The suckers stay stuck to the glass and the material feels of a very good quality and lets no light through at all. Easy to fold up into the supplied carrying bag.,5
2091,"This is my 'go to' baby shower gift. Everyone loves it, it comes in so handy for people traveling with children.",5
2092,This is my 4 year old sons first tablet and it is fantastic for him to learn how to use and also learning more.,5
2093,"This is my 4th or 5th Braun shaver - they get better with every new series.Obviously, this cuts even better than the previous 8 series of shavers.  The addition of the 4th row of cutters with different properties, means that the problem of stray hairs on the neck has mostly gone away.But the icing on the cake is that it is a lot quieter than all the others!  So now its possible to CONTINUE listening to the news or a podcast in the morning, even while you are shaving :-)",5
2094,"This is my first Braun, after having owned a high-end model from a competitor for a few years. I'm quite happy with the purchase.  I've had it for about 6 weeks now, and I think this is the best razor I've owned, and the shave is actually as good as with my Mach 4 razors.",5
2095,"This is my initial review of this shaver.Firstly some background,  over the years I've used a variety of electric razors and wet shaved as well.  For the electric I've always been a massive fan of phillishave and had plenty of them,  including some of the top of the line models with gel packs and cleaning bays etc. The only foil shavers I've used in the past 10 have been a recent Wahl model and a couple of cheap braun travel models. Never been that impressed,  with these but they are obviously a different class of device.So to look at the 9095c. On unpacking it doesn't look great value,  lightweight plastic cleaning Base,  a cartridge of cleaning fluid to slot into it,  a shrink wrapped power lead and a zipped up case.  On opening the case to reveal the shaver and small brush the impression of quality and value changes. I've never held a shaver that felt so solid in my hand. Looked and felt fantastic.Shaver battery was completely discharged so I inserted the cartridge into the case and then put the shaver on the Base and plugged it in. I left it for 4 hours but I think it charged well inside that time. You can also plug the lead into the shaver directly if you didn't want to take the cleaning unit and were travelling.Then it was time to try it.....  Sadly enough I had watched a youtube video  and the performance looked brilliant so expectations were high.And I have to say with 2 days growth that this unit gave me quite possibly the best dry shave I have ever had and also one of the quickest. Holding it at a 90 degree angle to my face it was like a lawn mower as it took away the beard. Seriously the result was amazing.I've used it again this morning and again 30 seconds to tidy it up and done,  brilliant.The unit tells you when it needs cleaning but I did a manual one after the first use to lubricate and clean it and although this took a while and was quite noisy it completed fine and the head was immaculate this morning. I would suggest not cleaning it as you go to bed if you have an ensuite bathroom as the cleaning can disturb a light sleeper.  This would be fine after a morning shave though so not a problem at all.You can use the unit with shaving gel and also in the shower,  I will add to this review once I've tried both and if I run into any problems.Overall though this is a quality product and I can't think of anyway that I could have got a better shave.Simply excellent.",5
2096,"This is my second Braun shaver ,the previous one being 795cc. I use the 795cc at home and carry the 9095cc during my trips abroad.",5
2097,"This is my second electric shaver. First one was Phillips something rotary with three round blades with three threads on each blade. Phillips was good and lasted for 3 years with my type of beard as you can see from the photos. I always had this type of beard for the last 10 years.Now the Braun. First impression was good when opened the box. The Shaver has rubberized grip which makes it nice to touch and hold. As per the photos attached you can see my type of beard before and after shaving. Average time for shaving for me is 5 min (was using stop watch 4 times).I was shaving exactly after 48 hours as after that I am sure the shaver will start pull the hairs out making me to use a lot of swearing words so even my neighbours would come to see what is going on. Also, you can see the photos of the shaver`s head after I rinsed it under the hot water tap. I did not use the station to get it cleaned yet but as you can see rinsing under the running hot water does good job anyways. The shaver will not work when plugged into the power through power adapter as the one I have is for WET and DRY shaving and this is I guess is for safety reasons.The Trimmer is a joke. I guess at ""Braun"", quality check was done by somebody who does not use the trimmer, hahaha. Basically it is sh....t and I am not using it.My only hope on this shaver is to last me for 2-3 years and then I will change it again.",5
2098,"This is one of the best electronic shaver I've ever bought from Braun. I have been hawing 3, 7 series and the 9 series is just outstanding.",5
2099,This is our second gro blind. We have had the first for six years and use it so much for our 6.5 year old. Now our 4 year old needs this to avoid 5am wake ups on holiday! It is now even better quality.,5
2100,"This is perfect for both my phone and my sat nav. I bought two, one for me and one for my son and we are both pleased with them. Excellent value for money and promptly delivered.",5
2101,"This is perfect for what I needed, the sun was waking me up at 4.45am but after putting this up I was able to sleep in for much longer! Great for most sized windows and blacks out perfectly.",5
2102,"This is perfect, all the apps, books & puzzles you'll need, £2 a month after the 12 months is a bargain, not to mention the 2 year worry free, YouTube kids was easy to install, this is for Xmas so only tested by myself, very pleased with purchase",5
2103,This is perfect. It fits in the fan and can be turned to face any direction. It seems robust. Does the job perfectly.,5
2104,"This is quite possibly THE BEST universal, vent mounted, mobile device holder I have ever owned.  I first saw this in a friends car and I was impressed with how secure it was during a drive, so I got one.I have been using this for about a week now and I'm still thrilled with it.  So many of these ""universal mounts"" are not built for purpose and after a bump in the raod they fall out or the phone will slowly slip out.  Not the case with this.  I am using a Samsung S7, and this MPOW grips it tightly.  The sides are spring loaded and have a soft foam cushion so it grips, yet doesn't scratch the handset. The vent munt at the back is a decent quality rubber.  I can give it a firm push into the vent and it is as if I have glued the phone to the center console.  It really is great.I am forever travelling using google maps and now I can see the roads and road names safely without looking at the passenger seat where it used to lay",5
2105,"This is right up my child's street, she loves it but not the time restrictions we have put in place.",5
2106,This is simple but good product. I did/do have problems with the left clip coming off a lot but it does snap back easily.,5
2107,"This is such a breakthrough.  If Miele make the 'Rolls Royce of appliances', this shaver is certainly a high endauto in comparison.There are certain areas of my face (on the right side, and I'm left-handed) that are tricky to get smooth.  This shaver, with a larger head akin to a ride-on lawn mower makes short work of it and I've even started to shave every other day if a late night has dictated it.The Clean & Charge unit is quieter than previous models.  The only downside is that replacement foil/cutter units are apparently £50 which is A LOT.  Otherwise, can't recommend this highly enough.",5
2108,This is such a brilliant product and so easy to use.  I use it in our baby's bedroom at home and also always take it when going away.  I haven't had any issues with the suction cups as some reviews have stated.,5
2109,This is the 2nd one I orders in last 5 years! I still have the first one but needed another one for another room! Dunno what I would do without it.,5
2110,"this is the 2nd one i've bought (for other car), works very well I would highly recommend",5
2111,"This is the 3rd Braun Electric Shaver that I have used over the last 15-20 years.  Yes, they're expensive, but they have lasted me well and I have had no complaints about the reliability of these excellent shavers.  Prior to using the Braun devices I used a Philips, but decided to change, not because I was unhappy with the Philips, but because I fancied a change and had heard good things about the Braun shavers.How does this compare to my older 7 Series - well the shaving head is larger and it is a lot quieter in the noise department.  Some people have made comment upon the quality of the plastics being poor.  Comparing this to my older (and still working 7 Series), yes the plastics are different - maybe its because this is a wet & dry model and the plastics have been made for using in/under water?  I don't know.  But from my point of view, all that counts is the closeness of the shave - I'm very happy indeed.  The shaving head allows for a very close shave, closer the my old 7 Series, so yes it is Braun's closest shaver (from my experience); I can accept the feel of the plastics to be different and time will see if they last as long as my other Braun models.In sum, I managed to purchase this during the Amazon Easter Special sale and got it at a much reduced price.  At £199.99 it is well worth the cost and a definite purchase from my point of view.  However, at the RRP of £329.99 I wouldn't purchase it - yes it probably is worth that amount (considering that I've had my old 7 Series for about 5 years and it hasn't failed me once), but when you consider that a replacement head costs £50 and Braun recommend that you replace the head every 18-months, over a 5yr timeframe you could be paying >£480!!!! nearly £100 per year to dry shave.  That doesn't include the cost of replacing the cleaning refills @ £5 per refill per month. Ouch!",5
2112,This is the best air vent phone holder I've used so far!,5
2113,This is the best choice for every men no doubt. my older Braun 799CC was good but 9095CC is fantastic. smooth shaving,5
2114,"This is the best shaver i have ever used. Honestly, if you want a close shave that does not irritate your skin then this is the one you need to buy. It gives an equally goos shave whether you use the wet or the dry function. It is brilliant and just glides over the contors of your face. Really happy with this product. There is not one down side to this item, it even holds its charge fantasticly well.",5
2115,This is the best shawer ever,5
2116,"This is the fourth Braun Shaver I have owned and it produces a result thatis as close to using a cut-throat as seems humanly possible!If Braun can produce anything approaching or improving on this Series 9they will have achieved a miracle.Expensive, but worth every penny/cent!!!",5
2117,"This is the newest top of the range razor from Braun. It is also at least the fifth I've owned from them so I've been able to see how they've progressed over time.Firstly, this is as always an excellent razor. You'll never get as close as a wet shave, but it will certainly do a respectable job. This new unit has an extra 'awkward hair' cutting strip in the middle, one more than the previous model. It goes through my three day stubble with ease, whereas the last 7 series shaver often need a couple of attempts. You can lock the head in place, or allow it to move as you use it. I generally let it move about as the shaving foil surface is huge and its hard to keep constant contact otherwise.Getting a clean shave takes maybe a minute or two. I don't use it in the shower as a 'wet' shaver as it just doesn't do the trick for me.In the hand it does feel much lighter than the old model and the build quality is excellent. The new cleaning dock is very snazzy and uses the same clean & renew cartridges as the last one. I really do feel that the dock is an important component, yes you can clean off the shaver head under the tap, but it gets much cleaner with the dock.If it's been a particularly sweaty week (like the heatwave we've had recently) then I have noticed I get significantly reduced skim blemishes and irritation if I clean the shaver unit regularly. I would imagine you get a bacterial build up on the shaver over time, that the cleaning unit, well, cleans.The only real sticking point for me is the beard/precision trimmer. On the 7 series this used to pop up from the front, whereas on the new shaver it slides up from the back with much less clearance from the shaving unit. It's not the end of the world, but does make things a bit more unwieldy.Overall this is still a fantastic razor. However the top of the range 7 series shaver is a bit cheaper and does 95% of the job (the only thing it misses is the 3 day stubble).Well recommended.",5
2118,This is the only unit that I have found that fits my vents and stays on (they are curved),5
2119,This is the second blind we've bought - perfect!,5
2120,This is the second Mpow phone holder I've bought and both fit the air vents on our two cars perfectly.I did consider getting a magnetic holder but read reviews about them reducing the phone's battery and didn't want to risk it.,5
2121,"This is the second one we bought, this one for our own bedroom as we were quite jealous of lo's lovely dark room. It's brilliant, easy to adjust, actually sticks to the windows and makes a huge difference in brightness of the room.",5
2122,This is the second one! My son likes it.,5
2123,This is the secound one we have had as this is a bigger version than the one we had previously. My son love this and takes it everywhere with him as the apps are very good.,5
2124,"This is truly a black out blind. We bought this when the lighter evenings started, although we already have blackout lining in the curtains our daughters room was still too light. This blackout blind is amazing. Pitch dark and she sleeps early at night and doesn't wake until she should in the morning. It will be coming with us when we go on holiday too. Worth the money",5
2125,This is very good product for the price. Fits well in the air vent (BMW 7 Series & Peugeot 308). The holder doesn't shake while driving even over speed humps. It holds the phone well and has fallen off yet.,5
2126,This is wonderful. Exceeded my expectations. Grandson loves it. Still working out what can be done. Has content but had to sign up for Fire for kids unlimited to get everything he likes and age appropriate . Like that he cannot access Internet. Totally controlled by parents,5
2127,This is worth every penny got at bargain price aswell so pleased I kept watch on Amazon!,5
2128,This item is excellent in ensuring light does not come through allowing children not to wake up to early during summer months.,5
2129,"This item is fantastic!  I cannot believe that I did not buy this sooner.  Last summer my daughter kept waking earlier and earlier as the lighter mornings came in and it was horrible waking at 5am every day!  Since buying this she is now sleeping till 8 am or until I wake her which is fantastic!!  It is a touch awkward to stick to the window and adjust to fit, but not impossible, and it is well worth the effort as the benefits are great!",5
2130,This item is perfect for my windows 10 950xl. It holds very well I was surprised how good this item is. It's much better than the suction type and more convenient on the vent than on the screen,5
2131,"This little device, combined with the Waze app, has made my morning 90 mile commute almost pleasurable.  Fits nicely onto my 5 series vent, doesn't rattle and holds the iphone 7plus securely.  Doesn't look tacky when the phone is off either.  I'm going to order a couple more for my other cars.  I also took it on holiday to France recently to use in the rental car.",5
2132,"This little thing is a beauty and one of my favourite phone holders for the car. It's just so small and compact it doesn't take up and space and it also can easily attach to any vent as it is designed to, meaning you can set it in different places depending on the individual users needs.It securely holds your phone in place as the arms on each end extend to encase your phone, then you just pop it into the vent and you are good to go. It also allows you to turn it a bit so don't worry if you put it in and your phone is upside down, just simply turn it around the right direction.This is currently still attached to the vent in my car :)",5

2134,"This model is much better than my old one series 7, absolutely love it, game changer for me.",5
2135,This product has been so useful for our family. We got this as we were going travelling and it proved a lifesaver for naps and getting the children recovered from jet lag providing a deep dark room for them to sleep comfortably in. Has so far fitted all windows we have attempted and is easy to use and keeps its quality well. Staying at family houses has also led to this being used and we have once again been very glad to have it especially over the summer months when it was still sunny at bedtime. Overall very happy.,5
2136,"This product is amazing! The material is really good quality and does the job! Was larger than our window, yet was easily reduced in size due to the Velcro. Stuck to the window really well, with no problems. Quick delivery! Would definitely recommend this product.",5
2137,"This product is brilliant! I originally bought theAmeda Purely Yours Lactaline Double Electric Breast Pump which was rubbish! This doesn’t leak, it also allows you to have different settings which is useful and unique to each person.It’s very easy to use and put together, the sterilising is also simple. The bottles are great as well, my baby took to them straight away where as others she hasn’t.I would highly recommend this product!",5
2138,This product is brilliant. I have previously made one of these with blackout material but it is nowhere near as good as this. It blocks out most of the light and is easy to put up.,5
2139,"This product is excellent. Very small and discreet, fits perfectly on the car vent. Great delivery service, was delivered the next day (with prime).Strong and sturdy, this phone holder fits my iPhone 6 perfectly. Doesn't move whilst the car is in motion. Much better than the phone holder that stick to the dashboard or windscreen.I have been searching, which seems like a lifetime, for a phone holder that actually works as it should and I have finally found it.Would recommend this product to anyone searching for a reliable and good-looking phone holder for the car.",5
2140,This product is really useful and have been using it for a while. Can't fault it at all. Does it's job as stated.,5
2141,"This product is so simple, yet incredibly effective!Using suckers to stick to the glass it covers the whole window making baby's room nice and dark, which is great for the long summer nights and very bright mornings.",5
2142,"This product is the best purchase so fare. Have tried a manual pump but that took for ever and a day to get one once. After doing lots of research on electric pumps, I decided to purchase this one. I read that it doesn't hurt, so I put it on full blast (OUCH!!!) don't put on full, ease yourself into it! Luckily I also had Lansinoh nipple cream, which I would also recommend, it is expensive but worth it. Product is slightly noisy, but put a cloth underneath and this solves the problem.",5
2143,This product looks really good and I'd love to keep it but unfortunately it is unsuitable for my windows. I have small window panes above large ones.  The suckers are too large to stick to the window frames.  When I put the suckers on the panes light is allowed in down the sides. No good! Reluctantly returned..,5
2144,This pump is easy to use and effective. It has a plug for home use but also takes batteries if you want to express whilst out. I like the fact that I can change the suction either and the let down feature is very effective. I would highly recommend it.,5
2145,This pump is fantastic and works well as it can be plugged into the mains s well as used with batteries. The letdown function is very affective and can be used at any time whilst pumping. It is also very comfy and has very good suction. The only thing I found difficult were the instructions as they are very small and if you have never pumped before they don't give you a lot of advice. Also somewhere to store it would be great.,5
2146,"This razor comes nicely boxed with a zipped case to keep it in, a small bottle of lubricant for the foils as well as a cleaning brush and charger cable. Charging the razor is quick, needing only about an hour and ten minutes for a full charge. There is a charge indicator light which shows you (by way of 5 bars that light up) how much power the razor has. A full charge will give you approximately 50 minutes of cordless shaving. As usual the charger has a 2 pin plug.On the razor itself, the on/off button is central on the front curve of the handle. The handle fits nicely into the hand and the swivel head makes it much easier to get into all the little cracks and crevices of the face and get a good shave. You can lock the head into a choice of 5 positions for more detailed work and there is a trimmer for longer hair (such as sideburns) stored on the back of the razor which can be released and slid upwards for ease of use. Its much quieter than other razors I have had. Not having spent as much as this on any previous razor, I can honestly say that its the best shave that I've had and I won't be going back to the cheaper versions.Its not complicated to operate and the written and pictorial starting instructions in the booklet are clear - it takes very little time to get the razor on charge and then to use it.",5
2147,This saved us on holiday as we forgot our normal blackout blinds! We ordered one which arrived the next day - perfect.It is great -it fitted the window fantastically and didn't let any light in.  It has suckers all the way around to put the blind in place.  You can make the blind smaller by folding the blind and holding together by the already attached velcro strips.Highly recommended and worth every penny!,5
2148,"This shaver is excellent, offers the closest shave with a dry electric razor I've ever had. Would highly recommend to men with a heavy growth, this shaver had no issues cutting through 2-3 days of growth. The cleaning dock is excellent and cleans all the hair from your shaver and even dries it for you. Five stars.",5
2149,"This shaver is really top of the range and, as you would expect, comes in a pretty large box and with a few ‘extras.’ In all you get the Series 9 (this model is 9095cc) shaver, a clean and charge station with one cleaning cartridge, a smartplug, a cleaning brush and a leather pouch to house the shaver when travelling.My initial impression was that it looked great – although obviously that is not of prime importance, but it is sleek, silver and certainly feels quite sturdy. A full charge will give up to 50 minutes of cordless shaving time, so easily enough for a few days away (there is also a travel lock to stop the shaver starting by accident if you pack it), and the shaver display will show the charge status when it is connected and flash red when running low. There is also a cleaning indicator, which lights up when the shaver needs to be cleaned in the Clean and Charge station. Now it is worth mentioning that you can clean manually – there is a small brush included and you can clean it under tap water, in between using the cleaning station. The shaver does come with one cleaning cartridge and this needs to be replaced after about 3 weeks if you use it daily and after about 8 weeks if you use it less often. Obviously, the cost of replacing them will change, but you can check the cost of refills and decide for yourself. The cleaning station will keep the shaver clean and hygienic, although it is quite noisy!Most important is the actual function of the razor. My husband had not shaved over the weekend and so had thick stubble, but this was quick and comfortable to use. He liked the side trimmer and was very impressed with how easy this was to use. The shaver head has five positions, which you need to change and let it click into position. Obviously, this takes a little getting used to, but he found it simple to use and I was impressed with how smooth his skin was once he had shaved. It gives a precise shave, the trimmer is useful for sideburns or if you have a moustache, it gives fifty minutes cordless shaving, has a travel pouch and travel lock and the cleaning system is excellent (although the refills are a little expensive). Overall, an excellent electric razor and it looks great too.",5
2150,"This shaver is stunning, I was really split between buying the Philips 9031/26 and the Braun 9095cc; both are the top line models. It's exceptionally hard to find reviews that compare the two and in the end the Braun edged it because the Philips had a separate, detachable sideburn trimmer that I didn't want floating around and getting lost. I am not disappointed.Until recently I'd been happily using my trusty Philips Arcitec rotary shaver, after 7 years of service it suddenly gave up the ghost a few weeks ago and since then as a temporary measure I've been using a Gilette Fusion Pro Gilde bladed shaver. Other reviews seem to suggest that the Braun 9095 can't match a bladed wet shave but in my case that's absolute nonsense, the Braun more than matches the bladed razor and 8 hours after having a wet shave with the Braun I can't feel any stubble coming through. In fact the Braun is the closest shave I've had in my 20+ years of shaving, it's stupendous. I've got skin that is very sensitive so I doubt I would ever use the Braun as a dry shave but with shaving gel or cream I've had absolutely no irritation whatsoever, quite an achievement for a product that's dealing with a face that could be kindly described as angular.I feel like Braun should possibly be paying me for this review but no money has changed hands and I'm not one of those lucky folks who get the products for free; I didn't however pay anywhere near the price quoted on Amazon and managed to get it from Costco online instead for way cheaper.I can't praise the shaver enough apart from one thing, as other reviewers have picked up on the sideburn trimmer isn't up to a huge amount, it's no problem for me as my sideburns need a daily trim and it easily copes with that but I can see how someone with an achingly trendy beard might not get on with it as well.Some reviewers have mentioned about the fact the plastic on the shaver is shiny and tacky - it's fine and for a shaver this good isn't worth getting het up about. I think it looks rather smart and I'm not into bling.The only thing that isn't made clear and you might get confused about is that some reviews are contradictory about whether this shaver can be used with foam/gel/cream - it can but before it's put in the cleaning station it has to be rinsed off in hot water to avoid clogging the cleanse cartridge with gunk. One other thing, the cleansing station isn't noisy in the slightest, you can hear it operating but chances are your toilet flushing, shower or extractor fan will out-noise it.Ultimately this is a top quality shaver, it's quick and it leaves your skin feeling smoother than ever. I don't think I've ever been so pleased with a purchase; the downside is that my wife thinks I'm a little peculiar for constantly stroking my own face. I'd love to see if the Philips 9031/26 can equal this but I think I've found shaver heaven already.",5
2151,"This shaver represents the pinnacle of electric shaving at this point in time, as it should given the price.I suffer with sensitive skin and often cut even with an electric razor. (I normally use Braun). My first point is that the series 9 is the most comfortable electric shave yet, no cutting, glides effortlessly, it's quiet and at the end my skin is remarkably smooth and well shaved. It works extremely well and if you can afford the hefty price tag the quality of shave alone I think is worth it.The battery has a decent charge span and the build quality is superb. It fits well in the hand and is nice to hold.Next is the clean and charge station, this is a feature I've used for years and love about Braun razors. You have a base station that accepts a cartridge filled with a blue cleaning liquid that smells of surgical spirit. You just stand the razor in the station and it lights up, analyses the state of your razor and selects the appropriate cleaning cycle. One press of the button and it cleans you razor immaculately whilst simultaneously charging the battery. A replacement cartridge costs about £12.00 for a box of 3, or roughly £4.00 each.I go through around 6 a year.I have used top of the line Braun razors for many years and never has even one broken down. They are built like a JCB digger, rugged and tough and will give their owner many years of trouble free shaving. There are cheaper versions out there but they do have different shaving heads that I don't find are as effective as the series 9. Expensive yes, but a great shaver.",5
2152,"This shaver works absolutely brilliantly when used wet with a foaming gel shaving product, or better still with a non-foaming, cooling gel. The result is smooth and comfortable. A three-day beard is dispatched quickly and efficiently and one shave easily lasts me all day. A couple of times during a shave I run the cutting head under hand-hot water with the motor running to clear the blades before continuing. I don't know if this is necessary but the water runs away easily out of the cutting head after rinsing and doesn't drip everywhere when I return to shaving.A dry shave matches using the shaver with foam, as long as the skin is dry. The instructions say ""shave before washing"" and indeed I found that the shave is very close to using the unit wet but if my skin is damp the results are less good.The tilting head is a nice feature that allows the shaver to glide effortlessly over facial contours and it can also be locked in a number of fixed positions, if required. Only relatively gentle pressure is required for a close shave and it did not give me shaver burn. The curved sides to the foils mean that this shaver doesn't shave right into the 'corner' between my top lip and nose, but there is of course the trimmer attachment to deal with that.",5
2153,This tablet is excellent and educational for little kids. It helps your child to delovop learning everyday,5
2154,"This tablet is perfect for my 5 year old with loads of easy access apps and activities and I'm confident that the content is safe. Battery life is very good, start up is fast and the display and audio are both excellent. The case does the job and the kindle will bounce if dropped.

2160,"This was a Christmas gift for my brother,he thinks it's a brilliant shaver!!!!",5
2161,This was a shaver to replace my 5 year old 3rd series Braun shaver. Its like night and day. Superb quality shaver! Shaves even a two day beard very well. Battery holds very well. Went on holiday several times and never needed to recharge it untill i returned. The cleaning station is a god's given gift. Its amazing.. If you are unsure which shaver to buy - buy this braun. If you don't like braun - buy it atill. This is the king of shavers.,5
2162,This was supplied in excellent condition and has been fitted to my spare room where we put our grand daughter for afternoon kips. This has been a valuable item which has helped her to sleep midday.,5
2163,This works brilliantly. Like the fact that you can adjust the size. Suction cups work well contrary to what I had read on other reviews. A brilliant idea.,5
2164,this works really well,5

2168,Timely delivery of these lovely boxed earrings which although quite small are really sparkling!,5
2169,"Tiny, delicate and just what I was looking for.",5
2170,"To start off with – I actually like the design of the product from Braun, it's large, but has quite a classic look to it, and Braun have always been ahead of the game in terms of design for me anyway, so this continues that trend. The materials in use add up to a very solid and good quality shaver.The foil wet shave was the first I tried, and I have to say it is the closest foil shave I have ever had, only my wet shave blade razor achieves a closer one, and that isn't to count against this one at all. The dry shave is just as good, but I find I have to go over areas sometimes once more to get the same shave as the wet achieved, though this may be because I don't have the densest beard growth, and nothing like a shadow. It is also a comfortable shave – unlike older foil rotary head shavers I've owned in the past the Braun doesn't leave my skin feeling raw afterwards, even without moisturiser. Though to keep up a shave this close would obviously require you to change the head every six months – like Braun suggest.I also have no problem cleaning the shaving head myself, and I think this is a fine option rather than spending the extra for the model with the cleaning station.Overall I'd say this is the best foil shaver I have ever owned, it obviously won't prompt me to bin my standard razors, but I really am impressed with this, and will be my go-to travel shaver from now on.",5
2171,"took seconds to fit up, no problem with suckers, bed room now pitch black, as a night worker these light mornings didn't help. but now no problem ZZZZZ.",5
2172,"Top bit of kit, smooth shave with minimum fuss.",5
2173,Top drawer. Ideal for the younger kids. Our 4YO loves it. The Kids app is great,5
2174,top nothc,5
2175,totally brilliant. perfect for the kids aged 6 and 3. easy to set up. Great answer for non tecchie parents who want to ensure kids have an internet safe experience.,5
2176,"Totally sleep saver and easy to put up and take down, we put it up in the summer and our baby immediately stopped getting up at funny hours. We still put it up every night now to block out the street light.As the weather is getting colder, the condensation is getting worse in the morning so it is best to air the blind every day to avoid mold growing.",5
2177,Travel essential!,5
2178,Tried it out as is a Christmas present for my daughter.I have now purchased myself one minus Amazon kids :),5
2179,"UPDATE: Tried it for the first time last night, and I am thrilled to say, it is now 10am and my son is still asleep! No light is waking him! Fantastic!!!Took my a minute to figure out how to make it smaller, but when I got past that hurdle it was incredibly simple to use, baby's room is now pitch black just how he likes it!",5
2180,"upgraded my daughter from a very old and broken iPad.case and device are a good build qualityThe child wrapper works well for my 6 year old and helps navigate her to things that are relevant for her.For the difference in money to an iPad its a no-brainer to explore the Kindle.As per my other review the camera is not as good as an iPad but the fact you can add your own SD card to then download lots of content for them on the road/planes is a major plus against the iPad at a fraction of the cost. Getting the charging cable into the device is not a easy as the iPad but its still not difficult!You get access to the child content for a year then need to subscribe, so far based on my daughter usage i would plan to continue with this (£1.99/month if i recall) after the subscription ends after a year.",5
2181,use it to hold my sat nav it works really well. just grab sat nav by width not length,5
2182,"Use it to shave my head, used to use new gillette mach 3's every other day, but can now use this for 5-10 mins in the morning instead. Much quicker and less irritation. Was a lot to pay out but when your paying £12 for 4 blades, and using 1 every 2 days this will soon pay for itself as well as being much quicker and easier to use.",5
2183,Use this all the time and we put it up in summer months as a double black out to prevent early mornings!,5
2184,Used Braun shavers for 25 years and this is the best and gives a very close clean shave.,5
2185,"Used for my 7 and 4 year old children. Has great features, very child friendly and easy to use.",5
2186,"Used this for he first time yesterday after exclusively breastfeeding my 5 week old bub. Really easy to clean, assemble and use. Comfortable - I was nervous about how it would feel but it's absolutely fine. The let down function is great, I used it twice in one session and it did increase my flow a second time. Took me about 10 minutes to get 80ml and this morning I pumped from both sides filling up almost a whole bottle. Being a first time mum I would really recommend this to anyone wanting to pump- so easy!",5
2187,used this for my Samsung s7 at first when I tried fixing this it on my air vents i struggled as i have a audi a3 the air vents are round but after the second try i successfully did it and up to now my phone stays in place,5
2188,"Used this on Holiday for my son - Absolutely brilliant, he had more sleep than in his bed at home!Easy to put up and cancels out all light from the window",5
2189,"Used this recently on holiday in a caravan. Was able to make it small enough for the window and stuck well, if i'd had more time I could've made it look neater but it did the job wonderfully, plus I could still open the window to air the room without removing it. Would highly recommend.",5
2190,"Useful for any car, as it fits on your heater/AC vents. Very handy to clip my smartphone to, enabling me to use the Apple Maps app as a satnav device.",5
2191,Useful for caravan,5
2192,User friendly a bit slow but it is for children,5
2193,Using different models of Braun shavers since 2008. One shaver runs for years just bought latest because I was desperate to get new model otherwise old shaver was doing perfect job. Braun Series 9 amazed me after first shave. Definitely would recommend this.,5
2194,Using it for my Mazda 2. Perfect fit and the material does not feel cheap.,5
2195,"Using this in my VW Golf, fits perfectly and holds the phone securely. I like how small and unobtrusive this holder is.",5
2196,V good.,5
2197,v/good value,5
2198,Verry verry good,5
2199,"Very  pretty  indeed. Arrived on time, haven’t worn them yet but will be wearing soon. One confusing thing is the little piece of plastic on each end of them, will prob remove when wearing.",5
2200,Very beautiful earrings !! Just as I was expecting,5
2201,"VERY big, I use it as a curtain in my windows by folding over the fabric. It's very good.",5
2202,very classy. Great value for money.,5
2203,Very delicate and pretty,5
2204,Very easily just slides onto air vent.  Holds phone nice and snugly. Basically does what it says on the tin!,5
2205,"Very easy to attach to vent, it just clips in. The clip has a nice rubber coating, adding to the grip. The phone locks in securely, just pull out the arms to fit it in. I've had no instances where it moved or slipped at all. I was concerned that my phone might be too heavy for the small holder (I have a big phone, a Oneplus Three) but have not had any issues at all.It is very small, so not noticeable on the car vent when the phone is not docked.Would definitely recommend this product.",5
2206,"very easy to fit,. very good product helps kids sleep longer",5
2207,Very easy to install just fits to the air vent. Perfect,5
2208,Very easy to mount,5
2209,Very easy to mount and use and very neat,5
2210,Very easy to set up. And my daughter loves it.,5
2211,"Very easy to use from the 1st time. Much better than other pumps I've used. Very Comfortable. Takes the stress out of expressing. Great for use with the storage bottles as can pump, store then feed without faffing around and changing bottles/storage. Would definitely recommend",5
2212,"Very easy to use with multiple mobile (we have 5.5 and 5.2inch mobile) both fit very well in it and are stable through the fixing system.Can be turn to have the mobile in paysage mode.2 size for inserting the holder in the differents vents of the car, however the big one are quite big and can be a nit loose, but the small one fit perfectly.",5
2213,Very easy to use!,5
2214,Very easy to use. The combination of suckers and Velcro male it easy to adjust for a variety of window sizes.Once in place almost all light is blocked out.,5
2215,Very expensive but worth every penny.,4
2216,Very good,5
2217,Very good and delivered within 3 days. Our 2.5 year old loves it.,5
2218,Very good and fast delivery,5
2219,very good and handy,5
2220,Very good at holding my Nexus 6p,5
2221,Very good blind for my little mans room. Keeps it pitch black ;) and also fits my tiny window,5
2222,"Very good breast pump, find electric expressing slower than manual but I get a LOT more milk than when I manual express. Would definitely recommend this pump and this is my favourite make.",5
2223,"very good car mount! The phone doesn't fall from it, which is great and it fits any phones. the only downside is that ours is placed in the aircon area, which has eventually ruined one of the air con adjusters.",5
2224,Very good did what they made for i really happy with it,5
2225,Very good first iPad for little ones.,5
2226,Very good for young kids.,5
2227,Very good indeed.,5
2228,Very good item,5
2229,Very good item kids love it and it well protected,5
2230,"Very good little phone holder. Used it recently for a trip accross europe (no sat nav in my car so use my phone maps) held my phone securely over some of the worst bumps and shaky ferry ramps! I have to have the vernt the right way round (i.e upside down in my car) otherwise the weight of the phone tips the vent down! But thats because the vent isn't designed for it so no fault of this handy holder! Some of the comments about the rubber degrading and metal scatching worried me when purchasing but I have sinve discovered the vents in my car are a standard one that is very cheap to replace if that happens, though I may buy another of these in a year to avoid that still its cheap enough.",5
2231,Very good my husband does night shift and it gets used so he can sleep easier in the bright sunny days.,5
2232,Very good product,5
2233,Very good product !!!,5
2234,Very good product and delivery,5
2235,Very good product at a good price. Does the job well.,5
2236,"Very good product, sturdy and easy use",5
2237,"Very good product. I also have the Belkin holder for my other car which was twice the price of this one, there's really no difference other than the belkin looks a bit nicer. In hindsight I'd have bought two of these. I'm using it with an iPhone 6s and an SE (5 sized), no issues.",5
2238,Very good product. Kids love it.,5
2239,"Very good product. Our child has improved some of his skills like listening, drawing and etc.Update:Still using t a lot and we are even happier :-))",5
2240,very good purchase,5
2241,"very good quality item: it sticks to the window frame ok, it does the job perfectly. it can be adapdet to any window size.",5
2242,Very good quality. Fast delivery. Holds on strong and blocks out sun. Very happy with the purchase.,5

2254,"Very good, simple reliable, works fine, I bought two one for me and partner, no issues.",5
2255,Very good!,5
2256,VERY GOOD! MY KID LOVES IT VERY MUCH!,5
2257,Very good. I can use the Fire even as a mum... ohhh! I like it...,5
2258,very handy and easy holder,5
2259,"Very handy mobile holder. Fits the vertical vents on a Mk2 Ford Kuga, where other options for mobile holders are limited. The holder itself is well made and robust, and fits securely to the vents.",5
2260,Very handy piece of kit that seems to be well constructed. I have tried others with varied success but the Mpow is one of the better ones I have tried.,5
2261,"Very handy, easily portable and will cover most windows. Sucker struggle on wood.",5
2262,Very happy,5
2263,Very happy with it. My 2.5 yr old throws it around and no problems till date . Tough built.,5
2264,Very happy with my item,5
2265,Very happy with the holder,5
2266,Very happy with this purchase.,5
2267,"Very happy with This, really kiddie friendly",5
2268,Very happy with this. Those complaining about the suction cups all you have to do is dampen them very slightly with either water or even saliva and they stick very well onto the window. The velcro is very useful for getting these down to the right size for the windows.,5
2269,Very impressive when you see them on really look the biz,5
2270,Very neat and discreet. Attaches to the vent easily and securely. Much better than the previous vent mounted holder I had and great that it can turn through 180 degrees. Happy with this purchase,5
2271,Very neat.  I have tried various phone holders but don't like ones that fit on the windscreen or dashboard as they either obscure my view or fall off!  This one is unobtrusive and doesn't damage the vent.,5
2272,Very Nice,5
2273,Very nice and very cheap.Worth every penny.Rest assured you wont be disappointed.,5
2274,Very nice earrings the stones really sparkle and they are great quality.  Will be buying some for my self.  Love them.,5
2275,Very Nice Earrings.,5
2276,Very nice earrings. Cheap box though.,4
2277,very nice for xmas,5
2278,"Very nice. Solved my problem, now I won't wake up at 5am. It very stable to stick on the windows, 5 days so far, it hasn't fallen down yet. Would recommend this to the people who sensitive about lighting during the Summer.",5
2279,"Very nice..not so massive, but strong..Hope to last long.Thanks",5
2280,Very nive,5
2281,Very pleased arrived the morning after I ordered very good itemWould recommend this seller.,5
2282,Very pleased very good for price,5
2283,Very pleased with blind. Folds down and into bag very well and can be taken anywhere. It stays stuck to the window and is easily adjusted by sticking the Velcro together to make it fit the window. Makes the nursery completely dark. Was brilliant when we recently stayed in a chalet in Cornwall.,5
2284,very pleased with said item,5
2285,Very pleased with the shaver good battery life and excellent results and fast delivery.,5
2286,Very pleased with these earrings. Arrived next day and they look lovely,5
2287,"Very pleased with this product, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very neatly and nicely.Inside was the mount and the installation instructions were on the back. of the box.It works exactly as I wanted it to, and is surprisingly secure considering how little it is, although it was a little bit difficult to set up - which sounds daft - but is not the products' fault, only mine. This is because I didn't know how hard I had to press to make sure it attached into the vent . Like I said earlier though, once this product is in, it stays in.The ability to rotate my phone in the mount is also very useful, and it's secure so if you decide to rotate your phone to landscape, you don't need to worry about it slipping so that you can't see it properly. It will stay where you want it to.Overall, I am very impressed with this little product, and I am very happy that I own it.",5
2288,Very pleased worth the money,5
2289,"Very portable and easy to put up, take down. Covers large window and blacks out completely, excellent for rented accommodation or if you don't want the hassle of installing a blind",5
2290,very pretty,5
2291,Very pretty and delicate,5
2292,"very pretty and the size I expected, good quality",5

2307,Very secure and seems well made.,5
2308,"Very simple, well made, feels robust, grips the vent well so does the job!",5
2309,Very small! But still pretty.,4
2310,Very smart,5
2311,Very sparkly and comfortable.  I've had many compliments.  Excellent value for money.,5
2312,very sparkly and delicate and very light to wear,5
2313,"very sparkly, pretty earrings. just as expected.",5
2314,"Very sparkly,goes well with any outfit,not too pricey.",5
2315,Very strong magnet that can hold the phone in place even with my F1 style driving over speed bumps! I tried very hard to dislodge the phone to no avail. Nice touch is the extra metal plate you get in the box that can be attached to an existing case or another phone. Perfect!The case itself is very VERY thin. It does the job and doesn't take any aesthetics away from the device. Although wish it was available in more colours. Other than that. Excellent!!,5
2316,Very sturdy and good quality!,5
2317,"Very sturdy and it my car wasn't 20 years old it might fit on the airvents! As it is, it won't. Hopefully it will work in my parents car when I drive it as it is only a 2016 model.",5
2318,"Very use full, and best quality phone holder.",5
2319,Very useful - gives us all a good night's sleep!,5
2320,Very useful excellent choice for travelling with my little ones,5
2321,Very useful for our little one. Easily packs away in its little bag so can be moved around with no problem. Took it on holiday with us (in the U.K.) and our little one slept well with it covering a window with very thin curtains,5
2322,Very useful works well & great for travelling . Sticks well to most windows / glass or tucks over curtain rail .,5
2323,Very versatile. Take and use anywhere. It does what it says it does. Good quality product.,5
2324,"Very well made and holds the phone pretty stable. I had to return it though because it didn't quite fit my car vents.The rubber legs that go into the vents are fine and they have a really good grip, the issue I had is that the hole thing is a bit to thick, so if your car vents are very narrow between one vent and the other, then you'll find it won't fit, or you can make it fit but you will be pushing the vents open if that makes any sense.",5
2325,Waited months for the Kids 8 to be on special offer. Massive improvement over the Kids 7. More memory and bigger screen. Eldest loves it.,5
2326,Was a bit of a pain in the a*#e to put up at first but once is figured it out it was up in no time. Blacks out everything perfectly and has helped the little'un sleep much better. No more sun blaring through his window,5
2327,"Was a little unsure but this works brilliantly for my daughters room especially with the sunlight coming earlier these days and setting later in the night,keeps her bedtime routine going just like in the winter months.",5
2328,Was better than expected. Brought for my 5 year old for her birthday present. Would recommend this over an iPad for younger children. Much safer having so much control over what she is doing on it and time limits.,5
2329,Was exactly as described and does the job well.,5
2330,Was looking for something to hold my phone as I use as a satnav and this is perfect. Holds very steady.,5
2331,"Was purchased  to dim outside light during labour for more chilled , less clinical, environment .Suction was great and did the blackout job very well. Decent purchase which I'll use for years .",5
2332,Was very impressed with this product. Have reccomeded to other.,5
2333,"Was worried when I was reading some reviews for this pump but I needn't have. Great pump, varying pump strength is so handy. Doesnt take long to express a good volume. Long power lead too which is handy if your seat isn't near a socket. Would recommend. The bottles are great too. My daughter likes the chunky teats and haven't had any nipple confusion with them.",5
2334,Wasn’t for me but person seems happy,5
2335,Wasn’t happy with how deliever driver left my parcel but my son loves this easy to use and very kid friendly,5
2336,"We already have one, needed another, great price, great item as this one has the velcro to adjust lenght/ width, recieved quickly",5
2337,We bought this as an xmas gift for our 2yr old son so he can read the books and watch the videos whilst having the added bonus of all the games to play too.I think Mummy and Daddy love it as much as he does :-)I would most definitely recommend this to any parent with small children who get bored easily when shopping and during medium to long travels.The case is a rubbery foam and provides a good amount of protection especially when stubborn children decide to tantrum and either drop or throw it.,5
2338,"We bought this for our camper-van, to save putting up curtains but wanted to lay in later than 5am with the kids!...they slept until 9am, so we are very happy.  The curtain is huge so covers a massive area, the suction cups which hold the product to the windows go all the way round the curtain so you can also stick the sides down, stopping any light gaps, the suction cups are also slightly in from the side of the curtain to stop gaps at the edges which i thought was very good.  The stars pattern on it is nice and it feels great quality....would defo recommend.",5
2339,"We bought this for our grandson's sixth birthday and it's been a huge success. There's no getting away from the fact that this is an expensive tablet with an extra premium for the 'made for kids' label, but I'm glad that we splashed out the extra cash for this. The case is extremely robust; ideal for little hands and there is a sense that, following nuclear wipe-out, the only things left would be cockroaches and these tablets.Set up is very easy and simple and there's enough charge straight from the box is sufficient to allow the child to play with it within just a few minutes.The main thing that makes the extra cost worthwhile is the year's free subscription to all of the Kindle stuff. The sheer volume of apps, cartoons, films, programmes, games and other stuff is staggering. Of course, our grandson made a beeline for the games, with which he's delighted, but there's also lots of sneakily educational stuff there too.The only grumble is that it isn't possible to get full use of this tablet unless it's connected to a wi-fi connection. That's fine most of the time but it means that this tablet can't be used in the car to play videos, for example (unless your car has a mobile internet connection). There is a USB connection so some IT whizz might be able to work out how to use a phone as a 'tether', but that's beyond me.Since he received this tablet, our grandson has hardly put it down and I suspect that that's the best review that I can offer!",5
2340,We bought this for our recent holiday and it was fantastic! It's so effective!,5
2341,"We bought this for our two year old for Christmas. It has an amazing range of different programs that kids can watch, as well as books and games. The childproof rubber case has also been well tested and is holding up so far.",5
2342,"We bought this twice. The first time for the baby's room, which gets a lot of sun light during the summer. Excellent, as it keeps the room pitch dark so she can get good sleep. The second time round we bought one for our room, for the same purpose.",5
2343,"We decided to buy a tablet for our two children to share. The item arrived on time in appropriate packaging and was easily set up.The protective casing has come in handy more times than I can count, and the safety net of the replacement within two years is fantastic piece of mind, as this is an incredibly well used piece of technology in our house.There are more children’s apps than I can list; games, videos and so much more. More than enough to keep children occupied and entertained for as long as you allow them to use it.The fact that the tablet can be used safely for children under one profile, and then I can simply switch to a tablet which does everything I could possibly want it to do is amazing and makes it perfect for the whole family.",5
2344,"We got one after our daughter bought one for our grandsons bedroom.Our intention was to use it for when little Zac stayed with us.It worked so well we now use it in our own bedroon and it really shuts out the early daylight very well.An added bonus it seems to help cut external noise coming in,(We live near an airport),so a definite win win.",5
2345,"We got this blind when our one year old started waking up very early (5 am) with the light mornings, we use it every night. Since we've been using it she reliably sleeps until 7am. We have also taken the blind away on holiday and it did the trick. It's a one size fits all black out blind, so it's not going to be a perfect fit on all windows, but it is adjustable and we haven't had any problems with it so far.",5
2346,"We had tried roller blinds but found the light still kept getting through, but with this the light couldn't get through, it's a brilliant blind for our little boys room especially for day time naps and through the light summer months. Also really good to take when your visiting friends or family. Only one downside is it's a bit of a fiddle if you want to put it up and take it down everyday.",5
2347,We have 2 of these for our 4 and 5 year old grandchildren and they love them. They are easy to use with plenty of content.,5
2348,"We have a three year old son. Like most kids, as soon as the sun is up, he thinks it's time for him to get up.  Naturally, this being a black out blind, it solved that problem. In fact, it does such a good job, we bought one for our room too. The blind is also easy to fit. It comes with suction cups so it can be stuck directly on to the window or, in our case, the window frame. It's also adjustable. It is fitted with velcro strips so it can be made to fit smaller windows if necessary with no overhangs young children might be tempted to play with.And, with young children in mind, it can be removed during the day, so no cords dangling where children can get caught.",5
2349,We have only a blind in our bedroom and I have been waking around 5am every morning since the beginning of summer. But since I have bought this product I haven’t had that problem. I have full night sleep now.It was easy to hang. I think our blind helps it to stay in tact.,5
2350,"We have taken on hols it's great my son usually wakes up at about 6am at home but was 7am today , auctions have fallen off a couple of times but easy to stick back on , love the moon & stars design on it ! Defo must have for summer hols !",5
2351,"We have this on our childs windows because it is tilted, like  \  <--- This. And now that summer is comming we needed to keep out the light. This is easy to setup, and pull down. Just remember to use all the suction cups, so it wont fall down.",5
2352,"We have two of these blinds covering the two windows in my baby's room. They offer total blackout protection from bright sunlight and as an added bonus they seem to help block the heat coming in from the windows, which face south in our house.The suckers are very big and strong and stick either to the glass or to the plastic window frame and don't fall off in the night. My son sleeps very well with these blinds and this morning it was 9am and he was only just starting to wake up, so for that alone I give them 5 stars :)",5
2353,We have used this all summer to add extra coolness and darkness to my LO room. Great to pack and take away on holiday too. Would definitely recommend this product.,5
2354,"We live in a flat in a Victorian building (very large windows) and this works perfectly. Makes the room really dark, perfect for watching movies.Seems really good quality and is easy to fix to the window.",5
2355,We love it 😀,5
2356,We love this as our little one sleeps longer when we use it. X,5
2357,"We needed something quickly, and getting a permanent blind in would take too long.  I had totally forgotten about these until a neighbour mentioned them, so we got them in time to trial them for a week of holiday, and probably couldn't have survived without them.  They are absolutely brilliant and finally give our son a properly dark room.  They are now a permanent fixture in his room and only take a minute at the start and end of the day to open up and re-close.The only thing to watch is that they create a tight seal over the windows, so in extreme heat make sure you leave a side open for airflow.",5
2358,We never go anywhere without it!,5
2359,We took this to France last summer and although we only needed it two nights it was worth it. Easy to put up and kept the room nice and dark do baby slept a little longer,5
2360,We use it to cover a curtainless window in our living room. That window fills with light from 6pm onwards unless the blind's up. Our baby son finds it impossible to fall asleep unless it's cool and dark in the room so this blind has been a godsend.,5
2361,We use them every day.. they really work properly!,5
2362,"we use this in our hall window as the early morning sunlight was waking our son very early, this has been an ideal solution & even fits out unusual shaped window (it' half the width of the rest of the windows but still 160cm drop. stays up really well & blocks the light great",5
2363,"We used this on holiday as his room at home is very dark, and this worked perfectly. It was a large very bright window and the blind made is darker than his room at home! Perfect!",5
2364,We used this on our long haul red eye plane and worked a charm. Baby girl (16months old) slept the entire flight (10H). It makes a huge difference than not having anything and attaches easily around the plane seats. Highly recommend,5
2365,"We used this when we moved into our flat before we had curtains sorted, worked really well! Recommended by our friends with a baby who use it during the day for nap times",5
2366,"We were struggling in the summer months with our daughter waking up around 5am. Since we put this on her bedroom window, she wakes up closer to 7. Whether it is the darker room or just the passing of time I don't know but we are definitely happier parents. The blinds are very easy to stick to any window and can easily be adapted to the width and length thanks to the useful velcro. It is a bit of a hassle to have to unstick them to be able to open the windows but it hasn't been an issue in terms of adherence, the blind stays in place when we put it back up. Great choice of blackout blind.",5
2367,Well happy with my Item thanks again.,5
2368,Well made and does what it says. I can now sleep in past 6:30am without the early morning wake up call from our 5yr old! He no longer wakes up as soon as it gets light as it's still dark in his room. Result..... :D,5
2369,Well made and very stable but you have to remember you loose the use of an air vent.,5
2370,"Well packaged. Easy purchasing. Really good, room very dark. Baby sleeps in 😀",5
2371,Well worth the money.We have taken this on holiday with us so many times and it’s brilliant.,5
2372,"Well, i work nightshift. And this is a godsend. Having issues with dozing off due to that bright summer shine at 9am, i was recommended a ""baby black out blind with stars on it"" by a workmate. I was sceptical, but i can say.. it's perfect, and genuinely blacks out the room. It has an adorable stars pattern which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, despite my topsy turvy body clock.The blind has a great velcro/fastening feature which allows you to slightly extend or decrease the width of the blind vertically. I highly recommend it!",5
2373,"what a bargain and will be a super gift, kept them handy",5
2374,What a fantastic idea! Unless you never take your child away from home you simply have to have this blind. Blackout effect is great and clever velcro tabs allows it to adjust & fit most average size windows.,5
2375,"What a great idea!!  Completely blocks out light, if only it could block out sound too! I was a bit dubious about the suckers, but they seem to work well. Velcro allows the size to be adjusted to the window.",5
2376,"What a great idea. I really struggle to sleep when there's too much light. I rent rooms in London and often the solution is expensive but now I have found this, I don't need to worry about finding a dark room to rent.",5
2377,What a great product at that price - bargain!,5
2378,What a lifesaver this has been! Don't know how I ever lived without it!,5
2379,What a super great and easy purchase. Arrived in perfect condition and my experience was brilliant. Highly recommended:),5
2380,"What an amazing invention! Bought to ensure blacked out rooms for my baby when staying anywhere - I now use it at home as its so bright at this time of year in mornings/evenings. Easy to use anywhere, covers a large window space so would be suitable for most windows (not long enough to cover patio door though for example). Easy to adjust, folds neatly and very light, and most importantly, creates a very dark room! Considering buying another for my own room! Excellent product. Would highly recommend.",5
2381,"What can I say granddaughter loves it,good job it's got that rubber case around it been dropped a few times",5
2382,"What every parent needs - no worries about breakage, no accidental purchases by little ones, excellent content, downloadable for long journeys, little hands can hold it, just cannot fault.",5
2383,"When I bought my Series 7 I was stunned at how much better it was than my previous Philips. But when I got the 9, mainly because it was on offer and gave the opportunity to gift my 7 to my son, I wasnt expecting much of an improvement.I was wrong.It shaves faster and gets more awkward hairs first time. The trimmer is better. It rinses under a tap better as the head is more open, and finally the cleaning station has a little fan that dries it after cleaning nice and quickly.Simply excellent",5
2384,"When I came across this product, I could not wait to try it. It darkens the room perfectly and the quality of the sleep has improved a lot. This is not only for a baby but for anyone who wants a quick and easy solution for your sleeping problems!If you clean the window prior to attaching the curtain, it would not come off!Have used it for a few months and no issues at all!",5
2385,When I re-attached the curtain on the window properly it holds up fine. Great product,5
2386,"When I was offered the opportunity to test the Braun Series 7, I was unsure. I usually use a wet razor and on the handful of occasions I have used a dry shaver I have been unimpressed by the poor shave quality and skin irritation. After reading about Braun's Sonic Technology, which reads and adapts to your beard, along with the adjustable shaving modes, I decided to give it a go.The Braun Series 7 arrived in impressive packaging, which contained a clean & charge station, cable, cleaning solution and the shaver, complete with its own case and cleaning brush. A quick thumb through the user manual was all I needed to be confident with the product, which looks great, and feels great quality. I used the clean & charge station to charge the shaver, which can also be charged directly from the cable, ideal for travelling.The first time I used the shaver was for a dry shave and I was impressed. A good close shave and no skin irritation, which took no time at all. The head moves freely in order to shave those harder to reach places, and the pop up trimmer on the back works well for sideburns etc. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft my skin felt after using the Braun Series 7, despite the fact that I hadn’t used my usual cream.I decided I would use the Braun Series 7 in the shower for my next shave, as I would if I was using my usual razor. Again, I was  really impressed with the way it performed, and how good my skin felt. After use, I just placed the shaver back into the clean & charge station, which left it clean, fresh and smelling great.If I had to pick a negative, I would have liked the plug to have a three pin adaptor. Not everyone has a shaver plug in their bathroom and I had to buy an adaptor. Overall, I was really impressed with the Braun Series 7. My skin is quite sensitive, and would expect a new shaver to leave me feeling dry and sore, however after using the Braun Series 7 my face felt great, and the shave was much quicker than I expected. It looks stylish, feels great quality and the charge & clean station leaves the shaver like new after each use. I would thoroughly recommend it.",5
2387,"When the clocks changed it wasn't an issue with my 8 month old at first, but as the nights got lighter it got harder to put her to bed.....backed down and got this.....best thing ever!!!!!! We are going away in June and will be taking it with us as its so easy to put up and take down!",5
2388,"When the last set of Braun shavers was released I was impressed by their whole offering to a seriously high degree.The fact of the matter is that Braun have continually improved their electric shavers to the point that they are probably the best availble on the market - though with the one caveat that they aren't cheap.The latest Braun Series 9 9095CC is the pinnacle of their offering.It comes with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a top end electric shaver including a charging and cleaning dock which can clean and charge your shaver when required.The thing I find most impressive about this shaver is how close the shave is, it's definitely the closest I've got to using a traditional shaver (this was previously held by the top end Panasonic electric shaver which I've also reviewed). Don't get me wrong, this isn't as close as a traditional razor but it is very good. I also found that this shaver was much improved when it came to picking up the thinner hairs lower down on the neck which can be missed by many shavers. It can also be used in the shower if you wish to enjoy a wet shave - personally not something I like but the option is there if you wish to use it.So suffice to say that the actual shaving element is very very good - I'd happily say best in class.The actual operation of the device is equally good, it's ergonomic and lasts for 1.5 - 2 weeks on a single shave (which is fantastic and means I don't constantly need to bring a charger when travelling). Of course the shaver will ask to be cleaned during that 2 week period but I don't think the odd one off 2 week stint is too much of an issue.The shaver also features a useful battery indicator which gives a good idea of how long you've got left. The beard trimmer on the back is the same as every other Braun shaver - I don't feel like it's being changed much. The head does swivel more than previous iterations of Braun shavers which probably accounts for the closer shave - though it doesn't affect the operation.The clean and charge station is also improved as it now features a fan to dry it after it has been cleaned. You get 1 cartridge of the cleaning fluid included and then have to buy replacements as and when necessary. I use the device every day and in the past wouldn't change it more than every 3 months or so. They are available in multipacks but they aren't too expensive. The shaver head is said to last around 18 months after which you'll need to buy a replacement which will probably cost around £50 which is quite dear but it's a necessary evil.All in all I'm very impressed by Braun's latest shaver, yes it is not cheap, but you're paying for quality and a shaver which should last a very long time.",5
2389,"Why did I not get this sooner!I live in Scotland and in summer it gets light very early in the morning and you would think that everybody would be investing in dark blinds. Not my landlady, she's got white transparent blinds...Anyway, I went through several trials and this is the most awesome dark blinds ever. The suction cups are strong enough to hold the blinds in place, I also use velcro to make sure. If you're hesitating, stop! And order them.",5
2390,Wife loves them..great service..thanks,5
2391,Wife used this and said it was first class.,5
2392,Will be a present - I needed the backs to be the the crook type which are perfect for a person with arthritis in their hands but I was a tad disappointed in the size of the stone but they are very pretty and for what they cost can't complain.,5
2393,Will make a lovely Christmas present.,5
2394,Will stick to any glass. Gives back out.,5
2395,Wish I had bought this before,5
2396,wish I'd bought this ages ago as have been waking up too early (an hour before alarm usually) and had enough!the delivery was prompt and item packaged really well.did wonder if it would be big enough to fit the door in my room leading to the balcony but needn't have as it fits from top to bottom with a couple of inches to spare in length and width would easily do half of the door again! no curtain poles or wires just easy to use suckers which stock well on the galss and pvc frame so no need to bother the other half with laborious DIY so a must have!! if it ever needs replacing I won't hesitate to get another! :),5
2397,Wish I'd bought this sooner. My east facing conservatory becomes almost unusable when morning sun makes it impossible to read screens etc This blind with its sucker attachments easily and quickly attaches to my window and provides enough shade to make the room a pleasure again. Love the design of moon and stars.,5
2398,"Wish I'd discovered this earlier ! Although we have a black out blind and curtains in our daughters bedroom it still let light in and she was waking earlier and earlier ! This has solved his problems, not a shred of light gets in, so easy to put up and take down . It comes everywhere with us now , Thanks!",5
2399,"With a light-sleeping daughter and a bedroom which faces sunset, this has proved an invaluable purchase as she has historically had problems going to sleep during the summer. Very easy to fit with sucker pads that stay up and velcro patches to 'adjust' the size as needed. Highly recommended.",5
2400,"With Braum being the lead the manufacturer, thus us by far the best horse in the staple, well worth its price when considering its outstanding characteristics.",5
2401,"With RRP of £330, this is a costly shaver but it is without a doubt the best I have ever used. Bear in mind that you are not getting just the shaver itself, you are getting the clean and charge station which, as its name suggests, cleans, lubricates and charges the shaver in a convenient way. Braun claims that using the station is 10 times more hygienic than simply rinsing the shaver under tape water and produces a closer shave and better skin comfort.So far, I have no reasons not to believe the marketing blurb. Ease of use and comfort are the two features that make this shaver so highly recommended. The shaver is big (compared to my previous shavers anyway) but very gentle: it adapts to the contour of my face, making shaving a more pleasant experience. I particularly like the pop-up long hair trimmer that deals with my sideburns so effectively. I can even shave during a shower, with or without gel.The downside is that this system requires some maintenance. The cutting system cassette requires changing every 18 months and occasional oiling, while the cleaning centre refill needs attention about once a month. A minor irritation is that the station is on the big side and noisy when operated.This is one occasion when you definitely get the quality you pay for. If you're considering a high-end shaver, this is the one to go for.",5
2402,"Without a doubt the best Xmas present this year bought for my 2 year old (turning 3 very soon) it is brilliant and great to control use, not to mention the amount of things available for her to use on it from video to apps and best of all books! Bought during the Black Friday period so was definitely worth the money although having it now I would have no issue paying full price.",5
2403,Wonderful item for youngsters.  Robust and easy to use.,5
2404,"Wonderful, perfect buy",5
2405,"Wonderful, so pleased. Great speed of service, nicely packaged, very professional. Thank you so much",5
2406,Worked a treat when on holiday in the summer. I just breathed onto the suction cups to dampen them slightly and they stayed on the glass fine.  There were plenty of suction cups so if one failed the blind stayed up. Child stayed asleep! It is a bit time consuming if you choose to take it down everyday but worth it.,5
2407,Worked great on our trip! Nice ability to adjust the size.  Extended well to cover the edges of windows.,5
2408,Working well. Good machine,5
2409,Works  well and stops light coming in,5
2410,works a treat,5
2411,"Works a treat. I did wonder if it was going to be any use, but slots into the air vent perfectly, and holds really great as proven by my heavy phone, only thing is since I have a silicone cover on my phone, sometimes when I detach my phone, it knocks off one of the plastic covers from the side of the clip, which is easily attached again, but it's a shame. Delivered promptly and no fuss. Highly recommended!!",5
2412,"Works amazingly well, but sadly my baby still likes to get up at 5am grrr!!Recommended for shift workers too!",5
2413,Works as as described and attaches firmly to the Air vent in both our cars. Ad we use multiple phones in it.,5
2414,"Works as expected, its a blackout blind with suction cups, not much more to say really!Blocks light well and certainly small enough to take away with you.",5
2415,Works as intended. I use a galaxy note 4 in a bulky case and it fits perfect.,5
2416,Works as it should do,5
2417,"works better than expected absolutely solid.doesnt fall off on rough surfaces,holds the phone very very well..impressed,,excellent product...",5
2418,"Works brilliantly, it was for my 4 year olds room to stop the sun beaming in while she was trying to sleep.Helps a lot in the mornings as well, she was getting up at half six now isn't waking till at least 8 (Hello more sleep).The only issue I had was the suction cups didn't seem to hold it up very well but got around this easily by getting some Velcro strips and attaching the blind to that now it doesn't move : )",5
2419,Works exactly as described. Good product. Recommend,5
2420,"Works great, can fit any size window due to the suction pads.",5
2421,"works great, many thanks!",5
2422,Works great. Fast shipping.,5
2423,Works just as I thought. Has been an amazing help to get my daughter to sleep for her naps in the days,5
2424,works like a charm,5
2425,works on any window,5
2426,Works perfect for every window. We took it with us on vacation and loved it!,5
2427,Works perfect! Zero movement from phone when driving!,5
2428,works perfectly,5
2429,"Works perfectly for my MkIII Skoda Octavia and iPhone 6S - holds the phone firmly, but also easy to remove and the position of the phone is ideal for navigation apps.",5
2430,Works perfectly for my Peugeot 207 and google pixel xl phone.,5
2431,"Works perfectly with my window, makes the room very dark.",5
2432,Works perfectly. Easy to insert onto vent and doesn't move when driving. Fits my LG G6 just fine and could actually work for phones even bigger.,5
2433,Works perfectly. Exactly as described. Not had one issue with my S7.,5
2434,Works perfectly. It fits snugly in the vent of my Lexus IS 220D. I was worried that it might be a cheap wobbly bit of plastic but it is actually well built and I feel like it holds my iPhone safely due to the soft rubberised grip on the inside of the claws.I'd highly recommend this if you're in the market for a phone holder for your car. And it's a good price too. I'm dead happy with it :-),5
2435,Works quite well - bit bulkier & heavier than I expected but good quality material.,5
2436,Works really well with my Note 7.,5
2437,"Works really well, as long as suction cups are moist it doesn't loose suction. The only downside is I had to buy it through Amazon, whom quite frankly I detest with every fibre of my being!",4
2438,"Works really well, blocks out all light, even the shards of light that do get through with the early morning sun are directed against the wall rather than out into the room. The attachments work well against the window surface even though I got the bigger size and we had to fold it on itself in some parts as per the instructions.",5
2439,"Works really well, very happy with the product, holds the iPhone 7 solidly and I'm happy I don't need to stick anything to the windscreen.",5
2440,Works really well.,5

2446,Works well and would buy again,5

2448,Works well for our children,5
2449,works well great invention holds iphone very well,5
2450,Works well with Samsung S8 or Renault Zoe.,5
2451,"Works well, fairly good grip on the airvents.",5

2453,Works wonders in summer,5
2454,"Worth every penny, no more razor burn, I can shave twice a day with no skin irritation what so ever. I only wish I had purchased it years ago.",5
2455,Would definitely recommend for babies room.,5
2456,would highly recommend these to parents who are going on holiday and still want there kids to sleep well. an absolute must buy!,5
2457,"Wow, what can i say, I'm floored by this product. I have dark thick facial hair and have tried electric razors in the past but gave up as none of them could match a wet shave with a razor. I was waiting for the technology to improve the product and now its arrived in the shape of the Braun 9095cc. I deliberately didnt shave for two days awaiting this razor and have just had a shave and my face is now baby soft and my skin is not sore. It also cleans itself too :0",5
2458,"WOW! bought as an xmas present for a 4 year old boy and he loves it, he's got Blippi wherever he goes now",5
2459,"Wow! I LOVE this product! Firstly the delivery was super quick, it arrived 2 days after placing my order which is always a bonus because no one likes waiting around for a delivery. Secondly, it transforms a room from day to night in only a few minutes which is perfect for when it's nap time for children (or even adults) I  would highly recommend this product and will deffinatly buy more in the future if needed!",5
2460,"Wow! I’m so pleased I ordered this. It’s for my little boy for Christmas he’s 4 and I’ve been unsure if it would be a good idea for him to have his own tablet.. but I have no worries with this. It’s all set up with his profile, age appropriate apps, videos and books. I can’t recommend this enough. It’s a great size, case is lovely and fanatic quality, easy to use, so fast and perfect for what I want it for. I know he’ll love having the independence but I can relax knowing there’s nothing that shouldn’t be there. So much better than I thought it was going to be. Don’t hesitate Buy it!!! You won’t be disappointed",5
2461,Wow!I have always used Rotary shavers in the past along with a traditional single blade every now and then for closeness. - no need anymore!Having previously worked for another Shaver company (Rem) I had always used one of their shavers and was happy with the result but my old one had started to pack up and the long hair trimer a few weeks ago flew off when opened as the 2 knobs holding it in place snapped off....time to look for another.I travel a lot for my work so wanted one that was going to last and be easy to use and give me a decent shave that I demand...Having read the reviews I convinced myself that the Braun 9095CC was the one for me but could I justify the £165 (down from £325 odd full RRP) but as my last shaver had lasted a good 8 years plus I thought the cost spread over this same time period is not a lot invested each year so I went for it...Ordered on Amazon Prime 8pm Sunday evening and it was delivered Bank Holiday Monday at 9am! now that is service - thank you Amazon.Unpacked the shaver and charged it up as required for 1 hour.I hadn't shaved for 3 days so had a decent amount growth so was interested to see how this would perform as the blurb advised 3 days of growth was no issue..... they were rightmy Wife could not believe how smooth the shave was even around the chin area that had always in the past been 'prickly'.This Braun is simply THE BEST Shaver I have ever owned - German Technology and Engineering at its best.The Cleaner is great as well as it got rid of all the shavings and left the shaver as new.If you are looking for a decent shaver - look no furtherInvest a bit of money and reap the rewards...!Likes = so far everythingDislikes = so far nothing,5
2462,Xmas gift looks great,5
2463,XMAS PRESSIE CAME REALLY QUICK,5
2464,Yes I would recomend realy nice  ,5
2465,Yes very pleased,5
2466,Yes wery apy,5
2467,"Yes, I actually bought two; my son-in-law asked for the first one to be sure he liked it and as he did, he then asked for the second one.  He's well-satisfied and therefore, so am I.",5
2468,"Yesterday I cut (excuse the pun) my loses and just ordered the best electric shaver on the market due to the fact that it is something that I will be using on a regular basis.Wow! I'm a total convert to the world of electric shavers. I'm a Black guy and have sensitive skin and was very reluctant to buy a shaver. I think it was when I had started shaving as a teenager I nicked my dad's Braun (as you do) and used it and it was very irritable bad experience and decided at the time that wet shaving was the best option until today!Again wow! I set everything up and put the solution in the charging station and allowed it to go through the cycle of cleaning, lubricating and drying this amazing piece of kit. After a good hour I had 5 days growth of hair and used the Braun 9 series for the first time ever!!!!! Amazing! Absolutely amazing!!! I must have used this man gadget for about 15 mins . I am clean shaven and cannot believe how smooth my skin is with no skin burn. I am totally blown away by it and would recommend anyone to convert, save up and purchase this amazing device. So there we go! I have thrown all my Wilkinson wet shaves straight in the bin and salute the world of electric man shavers!Seriously anyone reading this take my word for it - it's quality, its awesome, it's Braun, enough said!",5
2469,Yet again Braun have done it. Excellent all-round performer.,5
2470,You can easily stick on the windows and shading effect is also good. I have been using it in my son bedroom and for nothing complaint.,5
2471,"You might be wondering whether the extra price of the All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is worth it.  After all, it seems to be £50 more expensive than the plain All-New Fire HD 8 (£129.99 versus £79.99).Well, I've done the sums, and it is a good deal...With the Kids edition, you get the All-New Fire HD 8 with 32 GB RAM and with no ""special offers"" (adverts).  This is actually worth £109.99.  The £79.99 All-New Fire HD 8 has 16 GB RAM and comes with ""special offers"" (adverts).Additionally, with the Kids edition you get the Amazon Bumper Case (£22.49), 2 years Breakdown and Accidental Damage insurance (£22.50) and 1 years subscription to Amazon Fire For Kids Unlimited (£23.88).  So if this was all bought separately, that would cost £178.87, i.e. you save £48.87.  Note that after 1 year you need to pay £1.99/month for the Fire For Kids content.So, in my opinion, it is worth paying the extra for the Kids Edition.I bought this as we are going on holiday with our toddler soon, and wanted something to entertain him during the flight.We already have an iPad, but thought it would be better to get this Fire Kids tablet as it comes with kid-friendly features and content, the bumper case, and also importantly the 2 years ""no-quibble"" insurance.  This way, we don't have to worry when he's using the tablet, that he'll damage it or break it.I've been playing with it for a couple of days now and initially I wasn't too impressed, as I was comparing it to the iPad.  The processor is noticeably slower and also the screen is a lot less sharp in comparison.  But to be honest, there is a huge price difference between the iPad and the Fire HD, and for taking into account the price, then the performance and screen are very good.The content you get with the Fire For Kids looks good. There are books, apps and videos available.  Books and apps can be downloaded in advance and played offline, but videos are streamed, which means you need an internet connection to watch them.  However you can use other apps to download videos and watch offline (i.e. BBC iPlayer Kids or the Amazon Prime Video app which has a kids section).When the tablet arrives, it will already have an adult profile setup for you, and you can enter the information to create a kids profile.  The kid's profile allows you to restrict how long they use the tablet and also has a simplified view where you can only access the content from Fire For Kids.You can use the tablet in adult mode (which is pin code protected) and then you can use an Internet browser, and also it has apps for shopping on Amazon, accessing Amazon video/music and the Amazon app store.  Note that normally Amazon tablets are restricted and only allow you to donwload apps from the Amazon app store, which has a lot less apps than are available on the Google app store.  However, if you are comfortable with some ""fiddling"", it is possible to install the Google app store on the Fire tablet.  I tried it myself and it worked well.Overall, I would give it 4.5 stars.  I took off 0.5 star because although I doubt my toddler would notice or care, I would like the screen to be a bit sharper and brighter.  Admittedly, you can't really expect that at this price point.  Otherwise, it's a very good tablet and the content provided is very good too.",5
2472,You might need to rotate the back piece to get it to fit but once it's fixed it's very secure. Great little device!,5
2473,"You will not get a better shave than this, it's a s close as a wet shave, excellent quality and quick charging.",5
2474,Yup,5

2482," Mixed feelings here. As an electric toothbrush, it's excellent. At last, it uses a lithium-ion battery, which should last longer between charges (two weeks claimed) and keep going for more recharging cycles (previously I found they wore out after about two years, using the older generation of NiMH batteries). I've been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for over ten years.However, paying extra for Bluetooth connectivity to an app is not worth the premium, unless you like the absurd level of hand-holding involved. I installed the app (Android) and noted it wanted access to my contact list. As I was not willing to allow Procter and Gamble access to my personal contact list, it was programmed not to allow me access to the toothbrush. Bad decision - if I don't allow an (unnecessary) option, it should still have continued. It also requested access to my location, which I also denied. It then asked me to enable it to show weather reports. Maddening - such nonsense for a toothbrush! I have perfectly good weather reporting on the phone, no need for it bundled inside a toothbrush app. So I uninstalled the app, not impressed one iota.But is the toothbrush any good? Yes, it's brilliant.It came with three different heads, but the explanation of the difference between them was buried in the manual, no name on the brush packaging. I went for my usual (the best for those without sensitive gums) - cross-action.So far, there's no version without the app that has a Li-ion battery. That would probably be a better option when it becomes available.",4
2483," Powerful, perhaps too powerful.  I can't say it's a comfortable user experience having this thing vibrating away numbing your hand and face.  Maybe I'll get used to it.  I'll report back in a few months if I do.Curiously they give you a travel pouch to keep it in, but not a stand which is more traditional.  It's a tiny bit more effort unzipping it from the case than it is to lift a razor out of a cradle.I don't personally think any electric razor is worth RRP £270, but if you're looking at this item then you probably do and so have no interest in my opinion on that matter.It's obviously well built and it gives a slightly better/closer shave than my other razors.  Not £270 worth better, but again no one cares what I have to say about that.Ignoring the price, would I recommend it?  Yes, I guess.  Not with any enthusiasm, but it does do the job well without blowing me away with a super close shave (I only shave dry so that might make a difference to how good a job it does).",4
2484," The Braun Oral-B Pro 6000 Electric Toothbrush is a top-of-the range electric toothbrush that's designed to ensure that the user gets the full performance out of the device whilst providing a powerful brushing action to ensure that the user's teeth are cleaned to a very high standard.To achieve this Oral-B have firstly designed an electric toothbrush that really works overtime to get the bristles cleaning off as much plaque and 'lodged-on' food as possible. The 4x TriZone toothbrush heads that are included provide a range of different brushing actions - sensitive clean, floss action, 3D white (i.e. whitening) and crossaction.To help ensure that the user gets the full use out of the toothbrush, a separate wireless monitor is included that times the use of the brush, separating the mouth into quarters with a recommended 30 seconds spent on each quarter. The monitor can be set for a Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, Gum Care or Tongue Cleaning. All these modes seem to do their respective jobs accordingly - with the Whitening and Gum Care options producing a sort of 'revving action' (see video).The brush and monitor also inform the user when too much pressure is applied to the teeth, with a glowing red light illuminating the reverse side of the brush and an unhappy face simultaneously appearing on the monitor screen. Personally I find this particular function on these electric toothbrushes incredibly handy, as prior to using them, it turns out I used to apply a tad too much pressure when brushing my teeth.The toothbrush also has a Bluetooth function to it which connects to your Smart Phone or Tablet using an Oral-B app that you can download. Set up, the app will chart your brushing progress and gives you added programming and personalising of your toothbrushes functionality.  I have to admit that this all seems a bit over-the-top to me and really reminds me of that classic Rhod Gilbert sketch about such overly-engineered electric toothbrushes with `onboard computers'.The rechargeable battery life seems to be quite reasonable. The manual states that you can use the toothbrush for around ten days (brushing twice a day for 2 mins each time) without recharging. However, it should be noted that the toothbrush is designed so it will never over-charge, meaning you can keep it constantly charging if you want - and it won't do it any real harm.As far as the product's actual performance goes, for the month or so that I've been using it, I have to say that I've found the toothbrush to achieve excellent results; really getting into those awkward nooks and crannies - between the teeth and around the gum line.The various gadgetry and illuminating displays are all pretty swish (if you ask me) with the battery power indicator showing the user exactly how much juice is left in the toothbrush at any one given time.The electric toothbrush set also includes a handy stand with a brush-head storage section, as well as a wall mount for the wireless SmartGuide monitor (it has a circular sticky pad which you use to stick the monitor's shell to a flat surface with).All in all it's a pretty impressive electric toothbrush with plenty of nifty gadgetry going on to ensure a darn good clean and absolute ease-of-use. It's unmistakably top-of-the-range and has a price tag to show it.",4
2485,".The Braun Series 9 9040s has a sleek looking in black with blue trim. It is a well-designed unit and handles hairs in such problematic parts as the upper lip, chin and neck easily. The 9040s fits securely in the hands and is not as heavy.Charging does not last long and the charge will hold for longer than three sequential shaves. Except for the shaving head, the shaver consists entirely of plastic. Nevertheless, the shaver is very good in the hand and gives a quality shaving finish. Although it is not equipped with a charging station, it still has the proper charging contacts on the outer side. Apart from the actual electric shaver, there is a just a travel case, power cord and the standard small cleaning brush that comes as standard.Since the Braun 9040s is waterproof, cleaning it under a tap or shower is possible. The battery level is displayed on a LED display – it does not have the one-minute display that is standard in the higher brands. Just like other units in its range the 9040s, shaving head moves in five directions. It allows the setting of a fixed angle, which makes shaving of difficult areas such as the neck much easier. The spring-loaded cutting head glides smoothly over the skin and adapts perfectly to the contours of the face. On average, the shaving is done after about 5-10 minutes without any strain to the skin. If one uses the shaver as a wet razor with foam or cleansing cream, the results are clean and notable. The long hair trimmer is narrow and works well with sideburns. For larger areas, however, it has limited use. As mentioned previously the travel case is well made and protects the Braun Series 9 9040s shaver especially when the unit travels around with its user. A slight negative is that the shaver head does not come with a plastic cap, which might be a problem during travels. Another possible negative of the 9040s is that it cannot be operated with an AC power adapter/cord connected. With the onset of an empty battery, you must wait for at least 5 minutes for the quick charge to take effect before you can continue shaving.When it comes to shaving beard growth that is longer than four days, this shaver will easily tackle it with no effort at all. In fact, on the first pass, you will already start seeing remarkable results that from a distance seem to be satisfactory. To achieve a truly good shave, you will need to go over the skin a few more times. Cleaning is by simply rinsing under running water, brushing regularly and applying a drop of oil occasionally.While it is still highly priced compared to other similar shavers, its performance by far justifies its cost. This shaver is a worthy investment that is guaranteed to serve you for years to come..",4
2486,"‘He Said/She Said’ by Erin Kelly is a crime novel with a difference. Instead of having a murder victim in the first chapter followed by mechanical plot devices of detection and revelation, this story is firmly embedded in the characters of Kit and Laura, young lovers who don’t stumble across the crime - the rape of a young eclipse watcher called Beth – until chapter 9.  By this time, the reader is thoroughly gripped by their story, which is told from their alternating points of view and from different points in time:  2015 (the fictional present), 1999 (the year of the rape) and 2000 (the trial and aftermath).Weaving together these complex strands, but never losing the reader along the way, the story is gradually built up like collage, then spectacularly deconstructed when the reader discovers nothing has been quite what it seems. The twists are unexpected and shocking.The depiction of violence against women is handled sensitively and is never gratuitous. The use of the solar eclipse as a metaphor for gradual darkening and bringing out into the light is a clever and interesting device.  Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommended.I was fortunate enough to hear the author speak about her writing, and to buy a signed copy of this book at a writing conference.",4
2487,"""Oh! What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive"" (W. Scott)And oh what a tangled thread of misconceptions, lies and deceit this proved to be.  Because 3 stars is a 'negative' review on Amazon, I have put 4 but would put this somewhere around 'OK' or 3.5 stars.  Thrillers are not my 'natural' genre, although I recently read Wasp by Fiona Quinn and that held me enthralled.  As I received an arc through Netgalley I felt obliged to finish this book, and only did so after reading reviews that said the book picked up pace and interest in the second half (which it did).I'm sorry but there was just way to much waffle and unnecessary scene setting.  This book could have a good 1/3 cut out from it without affecting the story.  And this extra third made it a very, very long book.  However when you get to the faster paced chapters where you can feel the action starting to happen, the book is good, not amazing, but good.  There were some amazing twists and turns in the book, and when I got to the end of the book scenes much earlier in the book (thinking upper deck scene here) had new meaning.  Whilst I can accept some type of prosecution on the second case (towards the end of the book) I found the actual charge very unlikely - real life has shown a lesser charge or very often no charge in these situations.  However this links to the last line of the book, so perhaps the author did this to have a greater impact.And I HATED that last sentence, I had been a little ambivalent towards the character, whose 'line' it was, for a chunk of the book but that compounded the dislike that had been building for several chapters.  I could not understand their reaction to one lie when they too had been feeling guilty about lying for so long.  This wasn't a book where I particularly warmed to ANY of the characters (at one point Mac seemed to be the most likeable of the lot!).  The last 8 - 10 chapters drastically changed my view of MOST of the main characters and by the end the only character I had any time for was the only genuine victim in the whole book.If your a fan of the author, or psychological thrillers, you may enjoy this.  The writing style is good, easy to read and flows naturally, as does the dialogue.  It was just the slow pace and not terribly likeable characters that made this an 'ok' read for me.",4
2488,"♦ Brief ♦Braun's Oral-B PRO 6000 is a premium rechargeable electric toothbrush which is one step down from the flag-ship model of the SmartSeries; the top model is currently the 'Black Oral-B PRO 6500'.The main features of this particular model are as follows:- Bluetooth technology & performance app.- Six high performance cleaning modes.- Wireless SmartGuide.- Brushing timer.- Brushing sensor technology.- Rechargeable battery that's ""impossible"" to overcharge.♦ Box Contents & Extras ♦- Box Contents: Brush Heads (CrossAction, FlossAction, 3D White & Sensitive)* | Toothbrush Handle | Charging Unit | Brush Head Compartment (Stores up to four) | SmartGuide | SmartGuide Holder | Wall Mount | Adhesive Ring | Travel Case.If you're planning on getting this for use with your whole family, you'll have to purchase extra brush heads.- Replacement heads: Oral-B Braun CrossAction Replacement Rechargeable Toothbrush Heads.- Adaptor: Shaver Adaptor (For those who don't have a shaver port in their bathroom).♦ Set-Up & Use ♦- Charging:Before the first use, it's best to place your main unit on for a long charge.Apparently a full charge can take up to 24-hours which will grant 40 minutes of use... Hmm doesn't sound like much does it?  However if you break it down it works out as 10 days worth of brushing based on two 2-minute sessions per day.- Pairing toothbrush with SmartGuide:1) Hold the ""h/min"" button for 3 seconds until you see an ""L"".2) Turn on the toothbruth, it should now say ""L-1"".3) Press the ""h/min"" button again to go back to the main screen.Yep, it's that quick.  Now every time you turn on your toothbrush, it will automatically connect to the SmartGuide where it will start the 2 minute countdown, awesome stuff eh?- Choosing a mode:You have to turn the toothbrush on first, which is a bit annoying as it starts to vibrate, you then have to wait for the timer to start counting down before pressing the mode button.I'd prefer if you could select the mode before activating the brush head.Also it's important to note that the toothbrush wont remember which mode you had on last.- SmartGuide Device:I really like this device, I didn't realise until using this product that I brushed nowhere near as long as I should have.Every 30 seconds the SmartGuide lets you know when you should switch to another area of your teeth, I personally found this to be really handy.Another good feature is that the SmartGuide will show a unhappy face when you place too much pressure on your teeth.  A red light flashes on the toothbrush also.- Oral-B App:This allows you to connect a device such as a smartphone that supports Bluetooth 4.0 with this toothbrush.  The app can track the progress of your teeth cleaning.  If this sort of thing your floats your boat then it's available for free on the app store, but it's not for me.♦ Results ♦I'm very impressed with this toothbrush, my teeth felt so much cleaner after using this compared to my old standard toothbrush.  It's a toothbrush that does its intended job extremely well, what more can I say?♦ Final Opinion ♦I had never been interested in getting an electric toothbrush before, however after using Oral-B Pro 6000, I will certainly be saving that extra money to get replacement heads over a normal toothbrush.As for the product as a whole, for my uses it has too many features. I don't need 6 different clean modes, nor do I need to use the Bluetooth function with my smartphone to track my teeth cleaning.What I do like is that it does clean well and the SmartGuide is a much loved extra that comes in the package; it's nice to have something that guides me to cleaning my teeth for the recommended time & it has replaced my bathroom clock too.Whilst I really like this toothbrush and would recommend it, if you're not going to use most of its features, then you'd probably be best going for a lower model and save yourself some money.✔ Pros:✓ Easy to use.✓ Comfortable to hold.✓ Cleans teeth very well.✓ Sensors-lights are handy.✓ SmartGuide is a great feature.✖ Cons:✘ Quite Costly.✘ Doesn't remember which setting was last used.✘ Main unit doesn't sit on charging dock very snugly (wobbles if moved).",4
2489,"£200 for a toothbrush, you must be crazy!!!  Ok, so this toothbrush is very good, however, forget the app and brushing guide as it's just a gimmick - I think I've used it once.  If you can buy this item when it's reduced (it nearly always is) then as a toothbrush alone it's very good.  The charge lasts up to 14 days with one person using it twice daily and the travel case is handy. Several different modes give a variety of cleaning types and being able to change the handle colour is a fun touch.  Be aware however that if you do intend to use the app it can only be set up for one person and can't switch between users.Having said all that, my teeth feel much cleaner so it works very well and better than a manual brush....... but not £200 better!",4

A tiny amount of light can still creep through even with great care taken when putting it up.There is velcro around the edges allowing you to shrink it to size - but again its not perfect.I have had no issues with the pads not sticking or even coming off as other reviewers have experienced.Star knocked off due to slight light leak and velcro cumbersome-ness.Would recommend to a friend and if this one gets lost, we will buy another.",4

2493,"4/5 because the Bluetooth tech just shows how bad innovation is these days. I don't have an iPhone as I am someone who needs my phone for more than playing games / social spamming but this is exactly the kind of thing that really makes me lose faith in the app market. Brushing, flossing and rising is a trivial task and simple to do, if you need a book, diagram, video and now an app to teach you techniques or 'save data' then you are going to have a lot more than dental problem in your life.Saying all that the toothbrush is great, sadly it is the only one that has deep cleaning feature. You of course get unnecessary Bluetooth with it.",4

2523,A good toothbrush. Lasts around a week on full charge. I haven't bothered testing or using the bluetooth feature which I think is a bit odd and overkill for a toothbrush. A simple 2 minute warner would suffice (which I know other models have). All the standard ORAL-B heads fit.,4
2524,A good yarn well spun,4
2525,"A great holiday read, extremely gripping and only cost 99p which is a hell of a lot cheaper than a lot of the (comparative) shite I also read whilst abroad. I didn't guess the twist, which is always a bonus, and the ending was satisfying (insofar as I can't entirely remember it which means it wasn't irritating or exasperating - also always a bonus).",4
2526,A great product,5
2527,"A great product that cleans the teeth very well. Works great with the Oral-B app and I am very impressed with it. However, one small gripe that meant it did not get 5 stars is that a USB charging point would provide greater charging flexibility particularly those of us who are overseas for much of our time.",4
2528,"A great product, they really cut the light out and are portable. Occasionally they did come away from the window but in general worth the money.",4
2529,A great read of lies and deception that leads people to do things to protect their own lives really enjoyed  the way the author flicks between past events and current time unravelling the story as she goes keeps you guessing up to the end ..fantastic,4

2540,A luxury but it works well,4
2541,The cleverly written book flows continously through the past and present. A gripping book that keeps you hooked until the end.,5
2542,A must if you have children especially when the evenings are light and children struggle to get to sleep. I have bought two of these and they really help my children to sleep longer and to fall asleep much quicker in the evening. They will fit most window sizes but do check the sizing! They have stars on them which makes it look nice rather than just plain material. The downside is that I have never found the sucker caps to be very effective. Comes complete in a handy sized bag which can be used easily if you are travelling. I would recommend this product.,4
2543,"A new novel by Erin Kelly makes for a delicious prospect indeed. A back catalogue of elegant, atmospheric thrillers has firmly established Kelly as a cut above in a genre which has long since reached saturation point; deftly and intricately woven plots, immaculate characterisation and rich, evocative prose combine to elevate Kelly's tales to a different league altogether from the plethora of poorly plotted potboilers currently clogging the shelves. She brings new twists to twistlit, all imbued with a very British, very domestic, very familiar feel - but each new novel bears a motif which sets is apart from its predecessors and its contemporaries alike. In He Said/She Said, solar eclipses are the hallmark, and nothing could be more fitting given the sinister duality of this taut tale - dark and light, black and white, but which is which? And more importantly, who do we trust?Kit and Laura meet at university, their courtship defined by the polar mix of hedonistic nights and two-bar electric fires in tatty student digs. The turn of the millennium brings a wave of new-age decadence and at-oneness with the universe, and Kit's passion for chasing eclipses soon becomes Laura's. The solar eclipse of summer 1999 draws the couple to the line of totality, but as the chill daytime dusk winds scour the Cornish coast Laura witnesses a terrible crime - or does she? The repercussions of that moment will haunt her down the years, but it's not until a decade and a half later, pregnant and settled with Kit in their North London middle class idyll, that Laura realises how much is at stake - but is it too late?Kelly specialises in the past catching up in myriad terrifying ways, but in He Said/She Said she achieves this so masterfully, so insidiously, that the creeping dark shadow obliterating clarity and light seems an entirely fitting metaphor. Part thriller, part court-room drama, the novel poses difficult questions about consent and perception, and how lives can change irrevocably with just a few hastily chosen words. Kit and Laura's lives spiral out of control, but the reader is kept in jangling suspense as to who the architect of their woes actually is - damaged Beth, the fulcrum around which the drama of that fateful day in Cornwall plays out; Jamie, arrogant and cocksure, yet with the loyal support of a devoted fiancee and pillars-of-the-community family; or is the danger closer yet to home? As darkness descends and the heart-stopping denouement unfolds, the reader is left sucker-punched, stunned, breathless.The web woven around Kit and Laura spans continents and years, yet the action feels close, claustrophobic; the contrast between the wide expanse of heavens gazed upon and the intense, suffocating urgency of relationships on the edge and secrets long-guarded makes for a dizzying, disorientating read. As ever, Kelly's characters are startlingly and memorably rendered; flawed and fearful, they become increasingly unpredictable and unreliable. There is much room for empathy here, particularly in the form of the exceptionally executed Beth - but even then, the reader questions whether their first impression is the correct one. This is one of the things which makes He Said/She Said a truly great novel - the constant need to question, to re-evaluate, both the narrative and ourselves. To ask whether our perceptions can ever truly be trusted - and whether those we're closest to can also ever be absolutely deserving of the trust we bestow them with.The tension here is of the deliciously, uncomfortably slow-burn variety; the twists are judiciously peppered rather than ladled with a heavy hand, and are all the more effective and disturbing for that. The court-room scenes are especially nerve-wracking, recalling another top-class recent British thriller, Apple Tree Yard. The other pivotal moment in the narrative occurs here, changing again the course of many lives, sending all hurtling toward the final gut-wrenching conclusion. The import of Laura's actions in the dock is felt immediately, even though she cannot then know the events she has set in train; it is from here that normality begins to crumble, and the lies and secrets of all involved are drawn closer with devastating effect. The brilliance of the book does not lie entirely in its taut plotting, however - Kelly's haunting, intense prose imparts a richly brooding, atmospheric texture which gets under the skin every bit as much as the building tension.He Said/She Said is a perfect example of what happens when a thriller goes absolutely right - chilling and monstrous, affecting and challenging, this is a book which grips from its opening paragraph and doesn't relinquish its hold until long after the final page. Cleverly plotted and elegantly written, He Said/She Said effortlessly eclipses its genre-mates and is yet another triumph for Erin Kelly.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.",4

2549,"A really good tablet which is excellent value but I have docked it a star for two reasons; 1) downloaded content for journeys where wifi connection isn't possible is only available for two days once viewed, after which you have to download it again. So for family holidays away from a wifi network, when a little downtime is needed, you need to ensure that there is plenty of content downloaded to chose from. This time limit even applies to content you own! Amazon, if I own it, don't want to have to keep downloading in order to watch when away from wifi. This is a fairly big issue considering the target audience of the tablet and one of the main likely uses.2) the second reason is getting that content on so it shows up in the child's screen. For example, we own Disney's Cars, which shows in the adult screen (but only after some hunting) but not in the child screen, so it couldn't simply be downloaded from the child's screen. I resolved the issue in the end, but accessing content should be much more intuitive.The protective case is excellent, speakers great for the size of tablet, display is very good and the interface smooth and responsive.",4

2553,"A smart toothbrush complete with app for your phone comes across as one of those 21st century ideas that you see on tech shows that's all very well impressive but nobody ever asked for or needs.Well...First and foremost, it's an excellent electric toothbrush with all the modes and brush heads that you'd want. The results undeniable, it keeps a decent charge and comes with everything you need for travel etc. And then it comes with more.The smart app might be a step too far for some but there is science to it. Science is good. The app is your toothbrush coach and helps you through your routine and tracks your progress. As you would hope, it's easy to set up. Does it lead to better habits? Yes, I think it does and it perhaps makes this most mundane of tasks more interesting for kids in particular.I'm not sure that the brush itself is ideal for younger kids, mind. It comes with a warning to expect blood on the first couple of goes and that expectation was met for me. It's a powerful brush on its higher settings and with great power comes great responsibility. Although it does have pressure control that alerts you when your pushing too hard.All that said, if you've bought this far in to the idea, the Genius models with their position detection technology already make this Smart brush seem a little less clever.",4

2556,A thoroughly engrossing tale of a life seemingly ideal turned on it's head in an instant with a refreshing approach of laying out each character for the reader to engage with their very different struggles and perceptions of what he said she said and moreover how that changed them all and how they lived their lives,4
2557,A tooth brush that works perfectly well. The charger is a bit of a fiddle however.,4
2558,"A useful product. I don't know how handy it will be as not used yet.Bought for blacking out windows whilst on holiday, to enable baby to sleep.",4
2559,A very efficient toothbrush which does the job well. It is quite complicated for a toothbrush and I don't understand all of the technology that goes with it e.g. the app. The toothbrush would suit someone that likes gadgets. I choose to ignore that aspect of the toothbrush as I think it is not useful to me.,4
2560,A very good book with a twist at the end.,5
2561,A very good product when reduced to a reasonable price. Love the 2minute timer.,4
2562,A very good story that's believable and with vivid characters and some interesting twists that makes you sad. This shows you how one  mistake can change your life for good!,4
2563,"A very good tooth brush, beats the others that I have used in the past.  Leaves your teeth very clean, a good all rounder.",4
2564,"A very high quality shaver continuing the high standard of Braun. The cleaning process is a wonderful innovation, however, the warning light to clean the unit is a gimmick. The unit is switched on and off without use, and the next time you switch it on it shows the clean light - the battery does not require charging and to clean and charge continually at this point will rapidly destroy the battery life. In this modern day of technology, it would be so easy to include a circuitry that activated the clean light as the battery illuminated bar graph reaches two bars. This said, the shaver is excellent in operation and as previous Braun models, gives a clean close shave.",4
2565,"A very nice book, very well written, with a lot of suspense. An absorbing reading",5
2566,"A very slow but definite build to a gripping end,.Yet another book that would make an amazing  blockbuster film ,.",4
2567,"A well crafted book which I have given 4 stars to on the basis that it took a little while to get into and also because of the different years and characters who gave their part of the build up to the climax.Overall,a pleasing book that kept my attention.",4
2568,"A well crafted story, and as I don't want to give anything away I will just say ""wow I wasn't expecting that!"".",4
2569,A well structured story which was told with flow. I Enjoyed the book and would recommend  to anyone who likes stories with a suspense element,5
2570,"A well told story which kept me reading well into the night. The ending was not as big a 'twist' as I was expecting and seemed a bit of a let down, possibly because you had bigged it up a little too much? However I will definitely read Erin Kelly's books again.",4
2571,A well written mesmerising read. Slightly weak or cliched ending otherwise would have given it 5 stars. Well worth a try.,4
2572,A well written novel which shows you sometimes never really know someone. The story has excellent twists and turns .,4
2573,"A year on and I am still using this bad boy - Don't worry I have changed the head a fair few times! The battery life has slightly reduced over time, but nothing to extreme. Still pretty much looks the same as the day that I bought it and it keeps my teeth nice and clean!",4
2574,"After an adequate period of use, I feel I can leave an appropriate review. I must admit I was a little seduced by bluetooth functionality but on reflection, this is a bit of a gimmick.The toothbrush itself is fantastic and is available cheaper without the Bluetooth functionality. The timer is very useful and has a similar effect as the mobile health app or step counter. We become convinced to brush for a proper length of time.It is important to use the brush properly, without too much pressure or traditional brush motion- this can feel counterproductive and unconvincing initially.Over time I have noticed a definite improvement in the dental hygiene department. Used with a proper toothpaste ( I would recommend Colgate Total plus whitening), it will improve how your teeth look and feel.",4
2575,After reading some negative reviews I was a little dubious but for the offer price of £17.99 each I risked it. I ordered x 2 to cover my little girls 10ft window. Blocks out 90% and only had trouble with one of the suckers. But finally got it stuck on.  Stayed up all night and first night in months little one slept past 5 am .... ! Thank you Gro Blind ☺,4
2576,"After trying this toothbrush for a couple of weeks I am pleasantly surprised by the results.  It did take a bit of getting used to after having used a diamond clean for 2 years, but I have found the standard of cleaning achieved to be exceptional. The 'brushing too hard indicator' is really useful and the variety of brush heads included has helped me to find my perfect brush. It would be good if there was an individual brush head cap for hygiene however the brushhead storage container does mean you can easily vary which brush heads that you are using.",4
2577,"After using a manual toothbrush all my life I can see what the fuss is about when using an electric toothbrush. This gives a superior clean and I love the little digital clock indicator that you use in the bathroom, it tells you how well you cleaned your teeth and awards stars which my family have gotten quite competitive over to see who can get the 5* rating. It comes with 4 different heads for different types of cleaning.The unit it's self has a two pin plug, so if you do not have access to one, they can be cheaply bought on Amazon, which I did. It would have gotten 5 stars from me if it didn't take so long to charge. First charge up took absolutely hours to get to 3 bars. That was the most frustrating thing about it. There is an apps coming out so you can use it for your teeth brushing results with this item, depending on how important it is to you to get an update via your phone. I found it easy to use, and easy to assemble out of the box. It is a lot of money but it beats a manual toothbrush hands down.",4
2578,Alittle on the small size but still nice,3
2579,All good thanks,5
2580,"All okay,but do not use the clock or timer or app,all I want is a good toothbrush.Which this is.Quiet in operation.",4
2581,Almost didn't buy due to all the bad reviews on the new suckers. However we didn't have a single problem. I just used a good bit of spit and they stuck fast. Only issue we have had during this heat wave is that they act as radiators if the sun is shining on them.,4
2582,Almost perfect for young kids. The Kids Edition is a great package and the tablet itself works better than expected given price and intended use. Only gets four stars due to restricted apps from Amazon store - a better range and/or access to Google store would give 5 stars.,4
2583,"Almost perfect! Works well and shaves cleanly and my beard hair goes in every direction possible. Very happy, the only reason its not 4 stars because its not as perfect as razor shave...",4
2584,Also so at so good. Only used for a day but use 2 - one for iPhone 5s and it's perfect and one for iPhone 6s in a leather flip case. It holds it fine but maybe not as good as other?Good price inc next day delivery. Decent quality so far. Fits my central vent fine and the spring load graspers seem sturdy - fingers crossed,4
2585,"Although not so much better than 7 series Braun to justify all of the price difference, it cuts easier, faster and closer than any previous shavers (I've had about a dozen Braun shavers and a couple of others brands). Looks great too. Recommended.",4
2586,Although very well written I found this book was quite difficult to get into. Then half way through it really picked up pace with unexpected twists and turns. So do persevere to the end as it is worth finishing.,4
2587,always a terrific piece of kit with added benefits-head is very powerful and precise and would be protected within the great case which accompanies it-all gadgets aside an excellent performing toothbrush which really does the job,4
2588,"Always buy Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes. Never had any problems with them at all.  The replacement brushes are a little expensive imo, but I suppose you get what you pay for.  Reliable and would always recommend.",4
2589,"Amazing product, works very well but the battery life is not the greatest. Though its enough to get by the bigger problem i have found is the long charging times. Can take a day to charge which is way too  much. As is the first brush of this type ive bought its great.All the extras are maybe not needed but adds to the experience. The bluetooth to your phone was easy to set up. Allowing you to track your brushes and some further information. Great product.",4
2590,"Amazing toothbrush, good deal, parcel was late though but Customer service was responsive.",4
2591,AN ENJOYABLE READ WITH AN UNWXPECTED TWIST AT THE END.,5
2592,"An excellent toothbrush, phone app function is a bit gimmicky however. I used the phone app only once and seriously cannot see myself using my phone to brush my teeth every morning rushing to get ready.The timer thing doubled up as a much needed clock in the bathroom which is handy.",4
2593,"An expensive product, but it does feel like it has both quality and clever technology in it.  I tend towards a wet shave but often use a product like this for a bit extra or as a way of going over bits for a “second run”.  Great that this can be used in the water or dry (dry seems to get better results) and is easy to clean under running water.  Simple to use with a switch that allows you to select what areas of the face you want to shave and a nice carry case for taking it away with youThere have always been attempts to find an electric shaver that can match the closeness of a wet shave, not sure if this is the answer but it offers a robust and attractive product that will supplement your wet shave or act as an emergency top up.  I did like it, but not enough to throw away my wet shaving equipment.But definitely top end of the electric shaving market.",4
2594,"Another lovely tablet from Amazon. Lovely bumper, seems solid. But the real killer feature is the 2 year all inclusive warranty that cover anything... no questions asked... A really useful thing given my destructive granddaughter. An absolute steal at the Prime Day sales!",4
2595,"Another twisty thriller from Kelly, this is in my opinion better than ""The Poison Tree"".Often a rape case is tried on the basis of who is more believable, the question of consent is very hard to determine. There have been recent cases which echo through this book, bringing home the human impact of the news story. The writing is very tight, with almost no unnecessary detail, although I found out more than I wanted to about the scientific aspects of eclipses, other than that it is all pertinent to the story.My problem is that, as with ""The Poison Tree"", I don't much care for any of the characters in Kelly's books. She seems so keen to show all the flaws of a character that she overlooks making them likeable. In the case of Laura, the ""heroine"", she's so uptight that I don't think I'd want to meet her. Most of my sympathy went to Kit.The ending was rather weak but if this was one of those stories where it was better to journey hopefully than to arrive, it was still a pretty good few hours reading. Three and a half stars.",4
2596,App is good - keeps you focused on a quality clean,5
2597,Application is not as good and robust... Toothbrush is great,4
2598,Arrived faster than expected and exactly what was paid for,5
2599,arrived in good time nice gift thanks .,5
2600,Arrived on day it said it would for what I paid a good purchase,4
2601,"Arrived promptly and safely.  Great product, but it should have come with a sample of all the heads available.",4
2602,"Arrived promptly, well packaged and good price. Only dropped a star because Bluetooth is unnecessary and it comes with four different brush heads which I had to google to find out what each was for as it’s not in the instructions. Ordered extra brush heads on line once I knew what we needed to use. So far, very happy with my new toothbrush without the blue tooth gestapo!!",4
2603,Arrived quickly good toothbrush good value only downside is the head holder if not careful they can sit in water if you don't dry them off. The last one i owned the heads stood upright but other than that pleased with the product,4
2604,"As a night shift worker,this product was a must for me with the sunny wheather.It does its job but the suction cups could do with being smaller so i can stick it to the PVC frame rather than the glass as it still lets a bit of light through.Im sleeping alot better in a much darker room though.I would recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty sleeping in the day.",4
2605,"As a product, this is great, it does everything that it says, and this arrived on time, only once used the app, then was not interested, as I am regular in brushing, in the morning getting ready to go to work I just use my old manual brush. In the night I can take time and brush with this one, and watch the progress on the provided led gadget.",4
2606,"As expected. Bought as I had broken my arm.  Not as impressed as expected, still prefer to hand clean. PerhapsI will see the benefits after I have visited the dentist - and he tells me I don't need a deep clean.  Sorry Oral B just my opinion.",4
2607,"As I work nights, sleeping with a beam of sunlight on your face is not easy!This blind solves those problems for the most part. The blind uses suction cups to stick to the glass very securely and does a great job of blocking out the light. It would be better if it were a little bigger but does the job required.The fact this blind can be removed and easily applied elsewhere is a bonus. Great product.",4
2608,As soon as I started reading I guessed the Kit/Beth connection.  But I didn't guess the truth at the end.  I found the book enjoyable.  I liked Kit and felt sorry that a big mistake 15 years ago drove him to such extreme measures to keep a secret.  It shows how much he  did love his wife.  I would have like a happy ending.,4
2609,"At first glance this shaver doesn't seem to justify its very high price tag. The packaging doesn't look premium, the accompanying bag is not great quality and doesn't have room for the charging lead, there is no cleaning station and not even a plastic stand to keep it upright in the bathroom. The instructions apply to all the models in the range so describes several features that aren't present on this shaver, something I find quite annoying.However what really matters is the shaver, and it's not at all bad. A little heavier and larger than expected, but it gives a close and comfortable though not outstanding shave when used dry, and an excellent shave when used wet with foam, nearly comparable to a wet shave with a blade.The shaver needs cleaning after use with foam, this can be done under the tap as the shaver is waterproof. This also means the shaver can be used in the bath or shower - the idea of using it in the bath does not seem pleasant to me but in the shower all the hair will be washed away, so that seems a reasonable option. Being able to shave in the shower could 'shave' (sorry!) a couple of minutes off the morning routine too.Overall this is a good shaver which doesn't quite deserve the high price tag, but is a decent choice if you want a waterproof shaver.",4
2610,"At first I was irrated by the backwards and forwards of the narrative, but as I got into it, it didn’t spoil the story as the tension mounted. I was surprised at the ending and didn’t see it coming at all. I love a good thriller and this was certainly a page turner as the story unfolded. I would recommend it and I’m off to find more by the same author!",4
2611,At first this book was a little slow but after about halfway through I couldn't put it down. I ordered the audiobook along with it - that I wouldn't recommend. Lauras voice is whiney and has a 'poor me' fee to which I struggled to feel any sympathy to when listening to her. I didnt see the twist coming and thoroughly enjoyed the ending.,4
2612,"At first, I couldn't get into this book as I couldn't really warm to any of the characters. There was a lot of scene setting in the different times which seemed to go on forever but I stuck with it. I'm glad I did because at one point I physically gasped from a twist in the plot.",4
2613,"At the end of the day it is just a toothbrush but it cleans my teeth well and if you are looking for a new toothbrush this is a good one to invest in, I particularly like the little timer that comes with it.",4
2614,"At the start of this book I got quite confused as it was jumping to different years,but as I got into it I couldn't put it down,I have only two chapters left and there are some brilliant twists to it,highly recommended.",4
2615,Battery seems to be much better than the old model. The first time I tried it made me realise how knackered my old Braun had become. The Hygienist seems a lot happier with my teeth too since I've been using it (her bill isn't any less though!),4
2616,"Beautiful earrings, could have been presented a little better in the box. Bought as a gift",4
2617,Beautiful earrings.,4
2618,"Been using this brush for about a month now and wow what a difference. My teeth look and feel cleaner which I love. The brush handle is more chunky than my previous Oral B but I soon got use to it. As soon as I started using this brush I could really feel the difference in power and the different brush heads gets into all areas giveing a great all round clean. I can follow my progress by using an app on my smartphone, which I don't fully understand as yet, and a small clock, which stays in the bathroom, gives a reading how long I have been brushing for and a smiley face when complete correctly.Overall Brilliant, my teeth are SPARKLING.",4
2619,"Best electric razor I have owned, shaves closer than my old rotary Phillips. My only complaint is the 45 minute drying time on the clean cycle.",4
2620,birthday present they were admired,4
2621,Bit difficult to get secure in grill. Once secure holds phone in place and does its job,4
2622,"black and blindy, not quite 100%, more like 85.75% darkness however.",4
2623,Blinds arrived on time. Blinds stick well on windows although occasionally you have to stick one or two suctions caps back on. The blinds completely block the light and are a cheap alternative.,4
2624,"Blocks out most of the light but not easy to put up, the sucker pads don't always catch - and when the temperature changes on the glass they do seem to pop off.  Also I'm not very tall and it's quite a task to get it positioned well.  I'm thinking of buying some Velcro to use when at home, for ease of use!",4
2625,Blocks out the lights very well. Occasionally suckers fall off.,4
2626,Blocks out the sunlight pretty well however it does keeps falling off if one cleans or opens/closes the window; suction can be better,4
2627,"Bluetooth with a toothbrush, who would have thought it, eh?My wife has been testing this Series 6500 and it is a very good toothbrush.  It adapts to your style of brushing; how hard you press, etc.  This seems like a good idea and I guess it is.  As with most (all?) electric toothbrushes it indicates when you should move to another part of your mouth and makes sure you do your full two minutes worth of brushing.  Good idea.  I use a Philips which does the same thing.The Bluetooth mode is a little gimmicky and not something that we have really used.  You just need to download the app from the Android or Apple store, but as we've not used that mode we can't really comment on it.There are seven modes altogether, clean, white, etc but my wife has stuck to the standard clean.In the box you get three extra heads which is good, plus charging station, etc plus a clear plastic carry case.This is a good brush and is probably worth the money if you need the bluetooth connectivity but I can't help thinking you're wasting your money if you just simply want to clean your teeth.Oh, it's loud!",4
2628,"Bought an Wilko's battery toothbrush. Three push button settings. Fast, Slow, Vibrating. Light on  when charging.  Am pleased with it. £15.",4
2629,"Bought as a gift for Xmas looks good and fine price, well packaged and arrived on time advised Nancy",4
2630,Bought as a lightning deal which brought price down to same as some cheaper models in same range as such I am relatively happy would have been really upset if I had paid full price.  Apart from a timer stuck on bathroom wall which has a smiley faced on this does nothing that the cheaper models don't so you are paying an awful lot for a cheap clock.  Does leave teeth feeling clean though BUT I would say buy the cheaper models the gimmick is only interesting the first couple of uses.,4
2631,Bought as a present. Recipient pleased with it.,4
2632,Bought as a replacement brush. Works well and found the timer helpful in not having to guess the timing of segments. Overall I am very pleased with this brush.,4
2633,"Bought as a with a new bathroom we needed 2 brushes, one for the kids in new bathroom one for us.  Rather than buying a cheap model for them we gave them our old unit and got this for ourselves.It works really nicely, my wife says it's like going to the hygienist (not sure about that).  The display is a nice feature but a bit of a gimmick and the Bluetooth(TM) is no good as the app isn't compatible with my device.The downsides, the charge indicator is a bright blue light, a bit of a shock tripping to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  The charge unit itself has changed again.  Our old unit had a sort of loop that the brush sat in with a long soft cord.  This model has the ""old"" upright pole and a much shorter stiffer lead, a bit of a pain to site compared to the previous version.",4
2634,"Bought during a recent promotion, assembled in a few minutes and working like a charm. The brush seems to be powerful and efficient in cleaning and all in all delivers good value for money at £55",4
2635,"Bought for my 5 year old daughter. Simple setup, full of content straight out the box which includes educational apps as well as entertainment. The case definitely looks and feels like it will handle many drops. Only thing I would have liked to have been different would have been for it to be able to be fully a kids tablet rather than having a full fire experience for the parent and having to switch to child mode every time it’s switched on so 4 out of 5 stars. Oh and don’t forget the content lasts 12 months from purchase/setup before you have to pay a subscription!",4
2636,"Bought it after reading the reviews. Doesn't shave as I  expected as I  still need a razor to remove hair on top of the upper lip and also under the bottom lip despite going over several times. As for being the best shaver,  I'm not sure.It's not a bad shaver but definitely not the best.",4
2637,Bought it for my 2 year old as his bedroom gets afternoon and evening sun which is difficult for nap time and bedtime. Its very handy in terms of use - adjustable velcro to accomodate window dimensions and suction cups which stick very well (hasn't fallen down yet!). It is very effective in darkening the room - in fact my 2 yr old complained the room was too dark so I had to adjust it so some light still came through. It also takes some of the heat out of the sun so his room isn't as hot which is more comfortable for him.We are planning on taking it with us when staying at his grandparents house and I imagine it will be as effective there also!,4
2638,"Bought this as my husband works night shift and was struggling to sleep through the day. This blind is amazing for blocking out the brightness of the day and literally made the room pitch black. We did have to buy a tension rod to put it up as the suction pads are rubbish, but definitely worth the money.",4
2639,"Bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas as she was always playing on my phone, so I thought I’d i got this I would get control of my phone back!My daughter hasn’t yet got the idea of how it works as it is obviously different to what she’s used to on the phone. To be honest, I like my gadgets but I also find the kindle layout quite confusing at times and don’t find it particularly intuitive.As I’m sure you know, you can’t get YouTube kids on this which my daughter loves so she still uses my phone for that, but I have downloaded films and games for her to play which she enjoys, I think she’ll get more use from it when she’s a little older (she’s only 27 months) as she’ll be able to look around it herself a bit more rather than just relying on the what she sees on the screen in front of her.I have mine and my husbands kindle profiles set up on there too so we can borrow it when she goes to bed!4 stars as it is a great product.",4
2640,"Bought this for my daughters sleepover as we don't have curtains up yet! Suction not as good as I hoped and room not as dark, but overall glad we had it.",4
2641,Bought this for my husband as a replacement for a much older electric brush and he is delighted with his gift.  The tooth brush is easy to use and clean.  It also comes with a very handy stand which will hold other tooth brush heads making it ideal for the whole family to use,4
2642,Bought this in Amazon deals. Have used my current Oral B electric brush for many years and thoroughly trust it but may be close to renewal. I saw this at the right price. Delivered next day and for free. Easy set up and charge it works brilliantly as you would expect. Only slight irritant is the flashing blue charging light.,4
2643,Bought this on Amazon Prime Day as it was cheaper than lower models. I've used other models of the brush for years and really like them - so much so that I got his for travelling as normal toothbrushes just don't seem to feel as good...The separate display is a handy bathroom clock. The whole bluetooth thing and the smartphone app is more than a little gimmicky though - I definitely wouldn't spend the extra just for this. Might be fun for a small child though...,4
2644,"Bought this to keep our kids asleep when staying away from home. It works perfectly. Yes, the suckers need a lick of spit to stick on properly, and some still come off. But once stuck it doesn't come down. We use it for ourselves when we travel too. We've had it for a couple of years, using on and off, but still doing its job - keeping us asleep!!",4
2645,"Bought this to replace my 8 year old daughter's Ittle kids 7"" tablet which she's had for 3 years. I couldn't see the point of replacing it with the same size, so this 8"" one seemed a good choice.I like it and she loves it - the slightly larger screen makes a big difference, and the colours are vibrant and picture quality is very sharp. The sound is excellent, better than any tablet I've used myself. The only thing that lets the viewing experience down is the reflection on the screen, but I guess this is a common issue. A non-reflective screen would have been so much nicer.I'm not a huge Amazon user (ie don't have Prime etc.) but this was easy to set up - so long as you have internet! Without a connection it's pretty useless, which was a pity because we gave it to her for her 8th birthday on a campsite without internet! I had downloaded a book beforehand so at least she could have a little go with it, but other than that she had to wait until we returned home before I could set it up properly and download more stuff.The choice of stuff is very good with a seemingly endless choice of books, apps and web videos taken from YouTube but without all the YT paraphernalia. Plenty of educational things on there which you could spend days hunting out on the web yourself. Some brilliant learning apps too which we've downloaded to help her maths, and she's having fun using them.The speed is very good and Minecraft works so much better than on her other tablet. The memory is large for this size tablet, so we don't have to worry about her filling this one up with her photos and videos. Having an expandable memory is also an important feature.On the Minecraft note - this had to be purchased (£4.99) via my account from the Amazon App store and then shared to her profile. Very easy to do.All in all a great tablet and I can recommend it. If you can stretch your budget, definitely go for the 8"" over the 7.",4
2646,"Bought to try and get a few hours more sleep on bright mornings as my toddler was waking up way to early.Easy to put up although the suckers do sometimes un-stick during the night and let the sun shine through. There are also lots of gaps at the edge of the window even when all the Velcro bits are done up due to window size. If you have quite a large window I think this blind would work fine, not so good for small windows but still does an adequate job.",4
2647,Bought two for two different size windows. Works very well. Blacks  out blind and stays on windows,4
2648,Braun never fail to impress and this recent version maintains that standard. It's the third or fourth Braun electric toothbrush which I have had and I would not buy any other.,4
2649,Bril,4
2650,"Brilliant blind did it's job.Great item can be stored away easily till you need it small neat bag,can travel well without any space.",4
2651,"Brilliant idea and works well on almost all window sizes. I've found its not great on slanted windows as the suction cups sometimes give way. Other than that, it's fantastic at blocking out the light. Essential in the summer.",4
2652,Brilliant present for my daughter and the price was good as a special offer,4
2653,Brilliant product but the suction pads did lose stick a lot.,4
2654,Brilliant product while it lasted. Unfortunately after 3 months of use the suction cups wouldn't hold anymore.,4
2655,"Brilliant tablet, keeps the kids entertained for ages and the free year subscription to the fire for kids unlimited if fab.Only negative is google apps are not supported so you can easily get things like you tube for kids.",4
2656,Brilliant the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the plastic suckers sometimes release themselves from the window.The quality is very good and keeps out 95% of the daylight when I am trying to get some sleep in the day as I work at night.,4
2657,Brilliant toothbrush,4
2658,"Brilliant toothbrush with very good battery life. However, the Bluetooth function and digital display are somewhat pointless and I have never found any use for them whatsoever. I feel if this company focused just on the brush alone.. I would be giving this a 5 star.",4
2659,"Brilliant, but don't bother with the Bluetooth bit which adds costs however very little value. I bought this for the various heads, travel and head action. My teeth feel cleaner.",4
2660,"Brilliant, daughter loves it.",4
2661,"Brilliant. So many functions. Plus, it's a toothbrush that gives out to you! Perfect if you've just moved out of home and miss your parents.",4
2662,Brought as a gift for my daughter lovely little tablet for kids she absolutely loves it. It did stop working when I first turned it on and had to call amazon but they were happy to exchange but it sorted its self in the end anyway so I didn’t need to send it back. Only thing is I wish there was a lock on the home page of the kids profile so when the toddler is playing on it there not able to just download loads of stuff so easily and could only access the already downloaded stuff but apart from that it’s brilliant for children.,4
2663,Brought as a present and although they are a bit smaller than i was expecting they are very nice,4
2664,"Brought this for our young granddaughter for when she stays with us. She is difficult to get to sleep when the sun is shining, this helps to settle her a lot quicker and she does not wake so early in the morning.",4
2665,"Can only give four stars as the suction cups are pretty useless as some have said, but if you can get it to stay put, or use some Velcro etc. to stick it in place, the blind does exactly as it's meant to do. The actual quality to seems really good on it, so it does look like it'll take a beating if used a lot. Persevere with it, and it'll do wonders.",4
2666,can't get the suction cups to stay up but it might just be me.,4
2667,Can’t get the child settings to do what I want but everything else really good.,4
2668,Canny.,4
2669,Captivating more so when it was apparent what Kit had actually done. I enjoyed the twist in the sense that the impression of Beth was encouraged at the beginning and things just changed to feeling very sorry for her. Wished the ending wasn't so abrupt with the final twist being uncovered.,4
2670,"Case works fairly well - though not rigid enough to keep it facing angling the driver (guess depends on the rigidity of you car's air vent grill).  Will tilt well though and means can switch to be horizontal or upright easily.  One thing found useful is that I can detach the phone with one hand.  One drawback is that if accelerating fast, it has fallen off (twice) but most of the time fine.  Overall would buy again.",4
2671,Child mode is a little to strong have to have an adult account on it to save films of the pc to as card very tough and not been broken yet,4
2672,"Cleans well and is very light compared to my previous Oral B toothbrush. The mobile Bluetooth functionality is a bit gimmicky, I have only used it once or twice. The battery seems to go about 2 weeks before it needs to be recharged. Having multiple brush heads for different functions is unique to Oral B and a welcome bonus.",4
2673,Cleans well though the battery leaves alot to be desires. Having to charge it every 2-3 days and takes forever to charge.,4
2674,"Comes in such a tiny bag but it's huge! More than enough for my sons window, but pleased I got it as the sun comes up his side of the house and I already had blackout curtains so I didn't want to pay out for a blind when this one can be taken down as well as taking it on holiday! Great buy!",4
2675,comes in very handy when travelling,4
2676,Comes with a 2 pin plug charger for shaving sockets only. Given that we no longer live in the 90's and houses don't build these into bathrooms anymore it is somewhat frustrating. Having to purchase plug adapter.,4
2677,"Comfortable, ergonomic shape, easy to hold and useQuick charge battery with long life between chargesRetains constant power level right up to the point of rechargeFlexible head gives comfortable shave (previous Braun fixed head shavers made skin sore)Gives a close chave with no soreness/ rashGreat with longer stubble; no pulling or catchingDoesn't leave stray hairsEasy to clean and empty when dryGreat shaver, worthy of a premium price, but not great value at the current price on Amazon...",4
2678,"Complex well, developed characters? Check. Solid plotline? Check. Clever formatting? Check. What an intriguing book!Kit and Laura go to view a solar eclipse and witness a sexual attack. Fifteen years later, they are living in fear, having changed their names and their lives to stay safe. But what if they were wrong about what they saw?While I wouldn't classify this as a psychological thriller, it does explore the characters and their development so well, has enough twists to keep you guessing, and is such a compelling read with an ending I was truly surprised by.",4
2679,Complicated and moving.an interesting read,4
2680,Complicated instructions but cleans lovely,4
2681,comprehensive package working fully!,4
2682,"Conclusion, the way that little lies can twist and turn our lives ,enthralling, a very good read incredibly thought provoking.",4
2683,Cons:This product doesnot have a tounge cleaning mode.Take ages to fully charge the baterryPros:Rest all the function works perfectly as described.,4
2684,"Convenient, easy and when put up properly offers excellent darkness however if it's sunny blind acts as a radiator and is very hot to touch so don't recommend in west facing rooms. Mine actually cracked the window pane at my in-laws house but I believe that's the exception rather than the rule!",4
2685,"Could have made clearer that it was a European connection. Needed to buy the adapter separately. Apart from that, brilliant!",4
2686,Couldn't get it to successfully stick to the window using the suckers but draped it over a wire I already have in the window for net curtains and it keeps the light out really well using it this way.,4
2687,Couldn't put the kindle down . A real page turner !!,4
2688,Covers window well and blocks out light. a little bit of a faff to make smaller for smaller sized Windows but I'd be complaining if it wasn't big enough for a bigger window! Only complaint is that it makes the room become very hot in the morning/if using at nap time,4
2689,"Daughter delighted with the Fire kid but after two days I noticed she does not play on it anymore... I took a look at it myself and realised most APPS (books, games etc) appear to be (stuck) downloading from our fast fibre broad band... hours later the apps (even just one at a time) still appear to be stuck and spinning icon? do I have a faulty Fire or is this a known issue? anyone got the customer service email please?",4
2690,"Daughter played for 1hour then the thing stopped working!! Called amazon who tried to troubleshoot and get it working without success so they sent new one out next day, my daughter plays in it loads and loves it, easy to use, plenty of storage.. great customer service from Amazon!! Will be buying another for my other daughter for Christmas 😊",4
2691,Definitely a great idea and essential when we moved house and didn't have curtains in the bedroom yet. However I found that even if you place the suction cups right to the edge of the glass (doesnt stick to frame) the fabric doesn't sit flush against the glass so there is still a slight gap where light pours through. So early in the morning there's a border of light all around the blinds. Enough to illuminate the room. Thus these blinds are not enough to keep my sensitive baby asleep past sunrise! Grr,4
2692,Definitely a page turner pretty much fromStart to finish,4
2693,"Definitely blacks out my room. However, the suction cups (at the corners) don't always seem to like to stick on my window....which can be a bit of an issue.",4
2694,Definitely blocks out the light. Will need two to put it up.,4
2695,delicate and good price,4
2696,Delighted,4
2697,"Delivery good, well packaged and the product has ticked all the boxes so far as it is early doors and I haven't had very long. Fits into the air vent well very sturdy and the grip for my phone is also good, Was a bit worried about that as the S7 is not a small phone but this product holds it firmly without the worry of going over a bump in the road and your phone flying out! I like how you can rotate your phone as well. Would recommend well done Mpow.",4
2698,"Dentist recommended getting  an electric toothbrush and bought this in a sale.  really good brush, not interested in the bluetooth / phone app side of things (you can post your teeth brushing skills online if you really want to) but does the job nicely.  comes with a few additional heads to play with.",4
2699,"Despite Amazon cocking-up the delivery (which they refunded) the blind is execllent. It was expensive but it does exactly what it says. The suckers worked OK, it was wide enough, overlong (for the windows I wanted covering). Indeed it was so good I cancelled my return.",4
2700,"Despite the range of reviews on Amazon I found this product to be quite good. The suckers work perfectly well enough on glass (but not UPVC window frame). It is a bit fiddly when you first put it up, but each subsequent time has been much easier. Also gives you the option to block out as much light as you/your child is comfortable with.",4
2701,Didn't see that coming!,4
2702,Didn't see the twist,4
2703,"Didn't work at all in our old place, wouldn't stick. Now works well in our new place, assume the difference could be down to the window - single glazing (doesn't stick) vs double glazing (does stick)?",4
2704,"Disappointed it didn't come with a normal plug, only comes with shaver plug.",4
2705,Do the job but the suckers that attach to the window aren't great. I'm regularly having to restick them.,4
2706,"Does a good job, holds the phone in place.  It does occasionally pop off the air vents but I haven't found any phone holder that's perfect for that yet - this is the best of the lot.  Doesn't help in this case that the vent is circular (Audi A1) so with straight vents  it will be far more effective.  A good buy though, good quality.",4
2707,"Does a good job. I use two to completely cover my window and am very happy with it. I don't use the sticky things in comes with, but rather use the windows itself to put it into place.",4
2708,Does as it  says,4
2709,Does exactly as described.,4
2710,"does exactly what it should, holds the phone in place perfectly. using it with both a samsung galaxy s7 in a spigen case, and a microsoft nokia lumi 650 in a case. can be removed easily, perfect for use in multiple cars or use in a hire car.",4
2711,"Does exactly what it's supposed to, has a firm grip and is easy to use!",4
2712,Does not feel as slick as an iPad but with the 2 year warranty and loads of pre-loaded apps me & baby are both happy.,4
2713,"Does sometimes fall down but not as bad as some of the reviews I read prior to purchasing, you just got to make sure it's really really stuck on. Came in very handy when my actual blinds fell down in my little ones room.",4
2714,Does the job - will be useful for holidays and peace of mind even when our little boy is older. Or even for us - so many places don't have good curtains! Thick material and a good size.,4
2715,Does the job but falls off some times,4
2716,Does the job but it is quite heavy.This means it can be difficult to stick to window but really does stop the light so worth the effort. My grandson doesn't wake up at 4 am when he comes to stay lol!,4
2717,"Does the job but sticking the suction cup proves a little more complicated -- not sure why. I wish they had sizes to accommodate gigantic windows. I bought two and there are some blind spots; and, there is no point buying third for tiny spaces -- light rays!!!",4
2718,Does the job but we did find it kept coming unstuck. Maybe the window wasn't clean enough but I don't want to arrive on holiday and have to clean a window!!!!,4
2719,Does the job if you're travelling but we tried to use it at home and because of the hassle of putting it up and getting it to fit we just ended up leaving it day and night which was very depressing. Invest in a fitted blind,4
2720,"does the job, maybe a bit too technical for me",4
2721,Does the job. Very pleased.,4
2722,Does what is says on the box!,4
2723,Does what it is intended for.,4
2724,Does what it is surprised to,4
2725,Does what it say on the tin!,4
2726,"Does what it says on the bag, although if the windows are on the smaller side, due to the weight of the blind, it doesnt tend to stick particularly great",4
2727,Does what it says on the box.,4
2728,"Does what it says on the tin, mounts well into my vent (Subaru Forester) and holds my iPhone really well, no concern about it slipping out",4
2729,Does what it says on the tin!Arrived promptly!,4
2730,Does what it says on the tin.  Brilliant.,4
2731,"Does what it says on the tin. It sometimes falls to pieces when removing the phone which is annoying, but can't fault the grip!",4
2732,does what it says though disappointed I could only attach to glass and not surrounding frame.,4
2733,Does what it's expected to do,4
2734,does whatit says on the tin,4
2735,Doesn't quite fit properly on the vent (VW golf 2017) but it stays on just a bit wonky,4
2736,Doing a good job so far,4
2737,Dramatic with good sparkle,4
2738,"Durable, darkens the room as advertised but leaves a few holes hence some light does sneak in the room. The  best work around was to buy a strip of velcro and stick all along the window edge then stick the velcro on this blind along that velcro. Works a treat.Prompt delivery and a very nice product. Would order again for sure",4
2739,E joyed the twists in this. Easy to read and good characters to get into the heads of. Will read her stuff again.,4
2740,Earing looking bigger than they are in real,4
2741,"Easy to adjust, total blackout and looks nice.",4
2742,Easy to assemble as just sticks to window with suction cups. Stays up well. Doesn't totally block all the light but darkens room compares to normal blinds/curtains.,4
2743,"Easy to carry, very handy and makes the room dark when used. Make sure to get the right size and that is it.",4
2744,Easy to fit and does the job.Can take on holiday too.,4
2745,Easy to follow plot. Likeable characters. Twists and turns along the way to keep you interested. Enjoyable and would recommend,4
2746,Easy to read with unexpected twist,4
2747,"Easy to read, felt a bit impatient to get to the point....well written with good twists. Would read another book from Erin kelly",4
2748,Easy to read. Always leaves you in suspense. Love the twists and turns.,4
2749,Easy to set up and use. Baby loves the bottle that comes with this set. Would have gotten 5 stars but valve broke after a couple months. Nevertheless called customer service who were wonderful enough to send me spares free of charge. Another point is if you can invest in the double as sometimes the single gets a abit tedious pumping on one breast then having to swap and start pumping on the next breast.,4
2750,Easy to use and blocks out light perfectly. Only reason for me not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit tricky folding it so it fits back into the bag (but with practise I'll probably figure out a way).,4
2751,"Easy to use. Only problem some of the suction pads don't stick properly, even though window has been cleaned and suction pad moistened. Other than that, it's great.",4
2752,"Edit: Initial issue resolved via helpdesk call. Not clear why it stopped working so hopefully a ""one off"" that won't be repeated.The tab it self is great value. I realy like the way I can control what is on my sons account so I can relax when he is using it. The UI is simple and intuitive and so far the battery life is pretty impressive. Simple games and videos run smoothly and the 32gb internal drive puts many other tabs to shame.  So far so good. Probably would have put a five star review if it were not for the initial issue.",4
2753,"Ending has a great twist.  This book is great for a holiday read but I did find the beginning rather slow and seemed to jerk back and forth a little too much and I felt a little lost in the plot.The ending is great - really liked that, it sort of took my breath away.",4
2754,engaging  hard to put down read,4
2755,Enjoyable,4
2756,"Enjoyable book, different from the usual thrillers.  Apart from the poison tree by Erin Kelly this was my favourite so far.",4
2757,"Enjoyable to read, good twist at the end. Really like the writing style of the author. I Would certainly recommend.",4
2758,Enjoyed it was hard to put down at times,4
2759,"Enjoyed reading it , got you gripped up until the end",4
2760,Enjoyed the book - not everything as it seems on the surface,4
2761,"Enjoyed this book a lot, couldn't put it down!Really liked the fact that the book changed perspectives, meaning you got an insight into each character. Going back and forth in time also made it interesting. Was a bit sad with how it ended so abruptly but all in all a great read!",4
2762,enjoyed this book but found the ending a little stilted,4
2763,Enjoyed this book.,4
2764,Erin Kelly is the kind of author that makes me wish I could write like that myself.  A brilliant read.,4
2765,Even on my stiff suspension rattley car this holds my phone firmly over rough roads.Bit awkward to fit phone onto - a two-hand job.Would suggest caution in fitting as I have broken a couple of the vanes on my vent.,4
2766,everything good except the stupid apps,4
2767,"Excellent blinds, got them for both my children's rooms and they sleep so much better with them up. Only trouble is sometimes they come unstuck  in a corner, letting light in and waking them. This is usually avoided by sticking them well in the first place (a bit of spit does the trick!) A bit of a pain having to put them up every night but once the mornings are darker again we won't need them over the winter.",4
2768,"Excellent brush,best I've had,powerful,feels like it's done the job when you've finished",4
2769,Excellent gift for grandchildren,4
2770,Excellent item and great for my sons bedroom as just outside of his window is a very bright streetlight. My only issue is that the suckers sometimes loose suction which is annoying as his bedroom is a box so I have to climb in his cot to stick me back down.,4
2771,"Excellent parental tool! Looking for a replacement babysitter? Someone to take on your responsibilities as a parent, to nurture your child and make them grow into a well rounded, well mannered and well educated child? Look no further than the fire tablet by Amazon.This tablet suits the needs of many parenting styles, such as those parents who think children should be seen and not heard like me. Stick this in front of them, and as described by other reviewers, it will keep your child entertained for hours. Are you someone who loves social media so much more than socialising with your offspring? Never be distracted from your own mobile phone screen again by children who want stuff, like food.I coupled my purchase with a range of automatic cat food dispensers, and automated pet drinks fountains. Just load them up with happy meals and Pepsi, set the timer to feed and 'water' them two times a day and bingo, you don't even have to be at home with them.I love this product so much, I would have given it 5 stars but have to agree with the reviewer below who said the battery life could do with being longer. I expect to be able to stick this device in front of the brats at 8 o'clock in the morning, and the battery last until I send them to bed at midnight. When the battery runs out, I actually have to communicate with them. And that is not why I had children.",4
2772,"Excellent product - comes with a range of brush heads.Not sure about the bluetooth and connecting to phone/app to track your brushing - I don't think many people will use that feature. The bluetooth does seem to consume the battery a fair bit so you may want to consider getting the Pro5000 (without bluetooth).Overall, a very good tooth brush.",4
2773,Excellent product and really does work well. Would fully reccommend for use during the Summer months. Only draw back is ease of putting it up. It only goes on to the actually window itself with the suckers and they don't go on that easily. I thought maybe there would be some hooks so you could leave the suckers in place and hook it back on which would have been better.,4
2774,Excellent product but then it should be for the price (significantly reduced). Works well and gives good results however have to question the pricing for these products as using a good toothpaste and hand brush would probably yield the same results.  However timer is great for encouraging the kids to brush for the required time!!,4
2775,excellent product happy with my purchase..,4
2776,"Excellent product like other Kindle Fire purchased before.  My only request would be that I should have the control to add you tube or other websites to the allowed list if I wanted to, however it doesn't seem to let you only a video at a time which is not that easy to do.",4
2777,"Excellent product, 1 star taken off as it really should be USB chargeable in this day and age.Who has a 2 pin plug socket in the bathroom! Or even the space to have a charging station for a tooth brush.There are so many advantages to having a USB chargeable system.",4
2778,"Excellent product, modes are a bit of a gimmick but good training to ensure you wash every part of your teeth. Battery is okay.",4
2779,Excellent quality. However timer has already broken.,4
2780,"Excellent toothbrush, Bluetooth computer is great if you've got time on your hands and need to entertain yourself in the morning, but if your like me and always in a hurry then this is a waste of time",4
2781,"Excellent toothbrush, not so excellent instructions..",4
2782,"Excellent, overall. Unfathomably the design has no stand, so you have to constantly prop it up the whole time. I belatedly understand it would have been cheaper to buy a standard Fire, and buy a case separately and still run the kids stuff.",4
2783,Excellent. Similar to hospital one I used. Much easier than the manual one and I get a free hand. Gets two let down of milk in 5-10mins and so a full bottle if neededDownsides are you have to lean forward (that is true of most).  The batteries need to be replaced if using without power. It makes a humming noise if switched on even not in use.,4
2784,Excelllant product,4
2785,exellent quality,4
2786,expected the full range of brush heads,4
2787,Extremely handy and still use it as permanent blind in my sons nursery. Velcro system works well and suction cups hold blind firmly to window with ease. Great product.,4
2788,Extremely satisfied with the razor. Excellent product but a little overpriced.,4
2789,Fairly gripping,4
2790,Fantastic pair of earrings! Look beautiful on and the recipient was over the moon to receive would consider for myself :),4
2791,Fantastic that you now get tech when you brush your teeth! Toothbrush connects to the app on your device and logs your brushstroke pressure and timing to help promote and keep great oral hygiene. The toothbrush itself has seriously good cleaning power and gets you plaque within a few weeks and a bit of practise.  If your looking for a non sonic toothbrush I definitely recommend this one.,4
2792,"Fantastic toothbrush ,only down points  are a bit fidly to use and you do need to read the manual and didnt really see any improvement on the whitening side but teeth felt and looked cleaner .Also gums felt tingly and healthy",4
2793,"Fantastic toothbrush at the newly reduced price and one that's worth buying even if you want to ignore the 'bluetooth technology' angle which holds no interest to me and just seems gimmicky however; the ability to connect your toothbrush to your phone, or other device, to get feedback on your brushing technique might be something you'd appreciate having. It does work.There are 6 different brushing choices on the handle plus a range of timers which will alert you when the brush needs moving on to different teeth. It's all very simple to use and understand. More importantly my teeth feel really clean after using the brush for approx ten weeks.Battery life isn't great. The brush requires regular charging for long periods if you want to brush at optimum speed. Charger is included but it's the usual rickety, plastic unit common to all electric toothbrushes. The carry case is also very basic.Look out for the price of replacement brushing heads. There are 4 in the box and each one should last for a few months but; they're not cheap to buy.More than happy to recommend at the newly reduced, sensible, price. I just don't like the 'gimmicky' technology that comes with it.",4
2794,"Fast clean shave, can miss a few hairs that come out at angles but briliiant apart from that.The best shave i've had from an electric...",4
2795,"Fast delivery and at a great price, these were bought as a birthday present, only downside hence the 4 stars as it would be nice if they came in a presentation box rather than a small plastic bag.",4
2796,"Fast delivery, good product, fits a iPhone 6s Plus and holds in air vent of Audi TT. More than happy with the product! Didn't give it 5star, just because of the button that undose the clip from the holder, most times it comes off when not being pressed.",4
2797,Fast delivery. Excellent product,4
2798,Fast paced read with plenty of twists and turns. Very enjoyableWith tension right to the end and quirky but believable characters.,4
2799,Few flaws in the actual legalities but still a really good read,4
2800,Few too many instructions for my husband’s liking but works very well indeed.,4
2801,Finally a gripping thriller I could really enjoy.Starts slowly though so you have to persevere.The denouement was worth it though in my opinion and I would recommend.,4
2802,Fine,4
2803,First book purchased by this author - really enjoyed it.,4
2804,"First I want to say that the Pro 6000 works well at its primary function, cleaning teeth, and it holds a very good charge. But I'm really not sure about rest of the package, and have the feeling that manufacturers are asking themselves what new features can be included to somehow justify the prices of such products. The smiley face 'Smart Guide' remote brushing timer display is surely no more than a gimmick, and one that would only amuse a child for a few days. Other makers, and Braun themselves, are able to incorporate such timers in the body of the device, so it's hard not to conclude that it exists entirely to differentiate the Pro 6000 from competing products.In conclusion, I think it's a good present for the gadget fiend, and undeniably effective, but equally good results could be obtained at a far lower price point.",4
2805,"First impressions - will try to update later.First time did take a good 5-10 minutes for a few reasons: I was getting used to it (first foil shaver I've had since I was about 14-16, i.e. maybe 20 years!); I had countless stray hairs and patches of well grown hair from not properly looking after my old one, it not generally being very good with neck hair etc, and just kind of waving it around my face on most mornings; and as is reasonably well known (and the manufacturer will state if asked) the shaver itself 'wears in' to your individual face/skin over the course of a few days to a couple of weeks.  First time immediately needed a 3 droplet level clean!My skin was quite irritated, but I'd expect that after going at it for 10 minutes.Second time only took a minute or so, much better.  Can tell it's not quite worn in yet and I have the same level of mild irritation as if I'd wet shaved (I think my face is not used to this close a shave very often though!), but certainly didn't need all of yesterday's effort.  Glided around like nothing I've known before - the ~20 old rotary (which if was on Amazon, I'd give 5 stars just for being something you can use for life) seems like taking a disc sander to my face by comparison.If you've only known cheap / old electric shavers, this is really something else.  Honestly my face feels about the same as if I'd wet shaved with a razor, I can't really tell the difference.  My old one was capable of close to that, but only if I went over and over for 5-10 minutes, at which point you might as well just use a razor.I do have quite light hair (in both colour and density) and have heard that those with tougher beards might be best off with the Philips 9000 series.Others have noted that if you have more than a few days growth you're probably going to run into difficulties, like with my first shave where some patches were equivalent to a week or more of growth and took a lot of going over and some assistance from the trimmer.  Personally I suspect this is just the Achilles heel of foil shavers (the benefit being a closer and gentler shave as long as you keep on top of it daily) - think about it, you're relying more on your hairs being short enough to stand upright and poke through the foil.  If they're long, they're not going to do that.  The special 'hyper lift' part or whatever they call it helps, but it won't work miracles. If you've left it more than about 3 days, it's probably worth keeping an old/cheap rotary on standby since those approach your hairs from the side, or probably more comfortably, just have a wet razor shave and start again.Knocking off a star just for the completely pointless and cynical cleaning indicator (apparently the 7 series had a more informative screen, oddly.  I'd have gone for that model, but this was a great price at £150, the 7 was £175 and it feels wrong to pay more for an older model).  It doesn't ""know"" that it's dirty and light up when it really needs a clean, it simply lights up automatically after 1 use.  It's clearly just a ploy to try and get you to put it through the cleaner every day and use more cartridges.  I also don't believe for a moment that the cleaner ""analyses"" it in any way, and imagine there's just an internal count of the number of minutes of on-time between cleans.  I'd be curious to know for sure, but the indicator on the shaver doesn't give me any confidence that there's any more logic in the cleaning unit.  I'd just ignore the indicators, rinse it out manually most of the time and just pop it through the cleaner say once a week.",4
2806,"First off I got this on a lightning deal and I still think it's overpriced.It's a great toothbrush, far better than a manual (I've been manual for a long time, this was my first electric toothbrush). It gives a great clean, it's just packed with completely useless features, like the Bluetooth. I've never used it and probably never will. Out of the 6 modes, I've only ever used two. The battery life is OK... However I'm still at a loss to explain how this toothbrush takes so long to charge, it takes 24 hours... An electric car battery only takes 12 hours to charge up from empty!All in all, if you have the money it's a good toothbrush, however the less expensive models do the same thing for much less.",4
2807,"First time I'd read this author, and enjoyed this most out of a bunch of Kindle books I was reading, so now on a second one",4
2808,First time with an audio-book. OK so it frees you up but just so long (over 12 hrs) and if you fall asleep it's not so easy to reread a passage. The book itself is quite clever. I chose it following hearing a review on the radio and I wasn't disappointed. I think a good bit of editing could have firmed it up a bit. Good plot very clever execution enjoy the read.,4
2809,"First we had sonic toothbrushes; now we have sonic shavers. I'm not sure how the SyncroSonic part of the 9040s is supposed to work, but outwardly and performance-wise it doesn't appear to be much different to other foil shavers.The box the 9040s comes in is small, rattles around disconcertingly and isn't that impressive considering the high price tag. The shaver itself is solid, smart and nice-looking. Braun tends to excel when it comes to two things: build quality and motor strength/rechargeable batteries, and this shaver is no exception.The shaving performance is good, but not astounding. It doesn't appear to be too different to (and probably it's slightly worse than) the Philips rotary shaver I was using. I do like the travel case it comes with. So many shavers don't come with any kind of case, and I like having a protective travel case that's specific to the device's shape.Braun's 9040s is a good, solid foil shaver that works well but doesn't seem that ""premium"". I think it's overpriced at the moment. I suspect the price of it will come down fairly rapidly.",4
2810,"Fits easily into vent, stays in place.",4
2811,Fits perfectly & simply.,4
2812,Fits well in my Fiat 500.,4
2813,"For many years, I've found foil headed shavers far less effective and comfortable than the Philips rotary systems.As a dry shaver it produces a decent result on my wiry stubble. Used with shaving foam, it produces a very good shave.The multidirection floating head makes this far better than any other foil headed shavers, as it certainly covers lots of my face very effectively however,.claims from Braun that you don't need to go over the same area twice, didn't hold water for me.There is a switch to lock the head in place, which some reviewers seem to have been confused over, thinking it is some sort of wet/dry setting. Reading the manual helps! I prefer the head to float and change angle, but I can see that some people will prefer the fixed feel.After wet shaving with ordinary shaving foam it is essential to wash out the shaver under hot running water.It doesn't have a stand, so when put onto bathroom tiles while still wet, it has a tendency to trap water under itself because of its shape.The sideburn trimmer on the back is easy to use and produces a neat result.One complete charge is enough for me to shave for a month. It has a good scale to tell you its charge level. When it gets very low, it beeps very quietly.This shaver is only a little heaver than the higher end Philips shavers that it competes with and produces almost as good a result.",4
2814,For someone like me who works at night this product is a lifesaver... finally the bedroom is totally dark! Did not give five star because the suckers were a little bent out of shape in the original packaging. With use and by following the detailed instruction in the bag is very easy  to bring them backto their original shape,4
2815,"For the money these earrings are a good purchase. They must be silver because I can wear them without taking them off each day, and they don't irritate my ears. Nice bling for a small price.",4
2816,For the price can't complain. Does what it says on the tin.,4
2817,"Four stars out of five overall, the actual toothbrush is five star. One star lost because this is a very expensive piece of kit and the gimmick of the timer just adds to the price and nothing to the functionality. You get a box full of stuff. Our usual electric toothbrush is a simple sub-£30 item that does a decent job. Added to a simple on/off switch, this one has a bluetooth connection and a clock/programme checker. All it really does is remind you to change to another quandrant typically after 30 secs of brushing. Personally, even I'm not that daft that I need that help despite clocking up more that 60 years.In the box you get a sample of each one of the four different brush heads. The sensitive one is the size of the ones I'm used to. The others are bigger and are tailored for different types of brushing. In addition there is a holder for the brush heads and that fairly pointless timer. I did not bother with the app as that too is nothing more than a gimmick. What was perfectly clear after one go is that this does the important bit brilliantly. Teeth feel really clean and fresh.",4
2818,"From time I got it,  my kids have been attached to it but unfortunately it's broken and I need address were to return it or how to go about the return procedure",4
2819,Fully blackout and very large. Some of the suckers pull out and are hard top it back. Great for travel.,4
2820,Functions as expected for a quality product,4
2821,Gave it 4* just because the charge time is quiet long. Apart from that its ok.,4
2822,Gear product but some plungers are less effective than others,4
2823,Generally Gripping . Good holiday read,4
2824,"Generally speaking, I am impressed with this toothbrush, though some features seem superfluous. The device seems to work very well and there is a choice of brush heads to match brushing modes. It seems the CrossAction brush heads are the default option -- these have ""precisely angled bristles"" and are supposed to tackle plaque; they seem to work well. There are also heads and brushing modes for sensitive teeth, whitening, and gum care. This is a fairly powerful piece of kit and I've found the sensitive head and mode to be of use. A positive point is that replacement brush heads are quite reasonably priced compared with other manufacturers.The bluetooth technology communicates with a small LCD display screen, which tells you which brushing mode you are on (there is no display for this on the toothbrush; however, there are only 5 modes, so you will probably learn the order they come in and not need any indication after a couple of weeks of use). It also tells you for how long you've been brushing your teeth and gives you a star rating based on how long you brushed for. This is rather childish and not really necessary given that the toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds. The manufacturer promises a smartphone app that your toothbrush can communicate with; this is not something I would be interested in.Overall, this seems like an effective and versatile device, but I do not see any real appeal in the bluetooth function and display.",4
2825,"Given the high price you'd expect something that not only performs well but also looks and feels high quality, and for me it ticks these criteria. It's stylish, comfortable, and you can get a very close shave. Some people have commented on the ""plastic"" look but I find this a bit unfair, just because it's made from plastic doesn't mean it doesn't look good - it's a quality product, not a toy.Whether you prefer this kind of head to the Philips style is a matter of taste, and you'll probably have your own opinions on that. Personally, I find the Braun style a bit more awkward to work with than the Philips rotary heads, so I can't bring myself to give it five stars when I'd rather use my (cheaper) Philips one. (I've actually lent this one to my dad now who much prefers the Braun range and he is extremely pleased with it!)I can confirm that it does work with shaving gel, and it does work under running water - although I personally choose to shave in front of a mirror where I can see what I'm doing.As for accessories, there's a standard case and brush, nothing to get too excited about but they are present and correct, although I'm not quite sure what to do with the small bottle of oil, the instructions are somewhat lacking there. Perhaps I'm just being stupid. It's no reflection on the shaver though, which I'd recommend to anyone who preferences this style of electric shaver.Is it worth so much money? I would say perhaps not, but it's still a great shaver, one of the best I've ever used.",4
2826,"Gives a really thorough clean and an excellent choice of modes to really care for your teeth.  Choice of brushes maximises the usefulness of the product and there is a very neat travel case and informative instructions.  One thing I don't like about these toothbrushes is the need to charge them frequently, so the battery is really important to me. They advise 15 hours charge to give 2 weeks cleaning, and that seems to be approximately right. That's about acceptable though an extra week or two would be great. All round worth the money.",4
2827,"Glad I bought this in the pre black friday sale, got it for a good price.  My 5 year old daughter loves it.  bonus is that it can be used in child mode - suitable games and content - and adult mode as a kindle/tablet.  My only issue is that the battery life is not very good.  If you don't power it  down completely each time you've finished the battery runs out very quickly.",4
2828,Good and has made a huge difference - would love somehow for the suckers to be placed in different positions so you can alter it for different windows,4
2829,"Good and smooth shave, no irritation on the neck ( the Panasonic es-lv95 gave me some)trimmer is definitely no good, Panasonic is perfect in this, Panasonic might shaved me more close, less hairs missed.pros : smooth shave, faster than serie 7 799cc.cons: bigger cleaning station, the serie 7 was smaller and faster to clean, trimmer not efficient.",4
2830,Good arrived on time,4
2831,Good as ever,4
2832,Good battery and easy use. Timer is annoying though.,4
2833,Good bbook,4
2834,Good black out blind (best of its type on the market) but would be better if it came in even larger sizes and the plastic sucktion cups were improved,4
2835,Good book,4
2836,good book definitely recommend it. kept me guessing and entertained until the end,4
2837,Good book with twist which keeps you reading to the end. Would recommend for a holiday read as not too taxing,4
2838,Good brush at a good price with reduction and cash back. Must say a bit like a washing machine with all the different settings will probably only use two of them!,4
2839,Good brush with a whole host of useless extras; Pro 2000/2500/3000 are where the value is at.,4
2840,good but a little predictable,4
2841,good buy,4
2842,Good characterisation at the beginning of the book but it breaks down a lot as it progresses  to the conclusion,4
2843,"Good clean feel after use. I have not used with the mobile yet. Seems a faff to set up frankly. The two minute thing seems to take forever but it does mean ( at least I hope ) it means I clean my teeth properly. The case is useful. The different cleaning modes are very helpful. It is a good toothbrush and I am glad I purchased it. Sturdy, the small round head is great and much better than larger sizes. Charge seems to be lasting a good while.",4
2844,Good cleaning. Battery doesn't last as long as the Philips sonicare but apart from that it's pretty good,4
2845,Good fit in car does the job it was designed to well,4
2846,Good fit in the air vent as present. Prefer the cd gap holder if not using the cd,4
2847,good for kids.....BUT...if it breaks and you try and get a NO QUESTIONS replacement then it is a nightmare. I have been trying for weeks and keep being told this and that....but no replacement yet. Wondering if they just say this to get you to buy......irritating,4
2848,Good for the money I paid,4
2849,Good handy product! A little wobbly and can slant downwards. But apart from that great!,4
2850,Good holiday read,4
2851,Good holiday read with a twist in the tale !!,4
2852,good however takes a full 24 hours to charge up,4
2853,good item but has stopped recording wth poor internet connections.,4
2854,Good job for keep the lighting low. But suckers is very hard to put on and drop very often. Now I’m okay with it but Hope it not get worse by the time.- point is it’s make the window very hot when sun hit and smell plastic from suckers are strong. I always need to open window let fresh air coming in when my baby are not sleep in the room,4
2855,Good packaging. Blinds very heavy and bulky. Dirricult to actually put up.,4
2856,"Good performance but a bit tedious to put up as the Sucker fixings take some attatching, I just wedged it in the top of the window for quickness,",4
2857,Good plot and gripping tale,4
2858,Good price got it cor step daughters 21st app a bit tricky,4
2859,"Good Price, blocks out all light but doesn't stick on all surfaces. Once it's on, you don't want to peel it off cause it's another struggle to get it to stay. I purchased some velcro stickers to stick on to the wall and that didn't work too well either.",4
2860,good product,4
2861,"Good product , it properly darkened our bedroom however it was a little tricky to put in up ( suction keeps coming off) at first but then I tried the lick and stick, it works",4
2862,good product and fair price,4
2863,"Good product but as everyone else has reviewed, not that great at sticking to window. Does completely black out light. Like the fact they are removable and portable. Great that u can adjust size. Good product all round.",4
2864,"good product does black out the room. the suckers arent the best when you first get it, you have to press really hard to get it to stick but i used some polish on the window and eventually the did stick and has got better over time.it does stick to the window all night, hasnt fallen down yet after 2 weeks of using it.",4
2865,Good product even better at a good price.,4
2866,Good product for price,4
2867,Good product however comes loose from the vent every so often but just push it back being careful the vent doesnt get damaged,4
2868,Good product overall. Took it with me while visiting family (who don't have babies and think paper curtains are sufficient!)Fits well to lots of different shape windows. But found it did let light through at the edges especially were I had doubled at the velcro parts to make the gro blind smaller.4 star tho.! I'd rather be with it than without!,4
2869,Good product think but hard to get it to cover the whole window so it still let's in light so I'm going to buy some sticky felt pads to see if that helps but happy with the purhase and would recommend,4
2870,"Good product with usefull features.The battery could ve better, as it takes a long time to charge.",4
2871,"Good product, even though it wouldn’t fit on my toyota but will keep it for another car .",4
2872,Good product.,4
2873,Good product.  Little fiddly to adjust to window size but once its up the suction cups are excellent.,4
2874,Good product. Easy to use and effective,4
2875,"Good product. Lots to it, possibly more than you could ever want from a toothbrush.",4
2876,"Good productThis has everything I needed in an electric toothbrush after researching a whole month before buying.Feels premium and looks the part.5 modes, Battery LED, display, Bluetooth and a separate timer which connect to the toothbrush which I find very useful. It also has an app on the appstore (ios & Android) which is very useful to have to keep monitor of your brushing.What I loved the most about this toothbrush is the vibration which alerts you when pressing the head too hard on your teeth and also alerts you when it finishes that certain part of your mouth to move on to the other.You can buy different types of brush heads aslong as it is the Oral-B brand which can fit on the toothbrush which is useful as I use 2 different brush heads and 2 different modes within the 5 modes.The battery is disappointing which lasts me about 5 days of use, I brush daily 3 times a day, 4-5 minutes each time and charging is very slow. needs over 2 days of charge to get the battery full.This product comes with a case which fits the electric toothbrush securely and 2 other toothbrush heads.My teeth are now clean as a fairy!You need to buy shaver adaptor separately.",4
2877,Good pump but just wish I could express a bit  quicker. That could be down to my supply rather than the pump though. Also not sure if lansinoh sell different sized breast cushions like some other brands.,4
2878,"Good purchase, I bought in Black Friday sales so it was a bargain, I don't know if I would £200 though",4
2879,good quality,4
2880,Good quality :-),4
2881,Good quality and very proficient.,4
2882,Good quality cover but it needs some time to stick on the window. I was disappointed at the beginning then I like it as it blocks out the light in my baby's room.,4
2883,Good quality for your money,4
2884,Good quality phone holder with nice soft jaws. Would have to say that the part that sticks out on the nearest end of each jaw should be flat because they get in the way when you try take it out with one hand.,4
2885,Good quality pump which does the job well.,4
2886,"Good quality, cuts off all light. The suckers come off little too often, maybe softer rubber would help but generally very pleased.",4
2887,"Good quiet pumping action and I like the two phase pumping action. Seems to be as good as the other brand that we have used before, except this is a closed system which is very important. Also baba took to the teats on these bottles straight away which was a welcome surprise!",4
2888,Good read,4
2889,Good read and twists,4
2890,good read and with a twist or two,4
2891,Good read but spoilt by long drawn out ending after shock ending. Could have been concluded in. 1 more chapter.,4
2892,Good read couldn't put it down,4
2893,"Good read, felt the end was a tad rushed though.",4
2894,"Good read, with a view in the story from two different perspectives lol tsk of unexpected moments; a gripping read.",4
2895,"Good read,kept you turning the page to see what was going to happen next-sign of a good writer.The plot twisted and turned and I was not expecting the outcome as I'm sure most people wouldn't have either I was convinced Beth was the baddie and I couldn't have been more wrong.",4
2896,Good read.,4
2897,Good read. Compelling from the start and keeps you gripped throughout. If you like intense thrillers then give this a go.,4
2898,Good read. Didn't see that twist coming !,4
2899,Good reading,4
2900,"Good size , darkens the room and is portable.Lets in some light through the sides but darkens the room by estimated 95%",4
2901,Good size and does keep the light out well but we have struggled to get the suckers to reliably stick.,4
2902,"Good Spec tablets which have quite a good kids mode, however this tablet is still let down by the fact it doesn't come pre-loaded with the Google Play store (although easily side loaded). The main reason I have taken 1 star off is that you are not able to load any application you want into kids mode. For example you are NOT able to load Kids YouTube into Kids mode. Which for my 5 year old is a massive let down and for which at the moment he has to go back to his old Samsung tablet.This is really something that Amazon should allow you to do. It's your tablet....you should be able to dictate what you do or don't want your children using in Kids mode.",4
2903,Good story,4
2904,Good story and easy to get into from the start. Couple of great twists too.  Would recommend. Started by listening to the audio version but switched to reading and enjoyed it much better this way.,4
2905,Good story however very easy to lose interest in the first few chapters. To whoever wishes to read this I promise you it is gripping with so many twists and turns. It all makes sense just keep reading it and like me you will enjoy this read!,4
2906,Good story that kept me intrigued. Very intelligently told! The very last end was dragged out though but this is a minor.,4
2907,Good story with quite a few red herrings to lead you in the wrong direction plus a really good twist in the final chapter. Well written and all at good pace. A definite page turner.,4
2908,Good story with twists.,4
2909,"Good story. One of those where to begin with you can't quite figure where it's going, but it's interesting enough to keep you reading. The last chapter which ties up all the loose ends seems a bit unnecessary and American, but all in all thoroughly enjoyable.",4
2910,Good stuff,4
2911,"Good summer read, didn't expect the final twist",4
2912,"Good suspense and great twist. recommended reading, and one of the better recent books in this genre",4
2913,"Good thriller that has you guessing all the way.  I was constantly changing my mind about who was telling the truth and who was lying.  A really good suspenseful story that is about a couple (Kit and Laura) who, when at a festival for the upcoming eclipse, witness a brutal attack on a young woman.  From that moment on both of their lives are changed forever.The book jumps from both Kit and Laura's perspectives, which I thought added to the story telling in a really good way.  It also jumps from past to present which I personally also really liked and felt that it kept me reading wanting to know what happens next and how the past and present are connected.The only negative is that the book did flag slightly in the middle and I felt that the end was a little far fetched but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller and one that keeps you wondering...who is telling the truth?",4
2914,Good thriller with a difference. An interesting twist towards the end,4
2915,Good to use,4
2916,"Good toothbrush - comes with 4 heads which is good but didn't require the sensitive one. App is pointless. The bluetooth clock/timing indicator is kind of handy but could easily live without it. Don't think Bluetooth on a toothbrush is really necessary but hey, we're living in the future.",4
2917,Good toothbrush although the battery life leaves a little to be desired,4
2918,Good toothbrush but arrived in damaged unoriginal box which was disappointing as it was a birthday gift for my partner.,4
2919,Good toothbrush even though a bit gimmicky.,4
2920,"Good toothbrush for the price. think some of the features are a bit gimmicky, but overall it's a great brush.",4
2921,Good toothbrush mouth always feels clean after use.,4
2922,Good toothbrush. Phone app is a bit of a gimmick. Charging light blue really blue is really really really bright. Don't even consider charging in your bedroom as as sure will keep you up thinking the whole police force is outside !,4
2923,Good toothbrush. Switched to Braun from Philips following advice from dentist. The Bluetooth function is a bit of a gimmick and used it once. Would go for the basic version if buying again,4
2924,Good twist,4
2925,Good value for money and swift delivery,4
2926,"Good Value for money. Not as easy to set up as thought, not all suction pads worked on the first couple of occasions. The item is only suitable for temporary use.as stated by the manufactures instructions enclosed with the product i.e do not leave the blinds on windows in direct sunlight for prolonged periods of time. Happy with the product as only require for short term use.",4
2927,"Good, but cannot be used when connected to mains power supply.",4
2928,"Good, does the job but quite cumbersome for travel.",4
2929,Good😁😁😁😁,4
2930,goood,4
2931,"Got quite a few of these in our house at the moment. Recently moved into a new house and don't have curtains, these are a good substitute until we can get curtains sorted.One annoying thing is that sometimes the suckers don't stick first time to the window and fall off. Somehow my partner can get them to stay but I can't!!",4
2932,Got this for my granddaughters room. Fits lots of differant size windows. Works very well. Has suction  cups.,4
2933,Grandaughter loves it,4
2934,Great battery life and case. The fact you can have an adult and children profiles is great. Agree with a lot of the other reviews a music app is needed for kids. Also some intergration of the amazon prime video would be good as it limits what you can download quite a lot in terms of easy to access for the toddlers. (The only way to do it is to download BBC iplayer kids but to actually get onto downloaded programmes to watch offline my two and a half year old can't do herself.- no good when driving!!) overall great tablet for younger children who you want to restrict access too and gives them independence. :),4
2935,"Great black out blind. Only downside, curtain could do with slightly more material for the edges from the suction caps on glass  to window frame to totally cut out all day light. But they do the job well enough",4
2936,Great blackout blind but suction caps can be temperamental.,4
2937,"Great blackout blind!  Very handy that it fits different windows and a handy size for travelling.  The stuckers came off the window the odd time but it could have been that I hadn't put them on firmly enough.  Plus if one or two did come off, the others still held up.  Definitely worth buying.",4
2938,Great blind and easy to fix to window. Haven't used for baby yet so not sure if helps with sleep but good product.,4
2939,"Great blind but the suckers are dreadful, they either stick amazingly well or not at all!",4
2940,Great blind! Practical and easy to mount on to the window with the suction cups. Like the pattern too. Only reason I gave it four stars is because quite a few of the suction cups were misformed and needed to be put in hot water to make them work.,4
2941,"Great blinders. The only thing is that some auctions cups don’t stay on the window. It’s also frustrating to fully cover the window (such as the edges between the suction cups. So without added assistance from curtains, it doesn’t do a perfect job.",4
2942,Great book hard to put down.loved the twist at the end. Recommend it if you like thrillers. This is defo for you,4
2943,Great book with a good twist .x,4
2944,"Great book. Read in literally a day whilst on holiday, it's so gripping and has you turning from page to page desperate to know what happens next.For anyone who likes thrillers, I'm personally a fan of Tess gerritsen, Rachel abbot, a bit if poirot, Greg Iles and James Patterson to name a few, this book will definitely be right up your street.And as I got it for 99p on a daily deal, it's even more worth it!",4
2945,Great breast pump. Very easy to put together and use. Works much better than any other pump I have tried. Would definitely recommend this product.,4
2946,Great brush that cleans thoroughly.,4
2947,Great brush. Battery takes ages to charge and doesn't last too long tho,4
2948,Great brush. Really does the job. Only gripe is that it takes forever / 24hrs to charge,4
2949,Great but for my kids. My only disappointment is that you can’t add any BBC websites to the kids content.,4
2950,great Buy. Just took a long time to arrive. But overall I'm very happy with my purchase,4
2951,Great cleaning action.,4
2952,"Great deal , and awesome features, I only use this electric toothbrush now",4
2953,Great for 3 year old grandson,4
2954,"Great for a go anywhere blackout. Not too fiddly to put up, but is a little bulky in a smaller window area.",4
2955,Great for a portable blind. Obviously effectiveness dependant on the type of window you are attaching to.  Relatively compact for travel,4
2956,"great for blackout for a little one & the velcro & sucker combination works well to keep it tight to the window frameit is quite big and heavier than I expected so you need to plan how to put it up on smaller windows but it works a treat once you know what you need.not too easy to repack but gain once you get the hang of it, its good.The only down side has been it attracts and holds the heat in the room and a thermal one may be better as it would reflect the heat out.",4
2957,"Great for keeping the light away. The product is really good, but a bit hard to stick it on the window. If You dont do it properly, it keeps falling after a while.",4
2958,Great for shift worker. Only issue its a little small for my window. Otherwise it does what is says.,4
2959,"Great for supporting your phone, but it does fall out of the air vent on my car frequently. Think this is probably more due to the vent design on the car (Ford Focus).",4
2960,"Great for the summer months, it doesn't filter out all the light but is good enough. Would reccomend to anyone having problems putting lil ones down in the summer months",4
2961,Great for when I use my phone as a sat nav. It doesn't seem to fit perfectly on to my fan in my car though; having said that it hasn't fallen off (yet!),4
2962,Great has excellent battery life and good content for kids. My only critique is the restrictions in having to use Amazon's own app store instead of Google play store.,4
2963,Great idea and it basically works. Could be improved by addition of small velcro tabs for holding the blind neatly when folding to shorten it.,4
2964,Great improvement on the Colgate one I previously used. It came with three heads and I have only used two so far (not the angled bristles one). The timer is good but it continues after the 2mins rather than stopping which my Colgate did.Comes with a phone holder but I don't use this for brushing my teeth but a great addition to use in the office to have things playing on my phone whilst working :-PHaven't used the app as I don't see much point in it but my review does not reflect it as it would be unfair to do so.Carry case is decent with enough room to carry two heads (not main head and 2 spare).There's 5 settings but I only tend to use one (the most powerful) which is the tooth with the + icon. The battery defo doesn't last 2wks with this setting but can imagine it would with some less demanding setting.Overall happy with it and can recommend but the downsides are;- sprays toothpaste everywhere- doesn't turn itself off after two mins- battery doesn't last that long on most powerful settingOverall good toothbrush that I would recommend but maybe a little overpriced (£60-70 would be fair I think) if I have to be harsh.,4
2965,"Great item, holds my iPhone 7+ with a case.I have managed to knock one of the side covers off though but that could be due to my everyday use..4/5 just because of the cover coming off.",4
2966,"Great item, it really does black out properly. Velcro tabs to adjust the width and height of the blind. The suckers to hold it to the window are a little temperamental and I shall be ordering some velcro to fix it better when in use but overall very happy with it.",4
2967,Great little holder and would buy again but the rubber has broken off one of the 'legs' so it no longer stays in the vent. The legs tend to scratch the vents. Bit disappointed really.,4
2968,Great only downside is it doesn't tell you the mode setting it's on from the toothbrush itself only via the phone app.... which with five is a pain,4
2969,"Great package with everything that comes with the toothbrush.  My reason for 4 stars is because it needs charging constantly.  I used it twice a day, between 3.5 mins to 4 mins a day and the charge will only last for 4 days.  You probably need to keep it on charge continually.",4
2970,Great plot twist..although it does take quite some time to reveal itself!,4
2971,Great price and an excellent toothbrush.The gimmicky smiley face unit has really made an impact on how long I brush my teeth for and I am sure they are better for it.The only downside to this toothbrush is the stupidly long times it takes to charge.16 plus hours to charge a toothbrush is just plain stupid.,4
2972,"Great product although it is like a nagging reminder on my phone, but I need it, brief fresher, teeth whiter and dentist happier.",4
2973,Great product bought for a 3 yr old- could do with a friendlier operating system for kids but very impressed with the level of control to keep kids safe,4
2974,Great product but charge could be a bit longer but I’d say much better than the Phillips sonic range .This actually cleans you teeth very well and the indicator for pressing to hard is good too as is the timer.Charging with the blue light that lights up the room is a bit much but most people have a shaver socket in the bathroom which I need to install.Other than that solid product but one !,4
2975,Great product but I have an older style and find it far easier to adjust otherwise would be 5 star,4
2976,"Great product but I recivied a faulty one which has been sent back , seller didn't want to accept it back but had to in the end",4
2977,Great product but I still haven't figured out all of the extra settings are or what one of the gadgets does. My teeth feel great after brushing though.,4
2978,Great product but still a lot for a tooth brush,4
2979,"Great product for cutting out sunlight, especially as the days get longer. I love the fact it is easy to adjust the size & folds up small for use when travelling. The only issue we have found is that it tends to increase the temperature in the nursery when used during hot days, but nothing that can't be solved by opening a window.",4
2980,"Great product overall, and only negative is it isn’t quite as intuitive as the iPad.",4
2981,"Great product, well recommended and value for money thanks.",4
2982,Great product! Easy to use and set up. Excellent child controls. However... strongly advise parents to fit a plastic self adhesive screen protector... I accidentally dropped my daughters unit on the way to the car and the screen cracked... a tiny hairline crack...(Which should  be covered under warranty once I can send it back when we get back from an international trip)... because we didn't have a screen protector fitted the cracked glass is very sharp and we have to be extra careful until we send it back for a screen replacement.,4
2983,"Great product. It took longer than stated for despatch and delivery, but was well worth the wait.",4
2984,Great psychological thriller- fantastic characters and I really didn't see the end coming. One I've recommended to friends who enjoy the genre. Can't decide if I enjoyed all the information on eclipses or if I found it too much? Didn't detract from the story though- I fully enjoyed it and couldn't put it down,4
2985,"Great pump, very easy to use. The only issue I’ve had is that the writing on the buttons started to rub off on first use.",4
2986,Great read,4
2987,Great read I just could not stay away from itAllow yourself the time once started.Recommend to a wide readership,4
2988,Great read. Emotionally engages you.,4
2989,"Great shaver, it takes a while to learn how to use it. The only negative aspect is that sometimes the razor misses the very flat hair",4
2990,Great simple to use. Better on the new window we have as could open up over handles and frames. Came on time so happy with service. Getting a lay in now!,4
2991,"Great story, plenty of twists and turns",4
2992,"Great storyline and well written.  I must admit it got a bit laborious at times and I was willing it to 'liven' up.  But, overall a very clever, intriguing and twisting read.",4
2993,"Great tablet but it seems that when my boy has opened a lot of apps and goes back in to previously opened ones the sound goes off completely and I can only get it back on by going in to my profile and turning on a video with sound, then reloading his profile back up. Just a small glitch somewhere in the software i think. But apart form that if I have to use it I have had no issues.",4
2994,Great toothbrush - bluetooth is a bit pointless and adds nothing.,4
2995,Great toothbrush and timer. App isn't the best,4
2996,Great toothbrush but can only use the Bluetooth app with one phone :(,4
2997,Great toothbrush but have to charge every 3 days and it's only been used by me,4
2998,Great toothbrush you can see results in weeks!!!,4
2999,"Great toothbrush, all heads, timer and case came as described/pictured. The box was already open when I received the package, which makes me believe this isn't as the manufacturer intended (not sure it was meant to come with the different heads)I've been using this for over 6 months and works perfectly, the battery seems to be just as fine as it was when I first got it. The app that you can download is nice to use at first but after a while you'll forget about it! It is pricy but my dentist has commented on the improvement of my gums, which was the main reason I invested in the product in the first place.. so overall very happy.",4
3000,"Great toothbrush, charge time still ridiculous though. Loads of diff modes etc, my Mrs prefers sonicare. I feel, having used both the oral b and sonicare this feels like it is actually cleaning the teeth better. The sonicare just feels like it vibrates on the teeth. Only issue is still (this is my second oral b) the charge time is a joke. Maybe 12 hours to charge back to full. I can charge a laptop in 2 hours.",4
3001,"Great toothbrush, had similar a few years ago & when needed to was replaced with another Oral B electric brush which I've never been happy with. I prefer that this has a separate on/off switch to the clean mode operations/function as it makes it mucheasier to control. I also prefer that this shows the amount of battery charge as a permanent display so you know how much charge you have remaining. I like the deep clean function, it makes your teeth feel really clean. The Smart guide is a good feature, but I probably won't use the Bluetooth function. My old brush had Triumph written on the side & so does this one, for some unknown reason it doesn't mention this on any of the advertising/description of the product, I think it should because it would have made it so much easier in choosing the correct replacement when originally needed to do so. Would have saved me wasting money on a poor alternative. Also price was excellent in comparison to other retailers & on the high street.",4
3002,"Great toothbrush, my only criticism is it doesn't let you know when the charge is going to run out. It has 3 indicators for the level of battery but never goes down to 1, always run out of charge on the 2nd light.",4
3003,"Great toothbrush, quite powerful, good settings. Only minus is the battery life - we have it for a little over a week now and had to charge it 4 times already, whilst the product description claims 2 weeks battery life between charging. We’re only two of us, so would expect a better performance.",4
3004,"Great toothbrush, similar to the Triumph I had before with little change. Bluetooth is really rather pointless but I like the display clock. Stand is useless as you'll probably stick to one head at a time which happily stand on their own and case broke first time I used it.",4
3005,"Great, no issues with suction cups. It's not great if your window has a lot of panes, as there are not enough suction things, so cottage windows, unless you could fix the suction cups to the plastic surround. They should make one with smaller suction holders to do this. Overall for sash or upvc windows, it does a great job and it's huge!",4
3006,Gripping,4
3007,Gripping and tense in parts. Really enjoyed it,4
3008,Gripping book with a satisfying twist.,4
3009,Gripping great holiday read if a little unbelievable at times,4
3010,"Gripping plot that, for me, lost it's impact and interest towards the end.",4

3012,"had one of these for years, brilliant item does the job really well, wouldn't use any other. However, on my last two the battery charger died after 2 years. which seems to be consistent with several other reviews. They are about £20 on Amazon. Hence only 4 stars.",4
3013,"Had this a few weeks,nothing smart about.seems to be faster when cleaning and charge last a long time.good brush but if we need a app to brush our teeth then we're all numpties.",4
3014,"Had this not been reduced for Prime Day, I would not have bought it as I just needed an electric toothbrush. So, as an electric toothbrush, this is great and at the cheaper price with 4 brush heads, could not be happier. The bells and whistles, i.e. Bluetooth & Apps, work fine and would be just to thing to get kids to brush their teeth properly.",4
3015,Had to get this as my son constantly grabbed my phone for nursery rhymes but always managed to navigate to unsuitable videos. I think this is great for the parental controls and the ability  to restrict use.,4
3016,"Handy to have when travelling, and was a good option for us at a time when we weren't prepared to install a new blind or blackout curtain in baby's room. It is annoying to put up every night and take down every morning, though. Also has limited use if your baby - like mine - prefers to hang out in your room and in your bed from about 3 o'clock in the morning, and wake you up to watch the sun come up an hour later. I suppose you could buy two to remedy this situation, but then you'd have two sets of suction cups to put up and take down every day.",4
3017,"Happy with product, but could give you more choice for smaller windows. A bit too big.",4
3018,Happy with purchase,4
3019,"Happy with the time it took to arrive and the packaging. Happy with the produce itself, cleans my teeth so much better than a mual brush. My onl slight grievance is it seems to run out of battery quite quickly (2 days)",4
3020,Happy with this product. Very good value and well made. Bought it to hold my iPhone 5 when using it as a sat nav. It clips on firmly to the air vent at an ideal eye level. Adjustable for all different phones and different size vents.,4
3021,Hard to get up but stays pretty well once fitted. We will use it on holiday and overnights but I may put it back up in the nursery till I find a better solution.,4
3022,Has been very well used at home and on travels but always had a bit of a problem with the suckers not sticking. Size and blackout has been great. Very happy on the whole.,4
3023,"Has my 21 month old son sleeping from7-7 again after the summer morning started waking him at 5, occasionally one of the window sucker thing pops off the window in the night and he wakes early from the glare of light through the gap (this morning sunrise was about 4:20am I tell you) but most nights it stays put, it's a temporary solution until we are in our new house and can install blackout blinds. I think these adjustable blinds will be helpful to take on holiday etc as they change size with the help of Velcro patches. 2 extra hours sleep per morning, worth the £16.50 ; )",4
3024,"Have had several Oral-B tooth brushes the last being the Oral-B triumph 4000 but the battery lost power after 2 years.  So I was a little reticent about getting another Oral-B tooth brush but because this was on sale, I thought I would take the risk.  So far it has worked well.  It has more settings than the 4000 but I have found I only ever use the basic setting.I also don't see the phone connectivity and app to be anything other than a  gimmick but I have found the timer to be useful and having the smiling face and stars actually does make me brush better.  I got the Smart pack which comes with extra brushes, which will last quite a while.  It also comes with tooth past but it isn't very nice.My biggest issue with this toothbrush is the battery, which doesn't last too long before it needs recharging.  It also takes a long time to charge (around 36 hours to get a full charge which is a bit disappointing.I have said several negative about the toothbrush  but the main reason to get this toothbrush is because of its brushing quality.  which is extremely good, better than any other manufacturers toothbrush.",4
3025,"have have had electric toothbrushes before and saw this bargain.  Pretty please with the product.Now the kids don't have to share our ones.The only thing is the charging takes ages, if they can speed that up that would get a 5 star.",4
3026,"Have just finished reading this, I found it difficult to put down and the storyline really pulled me in.  Wasn't that keen on the various timelines and at times I did get confused and had to go back and check exactly what date the story was referring to.  I was also initially irritated by Laura's constant referral to her ""lie"" and the paranoia that surrounded it and the need to ensure that Kit wasn't aware of it.  However as the story unfolded it became clear how fundamental this issue of ""lies"" was to the story.  I must admit I didn't see the twist, and was shocked when it came - I thought I had it all sorted out quite clearly in my head how the story was going to pan out only for that to explode in my face, so well done to the author for that. Would recommend as a book that the reader will really have to concentrate on to understand the nuances of what is said and what is done by each of the characters.",4
3027,"Have only used these once but they were total blackout, so good to keep for travelling as some curtains in some hotels are very basic with much light getting through.",4
3028,"Have to agree the suckers could be a bit better considering the price, however a quick squirt of water to the window fixes this issue 90% of the time. In fact about to go purchase another for the other bedroom.",4
3029,Have used this on 2 different windows & they have fitted & stuck well. Black out the light very well. Would recommend.,4
3030,"Having been told about an issue right at the start, wasn't sure how the plot could progress.  Talk about building tension.... author did an excellent job building bit by bit with totally unexpected but realistic twists. Clever psychological thriller.",4
3031,"Having found the first 60 pages of this book a bit slow and repetitive, I was stuck to it for most of the rest. Although I'm getting a little jaded of domestic noir, the writing in this book is so great (i.e. the author expanded my vocabulary without ever making a song and dance of it) that I kept going after the slow start, and the rest is anything but slow. Very enjoyable thriller-type read. 4 stars",4
3032,"Having not used an electric toothbrush before I wasn't sure what to expect but I really like it and can really feel the difference in how much 'cleaner' my teeth feel.The toothbrush comes with everything you need (and more!).  It has a charger that you can keep the toothbrush on charging continuously (alternatively according to the instructions you can just charge the toothbrush every 10 days.  Since I don't have an electrical socket in the bathroom I have been charging it once a week overnight and this has been fine), a case for your spare toothbrush heads (it comes with 4 heads in total), and travel case and the Wireless SmartGuide.  It also has bluetooth which means it can connect to your smart phone.I admit I was less interested in the wireless smartguide and bluetooth - I just wanted an easy to use electric toothbrush and this one is really easy to use.  The smartguide is actually quite helpful letting you know that you have brushed your teeth for the recommended 2 minutes and concentrated on each quadrant equally, but I can't see me using the bluetooth.  It's good to have the option though.",4
3033,"Having owned the 7 series and the Panasonic 4 blade, I must admit this new 9 series has come some way.It's just a bit closer than the Panasonic shavers, which did a far better job overall than the Braun shavers.The cleaning unit is quite noisy, but no where as noisy as the Panasonic unit. Panasonic also do a terrible job of allowing customers to buy replacement foils, it's just not as easy to find as parts for Braun shavers in the UK.Like all shavers it lasts a week easily on a single charge.The unit itself doesn't seem to have any weak spots. The 7 series has a plastic release button which was easily broken.My problem with electric shavers are the running costs, the cleaning liquid and the foil. Those have to be replaced every so often.Overall it's not cheap to buy or run compared to the manual shavers, it's not as close shaver either. However it's a lot more convenient and softer on the skin.And this time Braun has caught up with Panasonic.",4
3034,"Having paid almost this price in the past for products which have to be recharged every 2 to 3 days all I wanted was a toothbrush which would last a week or more between charges. The write up said this was designed to go 10 days or more so I ordered one. I don't really know what to say about all the bits in the box but I did eventually find the toothbrush. I put everything back in the box apart from the toothbrush and charger and I am quite happy. It feels like quality, the charge lasts, it does a good clean. After all I just wanted a toothbrush. All the other bits are in the box in the cupboard and after the warranty expires I suspect they will go in the bin.",4
3035,"He Said / She Said is a twisty tale of deceit, lies and deception. Nothing is what it looks like and nobody is who you think they are. This is a brilliantly constructed and well executed plot. I found the beginning of the book a little bit slow going and even slightly confusing but soon found myself completely engrossed as Erin Kelly deftly builds up the tension and suspense.",4
3036,"He Said She Said is a difficult book to review without giving away too much. People who travel to watch an eclipse are willing to go anywhere and sometimes they end up camping out in a festival atmosphere. Sometimes they meet people who have lasting effect on their lives, for good or ill. Kit and Laura have lived in hiding from their 'stalker',  Beth for years. They met by chance and in an appalling situation where Beth was the victim of an attack. Their help has been rewarded by years of living in the shadow of Beth and now she's back in their lives. But who exactly is stalking whom and is anyone telling the whole truth? How good are we at convincing ourselves that we are honest? Or maybe, at least, we believe we only tell untruths that are justifiable? But sometimes even a lie of omission is as explosive as a vicious deliberate falsehood.This is a well plotted novel that kept me guessing and if you like a good psychological thriller you will love this.",4
3037,"He Said She Said is a story love, deceit and consequences.Cornwall 1999 is the first Eclipse Kit and new girlfriend Laura will experience together.  It was a disappointing eclipse and they were returning to their cabin when Laura finds a purse she follows the trail and what she sees is someone is such a state of shock she can't speak in a compromising position with a male. The male involved jumps up protesting it was mutual when Laura shouts to Kit to follow him while she calls police to report a rape.There is so much more to this book nothing is as it seems or is it?  There are twists and turns in this book that will have you doubting yourself.Very good read.",4
3038,"He Said She Said is a very clever name for this book as there's several ways it could be interpreted. It is told from his and hers POV but there are other undercurrent meanings that I can't mention in fear of spoilers. I loved how the title of each part of the book was connected to a stage of the total eclipse and the pictures of little Suns at the start of every chapter. I think the whole leitmotif of the total eclipse added a certain charm and set this book apart from so many others in the genre. It was interesting, well written, with plenty of twists but I'll remember it for the total eclipse theme.Many thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for the ARC.",4
3039,"He Said, She Said' by Erin Kelly will have you exploring the issues of trust and perspective like you never have before. Three characters come together, Kit, Laura and Beth, but who is telling the truth? What is the real story?1999, Cornwall, and Kit and Laura attend one of the many eclipses they spend their time chasing around the world. Kit is there first; Laura joins him later. They are young, they are carefree and they are having fun...until they meet Beth. The first time Laura catches sight of Beth she is lying face down in the dirt, her clothes pushed aside, the man on top caught in the middle of a rape. But is he? So the story truly begins as the story goes to court, and the secrets begins to unravel from their tightly wrapped and fiercely guarded roll of lies!So many different perspectives, so many different points of view to one story! Erin Kelly keeps her readers firmly where she wants them until she is ready for the big reveal, which I really didn't see coming!I thoroughly enjoyed 'He Said/She Said' and give it four stars.",4
3040,"He Said/She Said is a slow burner that gathers pace and takes you on a rollercoaster right to the very end. Twists, turns and secrets seem to come with every page turn keeping you hooked until the end.I enjoyed this book and read it over a couple of days. Thank you to NetGalley, Hodder and Stoughton and Erin Kelly for the chance to review.",4
3041,"Helped our daughter to stay asleep longer in Summer mornings, although it/suction cups do detach from the window occasionally. It definitely helps to darken a room, although ideally it should have another way of attaching, so you could move it aside during day, to let light in. Now it just stays on the window day and night with the suction cups, as I can't see anyone crazy enough to re-attach the curtain on a window every single night. But yeah, it does work, so four stars.",4
3042,Helps to ensure spending the correct time and not applying too much pressure.,4
3043,"Here we go again, was the first thing that sprung to mind with a supposed MSRP of over 250 quid and even well priced here on Amazon (at time of writing) at a staggering 180 quid, I'm reminded of a review I did a while back on a similar priced razor when I suggested that for that much money, it should shave me in bed, and then go and make the tea!You might ask what makes this razor so amazing? In truth, not that much.In fact the biggest plus I can see is that it DOES give you a close shave when using a shaving foam or gel, in preference to a quick ""dry"" scrape.I'm afraid I don't get dazzled by hype in the advertising like SyncroSonic Technology, well OK, sonic maybe -I've seen some evidence to suggest that sound waves help the hairs stand to attention for closer trimming, but when it shaves closer after a good coating of lather that doesn't follow either.I know I'm old school but it's about 2.85 for 5 Wilkinson sword blades (remember them) and they would last usually about a month shaving daily, longer if you were a cheapskate or had a light beard. So doing the maths, I make that 315 blades at one blade a week equals 6 years of shaving to buy this razor.Now before everyone starts moaning and checking the unhelpful box on this review, there's some good to be had.A lot of people (myself included) prefer foil style over the floating triple head Philips style when it comes to razors, as they seem to get in all the nooks and crannies easier.This is no exception, it's very very smooth, very easy to use, and very easy to clean under running water.Sonic Technology with 40,000 cross cutting actions powered by Sonic micro-vibrations to remove more hair than any other shaver, may be a bold claim, but it really is nice.For the more modern guy it's probably great, although I don't know how it performs on other areas of body hair. That generation is probably not as likely as I to go ""what the........how much?"".Enjoy a close shave, you paid for it. 4 stars",4
3044,"Hi, firstly I'm a big fan of iPads, and if Apple offered manageable profiles for kids on the iPad I would have gone for an iPad, but they don't so I bought this. It's pretty good, easy to set up, good size, appears to be good quality, daughter loves it, I like how I can manage her apps, although getting some of her favourite apps available to her is very painful.Things I don't like are1. no hdmi out or screen mirroring.2. Limited apps available and if you want a non amazon approved app it gets messy, I'm techy so was ok with this but others would struggle.3. Seems a bit clunky now and again with slowness and not responding, had to power off and on s couple of times now.Hope this review helps",4

3049,"How much technology does a brush need? This Oral B Smart Series recharchargeable toothbrush uses a Smartphone app to advise you on your brushing technique. I used mine with an iPhone 5c and had no issues with connectivity. You do need a bit of patience to set it up, it takes 24 hours to fully charge - so don't bin your old brush as soon as this arrives.It also has a set of different heads to use with the brush - these are not for family use but clean in different ways.If you haven't got a Smartphone to use with this, all is not lost, you can use this with the supplied timer - they even supply the batteries for this.The action is as with all the Oral B brushes, excellent - Oral B have been my favourite toothbrush brand, the small heads and innovative brush actions really do get your teeth as clean as they can possibly be.It's not possible to set individual profiles via the brush, but you can simply change the heads and use this excellent brush without all the Bluetooth bells and whistles to get your teeth wonderfully clean.The instruction booklet is clear and comprehensive and tells you all you need to know about setting this up and getting the maximum use out of the Smartphone app.If you have teenagers whose lives revolve around their smartphones this could be just the toothbrush that they need to encourage them to engage with twice daily dental hygiene. Gadget freaks should love it too. After the initial bust of novelty I'll  not be using mine with the app everyday - my life doesn't work that way - but I am really pleased with an excellent, stylish and very efficient toothbrush.",4
3050,I absolutely loved this book until about 80% through and then I felt like it lost it's way. Great plot but a disappointing ending.,4
3051,"I am a big fan of Erin Kelly. A few months ago I read The Burning Air and l found absolutely fantastic with twists (two of them!) that actually had me gasping out loud (so rare this happens that it's a joy when it does). It was for this reason that I was desperate to get my hands on her latest book, He Said / She Said. Maybe my expectations were too high this time around but it really didn't have the same wallop that the first book did.At the beginning of the book there is a letter from Kelly to her readers in which she explains that she is nervous about this book, not because of reviews and ratings etc. but because of the subject matter. He Said / She Said is about a suspected rape and the fallout from the night in question. This is not an easy topic to tackle and it raises as many questions as it answers. Kelly states that she went to watch several trials of this nature and that she was nearly swayed by a more polished and persuasive lawyer which raises its own questions. There were a few high profile cases that came to mind while reading this book, all of which have had massive media coverage and this was also tackled as a subject in the book: should the accused be allowed anonymity before being found innocent or guilty? I could go on and on about this because not only is it a really important subject that highlights the many issues of this sort of crime (not least the horrific ordeal the woman must go through again).Now to the book itself. Narrated by Laura and Kit in turn, girlfriend and boyfriend who have gone to watch the Eclipse of 1999 in Cornwall and stumble across what looks like a rape. In testifying about what she saw and feeling pressured and angry by the accused (Jamie's) Barrister, Laura tells a lie in court. This was totally believable. Who hasn't embellished a story to add more impact? Laura didn't pre-plan her response but it's a lie nonetheless and one that follows her for 16 years. The book centres around a few different themes and here lies my problem. The tale of the attack and the court case could have been a great, thought-provoking book on its own but instead it takes the route of stalker and psychopath as Beth, the victim, won't leave Laura and Kit alone. I understand that this was to be able to introduce twists and keep the reader guessing but for me it didn't quite work and I really felt that the main story would have been enough on its own.I found this a compelling and page-turning read but also a pretty uncomfortable one. The question around did Laura really see what she thought she saw was a great plot device but I never warmed to any of the characters in the book. Maybe that was intentional - not portraying Beth as the ""victim"" but someone who is pretty feisty and not always likable. I am curious to find out what others think about this book however so please do comment if you've read it.",4
3052,"I am a lifelong shaver with traditional safety razor, but I was offered this product for review so I thought I would try it.  This review is my honest opinion and I hope useful to anyone considering this shaver (whether an existing electric shaver user or not).First off, this feels like a real quality product in your hand.  The finish is lovely and it looks really stylish. There is a weight and solidity to it.  The controls are easy to use and understand.  A simple round button turns it on and off.  There is a sliding switch above the on/off that determines whether the head rotates freely (default use), or holds in one of 5 positions (e.g., for shaving top lip).  To move between positions, just pull the head to one side or the other and it clicks into the next position.  On the back of the shaver is a side-burn trimmer that slides up to use.  That's it.The shaver is charged via the supplied cable (although you need either a 2-pin shaver socker, or an adapter plug for UK 3-pin socket.  The connection to the shaver is a proprietary one (as opposed to, say, mini USB) so you must make sure you don't lose the cable.  It charges up in a few hours, and my initial use suggests that it holds the charge very well.  There is a display of 5 blue LED strips below the on/off button, which decrease as the charge runs down.  After several full uses, it was still at full 5 bars.There is a nice zip-up case provided, although this only holds the shaver not the cable.  But given how well it holds charge, you would not need the cable unless you were going away for weeks.According to the manual, you should expect to get around 6 months out of a head before changing it, which at Amazon prices means a running cost of around 6 quid a month.  This is a similar cost to buying replacement blades for a modern 5-blade safety razor.Now to how it performs.  This is the only model in Series 9 that is wet and dry, and can be used with soap or gel.  Unlike many of the other models in the series, it does not come with a little stand that automatically cleans the head.  Instead, you clean it simply by holding under water whilst running, then take it out and run for a little longer to spin out the water.  Then detach the foil assembly at the top of the head to allow all to dry.For reference, I have a dark and bristly beard growth, which shows a distinct ""5 o'clock shadow"" by evening. I have tried the shaver repeatedly, both on wet beard and dry.  My findings were:- it definitely works better on totally dry beard than wet (which is kind of a shame, given then wet use is its unique selling point!)- it works best on shorter growth.  If I have more than 24 hours growth it does not cut as well, and can have a tendency to ""pull"" hairs slightly painfully rather than cut them cleanly- the head gets distinctly warm after a minute or so of use, so definitely use the shaver on the most sensitive areas (e.g. neck) first, whilst still relatively cool- do not expect to get the kind of totally smooth-to-the-touch result that you will get from even a basic safety razor.  Although it looked OK in the mirror, a quick brush with fingertips reveals a distinct sand-paper finish.In conclusion, this is a cool piece of kit, reeking of quality, but I'm afraid it has not converted me.  I will probably only use it when I want to ""top up"" my shave quickly, e.g., if popping into the house before going back out to a social event and no time for full wet shave.  Others may find that, with a finer or blonder beard, they do not need the closeness of a safety razor.  In which case this is a very convenient and easy to use device.If you are new to electric shavers, the price tag of this particular model may be a lot to lash out on an untried product.  Maybe try to borrow a friend's or start with one of the cheaper models down the range to see if electric shaving agrees with you.  (For info, most guidance suggests that you need some time of regular use for your skin to get used to an electric shaver anyway).",4
3053,I am a shift worker and work quite a lot of nights. I live in rented accomodation and cant install a dedicated blackout blind so was looking for something portable and came across this after a friend reccomended it. Having previously been hangingn bed sheets in the window i have to say the degree of blackout this provides is excellent. The reason for 4* and not 5* is that the blind is size adjustable with velcro but where you adjust it the blind tends to hang away from the window and let some light in - not much (compared to a bedsheet) but enough to lose a star. Overall i am very pleased but feel i could have made my own versoin for much less money.,4
3054,"I am grateful to Netgalley for providing a free copy of this ebook for me to read but all opinions are my own.​I get excited when an author finds an original way to tell a story.  The various voices and shifting timeline od He Said/She Said certainly succeed in creating an original and exciting piece of storytelling.Although I wanted to romp through the pages on my Kindle as fast as I could I found that if I took the time to stop and reflect at the end of a chapter before rushing headlong into the next then all sorts of subtle nuances came to the fore which helped me to understand the characters better and see how they had developed and changed over the years.The idea of truth-telling and whose interpretation of events is more truthful is explored throughout the book.  Can it ever be better to lie in order to serve a greater truth or should the truth be sacrosanct and the consequences be dealt with later on?  How do we even know what the real truth is anyway?These questions are cleverly and subtly explored throughout the book.Everybody has a different version of the truth  Their own unique interpretation of events that lead to unimagined consequences.I have to admit the twist at the end caught me totally by surprise.  It was not what  I was expecting but once I had caught my breath and reflected on the journey taken by Laura, Kit and Beth it was the obvious outcome.All the strands of time and all the different perspectives wove together to make the perfect ending to this clever and unusual story that had me gripped from beginning to end.",4
3055,"I am only able to compare this brush to the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 which I found to be a step up from the manual variety of toothbrush.The most striking differences are the look and feel of the handle area (much more substancial, although not noticably heavier), obviously the blue-tooth activated clock/monitor and the multiple modes of operation were not available with the 1000.One of the things I've never liked about the 1000 is the vibration from the handle to the extent that I tend to wrap a flannel around it ti reduce it's effect. It is fair to say I am probably more sensitive than most when it comes to this so I was really pleased with the much lower vibrations I experienced from this brush in use. Indeed I could dispense with the cushioning of the extra cloth when using this. The battery life was significantly better (at least 30%)The different modes and brushes have their uses but most of the time I would opt for standard mode (I found the soft brush too soft).The big selling point of the brush is the one thing I was most sceptical about: Bluetooth monitoring. I was surprised at how useful this was. The brush still vibrates at the appropriate intervals to indicate change of 'brushing quadrant' so if you only had access to the brush (travelling say) it would still be fine. However I was surprised how useful having a timer countdown was. I found I was much better able to judge my effort on each sector and didn't lose track of where I was in the brushing process (which, I admit, has happened sometimes).However the wireless monitoring is available on the 5000 without the requirement for bluetooth and at a significantly lower price.This is a good brush but, I would almost certainly go for the 5000 on the basis of funtionality but the inability to replace the battery would seem to push anyone on a budget back toward the 1000 price point.",4
3056,"I am quite happy with the shaver. It is almost as good as a razor on most of my face, but there are parts which I can't shave well with it. This is on my neck  where my beard grows in a different direction than elsewhere. I have to use manual razor there.",4
3057,I am really pleased with my purchase ! Excellent choice!!!,4
3058,I am still only 2/3rds of the way through but I can't put it down... it's just starting to come together and I can't wait for the end although I am guessing all is not what it seems!,4
3059,"I bought the Lansinoh pump in replacement of my Tommy Tippee one which started to deteriorate rapidly and became almost useless. I was in two minds whether to purchase this one or the medulla but after much consideration bought this one.I'm very pleased with the pump so far and am really glad I didn't spend the extra money on the medulla. Its quite noisy (hence the 4/5 stars) but is easy to use and is also easy to sterilise and put back together again. I haven't tried it with batteries as I always plug it in but it's powerful enough and I can express quickly and efficiently.I only pump as and when needed because my daughter won't take a bottle so I can't comment on its performance over a prolonged period of time but when I do use it, it works well and I'm very satisfied with it.Thank you.",4
3060,"I bought this as a replacement for the Triumph I have been using for a couple of years, which no longer holds the charge for more than two days. It has the same functionality, so there was no great learning curve, and most of the time it's a simple of case of applying toothpaste and pressing the 'go' button, making sure the head of the toothbrush is in your mouth unless you want to redecorate your bathroom.The only down side is the same one that seems to plague all the Oral-B brushes....the length of time it takes to fully charge, which in my case is around 24 hours, compared to the relatively short usage time, 3-4 days. This obviously varies according to usage, but does seem rather inconvenient at times.Overall, a decent product, but with a short lifespan due to poor batteries, which, considering the cost of the product could be better.",4
3061,"I bought this at a competitive price to replace my old Oral B model on its last legs. Not sure that the BlueTooth connectivity and app are necessary. If you don't know how, when and how long to brush your teeth without an app to assist you are beyond help!",4
3062,"I bought this at a heavily discounted price and would probably have gone for a lower spec model if it wasn't such a bargain. Because in essence the mechanics of the brushhead are the same as most of the Oral B line as are the brushes themselves and this is the most important part of a toothbrush!So what you get for the extra buck is stuff which is fun at first but the novelty does wear thin quickly. The LCD monitor is genuinely useful (even as a little clock for the bathroom!) But the phone connectivity is less so. Don't get me wrong, it works well and there are tons of practical tips and guides for good oral/dental care, but I just want to go in the bathroom and brush my teeth quickly with as little fuss as possible.There are other settings which are meant to deep clean or polish but I don't think they do much different in reality. The different types of brushes are probably going to make a slight difference but the standard 'Cross Action' brush is superb and gets the job done admirably.I definitely recommend it if you can get it for a good price otherwise you might be better of with a lesser spec'd model.",4
3063,"I bought this blind as I moved recently and I'm still looking for the perfect curtains. I needed something on my windows as the sun woke me up way too early. This blind is great, blocks out the sun (not 100% of course) and can easily be put up and taken down. Great solution if you travel and want to take it with you.",4
3064,"I bought this book as it was #1 in the chart and all I can say is WOW! I absolutely loved it, full of twists and turns that I didn't see coming at all! Brilliant book that had me hooked from start to finish and has me wanting to go eclipse hunting at least once haha!",4
3065,"I bought this book on the strength of other reviews.Nice book that jumps in time to backwards and present. Nice read, a couple of nice twists.I found the leading lady in the book to be annoying.",4
3066,"I bought this for my toddler. I've read some reviews about it before buying it and, being a prime member, it was obvious I would get the most out of this tablet (read, if you're not a prime member, this review is not for you).The tablet has a nice display, i'd not a full HD one but with a 8"" screen, the DPI value you get with a 1200x800 screen is a lot higher than your TV at full HD, so it matters little for crispiness. It's quite reactive, to be fair I expected the tablet to be a bit slow at that price, but it's definitely well optimized. It's very well thought for toddlers / kids and it contains a tremendous amount of content (you have access to your amazon video / kindle library, + access to netflix if you have it, + access to loads of content via the 1 year Fire For Kids Unlimited, which is then a couple of quids a month and well worth it imo). I've read reviews that it was slow to charge. I'm astonished ? mine charge very quickly, the battery last a lot (the 12 hours announced is not a big flat lie, I've never done an endurance test but it's clear you don't need to charge it often - I've had tablet I had to charge every 4 hours when using them, it's not one of those) and, if you use the proper charger, it charges very well. A few hours and it's fully up. Charge it during the night and you're good to go.My only regret is that the home screen (the ""Hub"" for kids) doesn't allow them to get access to a serie of content. So if you have on your Home page a Cartoon having 24 episodes, only one episode will show on home screen. If they want all episodes, they need to go to Videos and look for it there. It's clearly inefficient.I'd recommend to any parents eye closed for little kids. Beware, it's running a bespoke android which is not compatible with playstore, so you only get the amazon apps. As far as I'm concerned it's good enough, but for older kids it might be a bit limited if they want to do more than web, videos, books and games (the game selection will be more limited than on Android or IOS for instance).",4
3067,I bought this for my two year olds room as now it's so light outside at night it keeps her awake - this is definitely a good temporary blackout blind but as other reviews have said it does fall down now and then.,4
3068,"I bought this on sale for around £66 just after Christmas. My older Oral-B electric brush had just started to pack in after many years service from one drop too many, fading battery life etc.I initial bought the 4000 model for around £44, but on arrival, saw it had no travel case. Since my old one was broken, and a new case would cost anywhere between £10 and £15, it made more sense to upgrade to this model as it was also on sale.I am extremely impressed with this toothbrush, but would have hesitation spending nearly £100 on it.* The battery life leaves a lot to be desired - I fully charged this to be complete on a Friday morning, and by the time I arrived home on Sunday afternoon, 5 brushes had dropped the charge display from full (3 bars) to 2 bars.* It seems to take forever to charge. Overnight is the way to go.* When charging, the lights blink to show the charge level moving up .This is a bright blue light, and I don't see any way of disabling it. When fully charged, there is a single repeating blink of the Bluetooth icon, again very bright. This is a real pain if, like me, you charge on your bedside locker.The brushing itself is great, good powerful brush, and I notice a difference in this and my previous brush - I had a clean done just before buying this, and no tartar build up yet, so it's doing a great job in that respect.Bluetooth connectivity is a bit gimmicky - it's fun to earn badges, though you will lose interest in a while. I used it in conjunction with the phone app maybe 3 times before moving on and just monitoring with the digital display.For £66, I cannot fault this as an electric brush, but I would think very hard about your requirements before handing over £100 for it.",4
3069,"I bought this product as a Christmas/birthday present for my husband and as yet he has had to get used to using it for  longer than a week to be able to give an accurate review, but so far so good! Has yet to get a handle on the Bluetooth technology but again, time will tell!!! Good price though and quite a step up in quality from the old Oral-B products",4
3070,"I bought this product to replace my old electric toothbrush that had given up after many years of service, like all electric toothbrushes I have owned it takes about 24 hours to charge but it is comfortable to use and the bar indicating the remaining power left is so much better than the old one. 3 bars is a full charge and at 2 bars you have about 6 cleaning sessions left. My only criticism is that it is too easy to alter the selected programme whilst cleaning your teeth by accidentally touching the the select button.",4
3071,"I bought this shaver a year ago and have used it regularly ever since. The good parts:• Quality feel• Nice case• Can use in the shower (nice if you're in a rush)• Adequate display• Does a decent trim• Battery lifeThe cons:• Replacement foils are expensive• My foil tore after a year...• The cut it gives is no different to a cheaper razorI've seen comments about why it can't be used on mains power... The reason is because it can be used in the shower so no doubt some idiot would plug it into the wall then jump in the shower. The ""quick charge"" works fine for this.The shaver is decent but it's just not worth the cost unfortunately - I don't really see what the extra cost has gone toward. Any series 9 shaver has the same cassette.",4
3072,"I bought this to replace a philips, when it was first deliverd i have to agree with some comments that the chrome finish is a bit cheap looking, brushed steel would have been better, my first shave was incredible so much better than the latest philips models. and i love the cleaning station. i would recommend this product.",4
3073,"I bought this to replace an Oral B Pro 4000 that was losing the ability to hold a charge after about 3 or 4 years and was needing charging every couple of days. Given you can't replace the rechargeable battery on Oral Bs (unless you're handy with a soldering iron), I'd be wary about spending too much money on them. I got the Pro 6000 on a 'lightning deal' so am happy with the price I paid. The RRP for this model is fairly ridiculous - it seems electric toothbrushes are items that are often sold at large discounts.Overall, I'm very happy with Oral B toothbrushes when it comes to brushing your teeth. Took a bit of getting used to at the start, but much better than a manual toothbrush. As many others have stated, the time needed to charge the battery and the not terribly impressive battery life is the drawback with the Oral B range.Compared to the Pro 4000, battery life is a bit better on the Pro 6000 - while Amazon states on this page a seven day battery life like the majority of the (mostly blue coloured) Oral B range from the Pro 5000 downwards, Oral B actually state 10 days for this model (and the others using the same bigger, white coloured body). The low level battery indictor is also much better - I found the 4000 would inevitably, and annoyingly, just stop and only then would the red low battery LED flash. The 6000 has a three stage battery level LED that lights up when the brush is turned on and stays lit briefly when it's turned off so you can easily monitor the charge level. That is very useful. The fact that the rest of the 6000 also lights up like a Christmas tree when turned on is somewhat less useful...The other thing that annoyed me with the 4000 was that the on/off button also cycled though the various cleaning modes so required several presses to turn off. The 6000 has an on/off button (in 'daily clean' mode) that stops with one press. A separate button cycles through the other modes (that I never use - I only ever used 'daily clean' mode on the 4000). I don't use the app, but the separate Wireless SmartGuide seems pretty useful as an extra incentive to brush properly, though I suspect it will be another feature that won't get used once the novelty wears off.However, the fairly annoying drawback compared to the 4000 is that the bigger, chunkier 6000 is more unwieldy to hold and use. And the large clear plastic window with all those pointless lights (apart from the battery level LED) is much more slippery than the blue rubber covering the whole of the front of the Pro 4000 (and other Oral Bs from the Pro 5000 downwards). Not good for a toothbrush that will get wet. I never even thought about ergonomics using the 4000 - it was easy and secure to hold at all times. The awkwardness of the 6000 was obvious from the first use.It's an excellent toothbrush, like the 4000, but I'm undecided whether the better battery functionality and on/off switch design makes up for the more unwieldy feel. Certainly, I think Oral B could have improved the ergonomics of this brush.PS What's with all the Vine Voice reviews for this and other electric toothbrushes!",4
3074,"I bought this to replace my trusty Braun 790cc, which was getting on a bit after 4 years of reliable use.First impressions - the shiny chrome-effect plastic looks and feels cheap. You tap the shiny plastic and it sounds a bit hollow, not good. That said, it feels weighty and well put together.Shaving performance is excellent. The head is larger than the 7 series, and feels a bit unwieldy when shaving narrow areas like the top lip, but generally works very well.What I like: great shaving performance, long battery life, fan-drying in the new cleaning unit.What I dislike: unlike on the 790, you can't see the battery and hygiene status when the shaver is off. There appears to be only one hygiene light that comes on after every other shave - that's not useful. Cheaper-feeling plastics. The cleaning cartridge now inserts into the back of the cleaning unit rather than into the front - which is a bit annoying, as you have pull the whole unit out to replace the cartridge.Overall, a good replacement and brilliant if you can get it on a lightning deal or similar, as I did. But the feel of the plastics, the niggles with no display when the shaver is off and the odd way of replacing the cleaning cartridge leave me slightly disappointed.",4
3075,"I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for my old Oral-B smart series 5000. I have been very pleased with the old one - had it for 5 problem-free years - and decided to replace it for the newer model. I am not a fun of Bluetooth but I quite like the separate timer-display. I gave 4 starts due to the missing small signal between each quarter of brushing time - the old toothbrush had it while the new one does not. I need to keep an eye on the display, which is not an issue while home. However, when travelling this is more of an issues. Perhaps I should connect it with my smartphone....One more info, although not a huge difference concerning the toothbrush itself, the display and charger are nicer & smaller.",4
3076,"I bought this toothbrush to replace an old oral b which was around 5 years old and the battery seemed to be giving up.After a lot of research I decided to buy the oral b 6000 as I didn't want to spend a lot of money but still wanted a half descent toothbrush. So far it seems to be good although I've not used the Bluetooth function yet. The only thing I have noticed is that it needs charged once every 7 days with 2 people using it. My last one, when new, lasted longer.",4
3077,"I bought this when the price dropped in a flash sale to less that what I'd have paid for the a lesser Oral-B model in the high street.  Loads of accessories, the wireless timer/clock/monitor seems like a gimmick but it's probably useful for encouraging good oral hygiene in young children, the same goes for the Bluetooth connectivity.  You can customise the toothbrush functionality somewhat by using the Oral-B mobile phone app to connect to the toothbrush and set it up, though you don't have to do so in order to just get on with using the toothbrush.",4
3078,I bought three of these to use temporarily in our new house while we order permanent blinds and so far so good. They fit all of the different sized windows I bought them for and really do black out the room. The suckers and velcro are a little fiddly at first but you get the hang of it. I will use them for travelling once we have blinds in our house.,4
3079,"I brought this back in August after having my dentist rip out a wisdom tooth and having some advice given, what can I say I have used a manual brush for years without any issues but having used this I can tell you it does a far better job than I ever did my teeth feel a lot smoother compared to after using a manual brush my only issue is there appears to be some issues with reliability.Up until last week the brush worked flawlessly before breaking randomly overnight it wouldn't turn on so I thought the battery was dead but after placing it on the charging pad it wouldn't charge and the bluetooth lights would just flash, I ended up having to get a replacement sent out to me and Amazon deserve a big thank you as after sending the first email to them with a video I had a response in 10mins with a message saying they had already dispatched me another, great customer service from Amazon.Other than my device going faulty I cannot recommend the device more, the only thing I would recommend is perhaps go for the none bluetooth version which is cheaper as I don't actually use it more than once or twice a month unless you can get this one for a good deal (I paid £79 for mine back in August).",4
3080,"I brought this for our summer holiday and found it very easy to use, particularly as it is adjustable and fits to any window.  We have since continued to use it at home during the lighter months.Its also nice to have the stars pattern, I would definitely recommend.",4
3081,"I chose the Oral-B 6000 as we already have two toothbrushes of the same make that have lasted for years and hardly need charging plus it got the best reviews for whitening teeth. Well it does the job, according to my wife, but she has to put it on charge for many hours at a time and three or four times a week. Our other ancient Orals last for weeks between charges - as only my wife uses the Oral-B 6000 I was expecting better battery longevity. The Bluetooth connected monitor is very useful for judging the quality of cleaning and is a neat little clock. We haven't tried the app for our smart phones.......OTT.",4
3082,I couldn't get I to the book at the start but glad I didn't give up. The story get a better and better. You would never guess the twist at the end,4
3083,I couldn't put the book down! Loved the way it flicked back and forth through time and the twist was unexpected and exciting to be caught up in! Would recommend,4
3084,"I decided to finally go electric to be able to shave every day whereas wet shaving takes time and leaves my skin sensitive. After a couple of weeks getting used to the new shaving technique I am very happy with the results and don't plan to go back to wet shaving.Some reviewers note the shaver heats up after a bit of use, I actually like the feeling though I guess some people's skin might be sensitive to that.The cleaning station seemed like it might just be an attempt to force consumables but I love the way it smells afterwards and presumably it will make the shaver last longer. So I won't begrudge eventually buying a refill, though I only do the full clean about once a week when recharging (manual clean running under the tap after every use).The charging station is quite big and my only shaving plug is on the light above my bathroom mirror, so I have an adapter eBoot UK Toothbrush Shaver Adaptor 2 Pin to 3 Pin and keep it on my bedside table.I also like the nice travel case it comes with.Bought for £149.99 (Prime day deal) but generally more expensive, plus the trimmer isn't good for sideburns, otherwise great shaver.",4
3085,I definitely recommend it. It is a bit expensive but it's really good,4
3086,"I didn't know quite what to make of this book initially. It seemed disjointed,with various story lines going on at once but I kept at it. After reading half way I became hooked. It's very clever (I think) much better  than The Girl On the Train.",4
3087,I do not use all the functions but I do like that I can track how I am brushing my teeth and tailoring my programme to my needs.Great value at the discounted price.,4
3088,"I don't know what I ever did without an electric toothbrush. Nothing, apart from a dental hygienist visit, compares with the just-brushed, super clean feel you get from using one. My brush of choice is a Sonicare one, from another manufacturer, so I was both pleased and intrigued to review this offering from Oral-B to see how it would compare.The Smart Series 6500 certainly is feature rich. It comes with 3 different brush heads, a travel case, a timer/clock, a charging station with a two pin plug (as used in most bathrooms) and the handle itself. The handle features bluetooth connectivity and successfully sends data to a smartphone app on which you can view your brushing habits and get some decent feedback on how you brush, how you should be brushing instead, how long you brushed for and whether you used too much force or not enough force. If you use too much the handle is clever enough to warn you via a light and to reduce the motion of the head to prevent any slight damage to your tooth enamel. In reality, this isn't too much of an issue unless you're the world's strongest person, but it's nice to know and have anyway.The brush has 6 modes of different intensity and length. Personally I like the whitening mode as it feels the most thorough. In all modes though the brush oscillates well and leaves you with the post-dentist feeling that is so nice and refreshing. Gaps between teeth and along the gumline are all properly reached and all in all it is an excellent clean. Compared to my Sonicare brush I would say that this offers equal levels of cleanliness and care, even though it operates in a different way.The travel case is handy and the various heads are all good and useful. Even the timer, which is of limited value I'd say overall, doubles up as a handy bathroom clock! All in all then this is an excellent brush as part of an excellent, premium package. There is just one, star-losing downside though...In use I've found a single charge of the battery lasts just under or exactly, a week. This compared to the 3 weeks or so for my Sonicare brush. I realise that if you use the charging base and store the brush in it, this might not be a massive issue. But, in the grand scheme of things a week's worth of juice is not that great compared to the competition. If they could nail the battery life, this would easily be a 5 star, quality, product. And, if you can live with a week between charges, hit the buy button. You won't regret it.",4
3089,"I don't know why but I wasn't expecting much from this book. Maybe it was the front cover ... I'm funny like that. But I have to say it's the first book in a long time that kept me guessing right till the end.First time reading author, won't be the last",4
3090,"I don’t envy anyone trying to make their mind up which ebrush to buy – even if you just look at Oral B there is a very large range of very similar brushes.  In truth they all do a perfectly good job in cleaning your teeth, so it comes down to how many speeds you want and do you really need a brushing guide and a connection to your phone.My Triumph 5000 Oral B brush has been on its last legs in terms of not holding its charge for a while now (I got about 3 years out of it) so I was pleased to given this very similar brush as a replacement, without the agony of deciding  which particular model.  In truth I tend to only use one speed, and I know how to hold the brush so as not to put too much pressure on.  I am also used to brushing in 30 second quadrants.However, none of that detracts from the fact that this is a very nice brush.  The add-ons would be great for someone starting out with an ebrush, and I know that the apps which track your brushing can have a positive re-enforcement.  I am not sure that I would pay the premium over the Pro6000, for what looks like one more cleaning mode and it being black, and you can get a dual handle pack in the Pro6000 for not much more than the Pro6500 on its own.All of this may sound a bit critical.  I don’t mean to be – just that with so much choice you have to work out what you really value.  Rest assured that all the Oral B brushes work well, and often main difference is in the head that you choose to use with it.  This comes with 4 heads to try out.  If this is the one you want then buy with confidence.",4
3091,I enjoyed the storyline and setting of eclipse addicts.  Very tense and I could not wait to find out how it would end.  It was surprising and unexpected.,4
3092,"I enjoyed this book but it wasn't a edge of your seat kind of book. It was however a good, twisty read and I would recommend it.",4
3093,"I enjoyed this book. It was extremely well-written and had a good easy flow to it. I've noticed that some of the reviews point out how much they hate the alternating POVs, but I can't say it bothered me. I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the whole 'alternating POV' anyway. I could take it or leave it tbh. In this particular book, it made sense and was interesting to hear the story from both sides.I've knocked one star off because I found it a little too slow in places and I kept wishing it would get to the important bits. But then, if every book only focused on the exciting bits and glossed over the rest, then it really wouldn't be worth reading.There are a lot of negative comments also about the eclipse chasing, but you can quite clearly see that the story required some sort of vehicle to move the characters around and if it wasn't eclipse chasing it would be something else, so why not? Besides, I got to learn a bit about eclipses at the same time.This book was a spur-of-the-moment purchase in my local supermarket and I'm pleased I paused long enough to read the blurb and pop it in the trolley.Can I just repeat once more how well-written this book was? Even if the plot was not your thing, you can't knock the writing style. Kelly has got that nailed down.I have no problem recommending this to anyone who likes a good mystery/thriller/whodunnit.",4
3094,"I expected better battery life, but without considering it it's a very good toothbrush.",4
3095,"I first read Erin Kelly when I read the Broadchurch novel and I was hooked on her writing style so when I saw He Said/She Said was due out I knew I had to get my hands on it. I actually read this book earlier in the year but due to ill health am only reviewing it now, and I can honestly say that this book has really stayed with me in the intervening months – always the sign of a great novel!He Said/She Said is a novel that hinges around Laura who witnesses a horrible attack during an eclipse, and her life is forever changed by that moment.I loved the way this novel was set during an eclipse because we’ve all heard about how behaviour can change as the sun disappears. It’s so peculiar to know it’s daytime and yet there is no sun, the air cools down as the darkness grows, and then just as quickly it’s all over and the sun is back. The way Erin Kelly chose to use this as the moment Laura witness the assault is just brilliant because Laura would already have felt unsettled by the eclipse and then to see what she did would have been horrifying to her. It works so well to see how darkness descends so shockingly both literally and metaphorically in this novel.He Said/She Said does move around in time – we get the build up to the assault and immediate aftermath in one strand and then in other chapters we’re in the present day and seeing the stress and anxiety that Laura and Kitt are living with. I thought the build up to the assault would be the part of the book that propelled it forward but I found that I was much more fascinated by how Laura dealt with it afterwards. She never feels safe, she seems quite paranoid but as you learn about what has happened you wonder if it’s that or if she really has reason to be frightened. I am always drawn to books that explore anxiety and trauma, having suffered from PTSD myself, and this book was so well done. I had to put it down a few times just to breathe because it really does show what it’s like when you’re reaching breaking point and you don’t know if you can trust your own reactions and perceptions anymore.This novel also looks at a person’s perception of an event and the way in which we can convince ourselves that something must be true. There is a moment in this book where a lie is told, the teller of which believes it’s a tiny little lie but the repercussions are huge. The tension really builds from this point onwards and this is where the novel really becomes near impossible to put down.This novel does have brilliant twists and turns, but it also has so much more than that. It’s a great exploration of how we deal with witnessing a traumatic event, and I loved it for that. He Said/She Said is a slow burn novel but it does continually build and build, and the tension really does reach edge-of-your-seat stuff! This is a novel that really gets under your skin and it’s one you won’t forget!",4
3096,I found the first part of the book a little tedious with too much time spent on the explanation of the eclipse (which was really nothing to do with the actual storyline) but once I had got through these it was as brilliant as her usual books.  I was shocked at the latter part of the book and really didn't see it coming - great book overall.,4
3097,I found this book a bit too slow at the start.  Too much jumping back and forth between people and years. The last few chapters were exciting and kept you wanting to read more until you get to the end.,4
3098,I found this book hard to get in to but then couldn't put it down. It would make a good film with all the twists and turns.,4
3099,I found this book hard to get into st first but was glad I stuck at it.  Lots of twists which kept you guessing to the end . Worth reading,4
3100,"I found this book to be a bit of a slow starter, but the time building up character descriptions and story lines was well spent in order to throw you off the scent and keep you guessing. It became a real page turner towards the end. I will happily recommend it to friends.",4
3101,"I found this one to be a bit of a slow burner and I almost gave up on it. I'm so glad that I didn't, as the storyline did get better and better and I found myself wanting to hurry through each chapter, to find out what would happen next. I do feel that the book could have lost quite a few pages, in that, there were several occasions where descriptiveness overtook the story and I could almost hear the faint strains of a monty python moment occurring, as in the ""get on with it"" caption. The author is talented enough to not need to be so descriptive and she needs to be confident that her story telling really is good enough without it. Having said that, I did find the information regarding eclipses very interesting but once would have sufficed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book and it's author to anyone.",4
3102,I found this story very hard going but one which I wanted to see through to the end. A good twist but took me a long time to complete. Certainly not a “couldn’t put down” type of book hence my 4 star rating.,4
3103,"I got sent a Braun Series 9 Wet & Dry 9040 razor to let my partner try for free from Braun as part of a campaign for Savvy Circle.My partner has been using the electric razor for a few days now.He has used a few electric razors in the past, but this one works very well.The Braun Series 9 is lighter than other electric shavers and has a beautiful modern sleek black design.The Braun Series 9 charges quickly. You only have to lewve the shaver on charge for 1 hour to get the initial charge and the charge holds well. The only problem is it comes with a 2 pin charger  and unless you have a shaving socket in your home you will need to buy a shaver adaptor for your plug socket.The Braun Series 9 gives a close, smooth shave on the wet option with shaving foam and is waterproof up to 5m. You will need to regularly clean the blades to stop clogging just like any other electric razor.The Braun Series 9 shaves well on dry shaves too, my partner still has smooth, silky results, but feels the wet shave gives better results as on dry shaves sometimes hairs are misses.The Braun Series 9 gives a close, comfortable shave on the face and neck, it's best to use the back trimmer to tackle sticking out nose hairs.So the 3 day beard theory works, and Syncro Sonic Technology gives a closer shave.The trimmer on the back is standard, trims well, but not good for precision shaving like styling a goatee.My partner found Braun Series 9 is quieter than other electric razors, but if you are an electric razor user you will know all electric razor give out some level of noise and are never silent.All in all, my partner loves this new product, although a bit pricey it does it's job, but I guess the more you pay the better the results.My partner rates this product 4/5 stars for efficiency, comfort and excellent results.",4
3104,I got this as a present and they love it.,4
3105,"I guess i am one of the many people out there who has tried there fair share of electric toothbrushes and done the inevitable dance of just grabbing a more convenient manual one when the battery dies, you run out of expensive heads or you travel and weight is an issue. So to get this delivered to my door i was pretty excited. This is by far and above the most advanced, and consequently expensive toothbrush i have ever owned or had the pleasure of using and let me start by saying - there is a difference!Firstly the toothbrush is fantastic at doing what it does, cleaning teeth. It is probably the cleanest my mouth has felt in a long time and such a difference when compared to a manual. The varying brush heads it comes equipped with are amazing and have actually whitened my teeth, something i thought would just be an unsubstantiated claim!It also comes with a handy travel case, stand and mini digitized computer gadget which connects to the toothbrushes bluetooth (yes, it actually has bluetooth.... a toothbrush). The battery holds quite well and i have to recharge normally about once every week, more if i want that super fast brushing feeling. However, the computer is quite difficult to set up, it has no buttons and it took me a fair amount of time to actually get it to connect with the toothbrush. Albeit i didn't read the manual, granted that was probably my fault but who really wants to spend hours pouring through a manual for a toothbrush?I really do enjoy the timer, it is a great little effect that pulsates when 30 seconds has gone by, this is an interesting little gimmick really, but genuinely has helped me to take better care of my teeth. The brush also has a pressure sensor, slowing the speed of brushing and lighting up red if you are brushing too hard.I genuinely do love this toothbrush, as a technology junkie, it has made a mundane task that much more appealing to me. Yet i feel obligated to give a 4 out of 5 simply because a part of me doesn't want to have a computer frowning at me if i brush to hard or for 1 minutes 50 seconds one day. Part of me just wants to brush my teeth, and in the end a lot of the technology, while helpful in some way, can seem a little meaningless. All of this and the fact that nobody really wants to pay in excess of a hundred pounds... for a toothbrush.",4
3106,"I had already enjoyed a braun toothbrush which was programmed to a clock.  I thought that was more beneficial to me than having it programmed to my phone.  In fact if I had noticed it on time, I would have changed my phone.  The toothbrush itself is better than my old toothbrush.",4
3107,"I had been looking forward to this top of the range series 9  Braun razor, when I opened the box I was suitably impressed! It's oozes style and quality, ok maybe not the first thing to worry about but this is a £330 electric razor so I don't expect it to look like it came from the local pound shop.It comes with a charge station that also steralises the head and lubricates it, after which it dries it too, this works well but it's not very quiet so not for very early morning use with kids in bed and upstairs bathrooms! The razor has a warning light to tell you it needs such cleaning, all very hi-tech but I will be happy enough washing it under the tap, and not have to change the cleaning cartridge every so oftenI am in my 60s so have mature whiskers that usually give electric razors a hernia, but not this one, a 3 day old load of stubble didn't even make it slow down, although it took me a few shaves to get used to the routine it requires, as there were some patches where it's awkward for razor to cut, even with the excellent adjustable angle head (which can be left floating or locked at an angle using slide switch on razor), but once I got the knack it gives as close a shave as possible for electric razor, very good indeed! First electric razor that does not make my neck line sore through pulling hairs, no soreness at all.Plus points, very well made and very nice to use once used to it, nice leather case, clever cleaning technologyNegative points, costs a lot of money, needs new head (around £40) every 3 years and cleaning cartridge every few weeks, the shaver body would be even nicer if made from chromed alloy rather than plasticIf I was buying one of these I would expect at least a couple of cleaning cartridges and a new head included in the price and that is why I gave it four instead of five",4
3108,"I had been used it for 3 month now and still work, is a bit slow now, but I think is because leatf it tonected all the time and also used it in the hight power, but still does it's work.",4
3109,"I had to buy something leading up to the summer - my three year old decided it's not bed time because it's still light outside.Thanks to Prime, I had this delivered the next day - result!I found it a bit awkward being the size it is, and trying to fold it in several placss to stick onto a smaller window, and the suction cups can be a pain when they fall off during the night... but overall, it does the intended job.",4
3110,I have always used Aral B tooth brushes this time I have upgraded and I am not disappointedGreat product,4
3111,"I have been a lifelong fan of the Sonicare toothbrush but I have to say that the Oral B 6500 series gives it a run for its money. I was impressed from when I opened the package to reveal 4 brush heads, carry case and wireless smart guide. The wireless guide was easy enough to set up and the Oral B app once installed is easy to use too. I initially thought it was a bit ridiculous to have a wireless toothbrush but I’m since converted! The brush has 6 different modes and each has an icon, so you can see which mode you are using on the wireless guide.I've been using the Oral B Black Pro 6500 Series for 2 weeks now and the difference is amazing. I didn't realise how often I pressed too hard on the tooth brush, but the clever sensor tells me. I use the deep clean option before going to  bed, which gives the 'just got back from the dentist' feeling. It is extremely easy to use and keep clean. The handy carry case has been useful when I have been travelling. The charge lasts for a week which is good.Overall I would give this a 4.5 out of 5. I marked it down a little as I think the tooth brushes should be a bit more distinctive to tell the difference and also wouldn’t mind it being a bit quieter as it is noisier than the Sonicare. I really loved the black design as it gave it a premium feel.",4
3112,I have been really pleased with this brush! At first I had thought the lights and wireless gadget were just a bit of a novelty however now I find them really useful. The settings options on the different kinds of brushing actually seem useful for once rather than just there for the sake of making it seem worth more. The way the brush lights up and pulses/vibrates to prompt when to brush different quadrants is great as is the red light and sad face when tempted to press a little too hard. The wireless screen with times and star ratings works really well with me as I like to know I have done a good job even when in a rush. I can see why some may find that a screen a little unnecessary or even patronising though. A full charge seems to last ages and it also charges back to full pretty quickly. My only real grumble is that it's a little noisy compared to my old brush.,4
3113,"I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for over 20 years. I change my toothbrush every 2-3 years depends on the battery condition. Since previous version Pro 5000, the charger can only be used in 220-240v countries, it gives me a headache when I travel to the countries like Japan, Taiwan and the US (110-120v). I hope the next model will come with a USB charger.",4
3114,"I have had a few electric razors over the years and have generally found them to be adequate for general use but rarely up to the standard and comfort of a traditional razor. Given the astonishing price tag on this one (my standard would be in the £30-40 range), I was curious to see how this could possibly justify it's RRP.I was dubious about the ""Syncro-Sonic"" abilities but this razor does appear to almost pulverise hairs, nearly powdering them! It offers by far the closest shave I've ever had from an electric shaver and it pivots smoothly around the contours of the face and neck. It is comfortable on the skin; I've had some serious irritation when using electrics in the past but nothing to complain about here. It's easy to charge and has a handy display so you can see how much life is left in the battery.If not for the price, I would give this five stars all the way. However, no matter how smooth a shave it gives, I just can't see the justification for paying nearly £300 for an electric razor, so I've deducted one star to reflect this.",4
3115,I have had Brown Oral-B before. However this one needs to be charged at least once a week which is a bit of a drawback. The clock is much smaller than with my old one which I got really used to.,4
3116,"I have had issues with it falling off the window. Other than that, blocks out the light. Recommend you get velcro stickers with these....",4
3117,"I have had this electric razor for about two months and overall I am pleased withe results though I do agree it is a little pricey  and the replacement foil head is certainly not cheap (though they do say it only needs changing every 18 months). To me a wet shave takes some beating, so with electric shaving I look more towards convenience and an acceptable end result. The Braun provides this, but it took me a week or two to get used to the foil, rather than the rotary heads of my Phillips.The cleaning station is effecient though once again the cost of replacement cartridges is a tad expensive. I usually clean the razor under running water for two or three shaves and then use the cleaning station after that. The instructions do tell you that the fluid in the cartridges loose their bacteria fighting quality after eight weeks, so being frugal in their use might not be so cost effective.The acid test is whether I would buy the same product again?  The answer is yes, it is a quality product and gives a good shaving experience. Would I buy it from Amazon? Once again the answer is yes. I purchased it at a good price, delivery was exceptionally quick and the product came totally factory sealed and in mint condition.",4
3118,"I have not been given a free sample and have bought this with my own hard earned cash for £134 when it was on discount (9040s).Also I have been very unimpressed by many of the reviewers who have received the item for free and decided to only use it once before passing judgement.Below is my review based on 30-days of use.Before you read my “thesis” below here’s a summary:- Expensive but latest wet and dry foil razor available.- Shaves close with some but not “none” irritation.- Works best as a daily shaver.- Adequate trimmer for side burns.- Battery life – 14 shaves at 3 – 5 min per shave (I Probably could have got a few more shaves out of it)- Semi-soft travel case – appears adequate and will protect shaver from all but the heaviest knocks.- Really annoying 2-pin plug which needs an adapter- Overall not as close as a multi-blade cartridge razor which is probably why it leads to fewer ingrown hairs than my Mach 3 or fusion.- Double Edge shaving is even better and in my opinion still the best shaving option for closeness and irritation free shaving with very few in-grown hairs but its more time consuming with all the prep and multi-passes.Overall:- I am very happy and would recommend to anyone wanting a fast yet acceptable shave with mild irritation and minimal ingrown hairs and irritation. For me this was a Damn Fine Shave (DFS) on cheeks and Socially Acceptable Shave (SAS) on the neck.- With more time spent shaving I can get a DFS on the neck as well but then the irritation is higher.Full Review (PhD Thesis!!)BackgroundSince I was young I have always hated shaving. I have thick, curly hair which means I suffer from ingrown hairs and shaving rash particularly on my neck. I had used various post-shave ointments which did help but I eventually gave up wet shaving all together and started either just using a beard trimmer or keeping designer stubble/beard.I eventually started wet shaving again when I discovered double edge (DE) razors and even after using the Braun series 9, I have to say that the most pleasurable experience shaving and the closest shave with no irritation was with a DE razor, good quality badger brush with high quality shave cream and post-shave balm. This ritual however was a bit too long even after I had got it down to around 10-15 minutes. I’m usually in a rush in the morning and can’t be bothered to shave at night. I eventually went back to keeping a beard. I then got a job interview for a promotion and decided I should start shaving again.That brings me onto the Braun series 9. Why this one in particular? I had previously tried a mid range Philips rotary and it left my neck feeling very raw and since then I haven’t been so keen on electrics, but I kept seeing various ones on offer and decided to give it another go. Also if I was going to do this I would pick what is arguably the best money can buy (without the cleaning station as I already have enough junk in my house).ReviewFor this review I tried it out on various scenarios and describe my experience of each one below. I always shaved before showering unless stated otherwise.Overall there is irritation with each shave but its not as bad as the irritation I get with a multi-blade razor. It also doesn't tend to get worse if I shave every day.  There are very few ingrown hairs. I did end up buying a few products such as a pre-shave and post-shave balm (with salicylic acid/witch hazel) to help with the post-shave irritation but these are not necessary. Let me me know if you would like to mention which products I used.Daily Shave: 1-day beard:This is where I believe this shaver excels. With 1-day worth of stubble the shave didn't take too much time, it was relatively close with minimal stray hairs, no touch up with a blade was needed and irritation was also minimal.Every 2 - 3 days:Shave takes a bit longer and leaves a few stray hairs on the neck. But as the stray hairs are now 2-3 days old they were more noticeable. Still acceptable but not as close or as quick as when daily shaving.Every 5 - 7 days:I trimmed first using the pop up trimmer and against the grain it did an acceptable job. I then shaved and as as before found the face was very good – DFS, but on the neck there were many stray hairs and I needed to touch up with a blade.I did try with a better beard trimmer as well a second time and the result was relatively similar.Wet:A wet shave in the shower not possible for me as I do not have a mirror in the shower and also I wear glasses and so did not try it out.Wet with foam:In my opinion this defeats the point of buying an electric razor but I gave it a go and although it felt very comfortable and the foil did glide over face/neck very well the resultant shave was similar to when dry. But still a nice experience if one wants to try it out.Post-shower with a 2-day beard:Foil did not glide as smoothly as before and led to a bit more irritation than usual. Probably because showering washes off any oil on the skin which helps the shaver glide. Shave was also not any closer.TechniqueMuch like wet shaving with a DE razor you will need time to adapt your technique to get the best shave. I had no issues on the cheeks but on the neck I found that having the skin a bit loose (like having a double chin) resulted in the best shave. This is a bit different to what others have recommended about stretching the skin on the neck. For me that just didn't work so well on the neck.  Also I had to remember to always go against the grain for the closest shave…which means up on the cheeks, across on the jaw-line and down on the neck. This will be different for each person so a little adaption will be needed.Other general advice regarding electric shaving is to persevere for a few weeks as it takes time for the skin to get used to a new shaving technique. I somewhat agree with this. I normally shower after I shave and although my technique had got better by the end of the review period and I was using a pre- and post – shave product, I did find that at the beginning the hot water from the shower felt uncomfortable on the neck and by the end of the review period it did not. Read into that what you will!OverallOnce I got the technique down and found some suitable products to use I was happy and can’t really imagine going back to wet shaving. Not because this is better, but because this is so much more convenient and quicker.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PS. Reading through a few of the other reviews it appears that some people don't seem to have read the instructions and think the slider alternates between wet and dry mode!!! All the slider does is lock the head. The wet dry logo is just that, a logo. Braun probably should have put it somewhere else to avoid confusion.",4
3119,"I have to be honest and say that I almost gave up on this book at the beginning. The detail dedicated to the intricacies of eclipses was a little too technical, in my opinion. However, I am really pleased that I persisted as the book did become unputdownable. A very good tale, well done.",4
3120,"I have used an electric toothbrush for many years, my last one was a Philips. this one is extremely hard in your mouth, and feels like you are cleaning your teeth with a mouthful of marbles, but is seems to do the job. The blue tooth thing is gimmicky but works ok",4
3121,"I have used Oral B products most of my adult life and this toothbrush is by far the best I have every used and my teeth seem to feel cleaner after every brush.  I really like the pressure sensor function as I tend to be a bit hard on my teeth and I absolutely love the display facial expressions.  I only found out that it winks too last night :-)  I really wish that this had been around when my Son was younger, it might have made teeth cleaning sessions so much easier.",4
3122,"I have used several Electric Toothbrushes in the last few years, and one thing that can be agreed is they do work much better than a manual one at getting your teeth clean.The Braun Oral-B PRO 6000 is the top of the range model and comes with the all singing and dancing gadgets, but are they useful and worth it? I would say no, not really.The brush itself is great to use and does the job. You have several settings which you can use such as Whitening Mode, Sensitive Mode, Deep Clean Mode, Gum Care and the one I tend to use most and that is Daily Clean. One of the gadgets with this toothbrush is a monitor which has a 2 minute timer (3 minutes for Deep Clean Mode) that tells you when to move onto the next segment of your teeth. There are visual indicators on the monitor as the time progresses. A nice little idea but is it something you need?This model has the added extra of being able to sync to an App on your Apple or Android Device. I actually laughed when I saw this feature as such a gimmick and not something people will actively use. I compare this function to the Siri function on an Apple iPhone. It is there but who actually uses it actively?! If you are like me and have a busy family life where you wake up in the morning and have to get yourself ready, children ready and dog walked all in a short space of time you are not going to care what an App is saying about your brushing habits!!!!!The toothbrush itself is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Does a great job at cleaning my teeth and you can feel it is doing it well. Also charge is good and am only charging it once a week. Oral B are experts in this area of creating the best electric toothbrushes, and as other brands compete it is now more about making their toothbrushes stand out with different features such as having an App as there is little ability to make the actual brushing better.My advice would be to certainly buy a Braun Oral-B Pro Electric Toothbrush but go for one of the cheaper models as the price you are paying for this model are for the gadgets and gimmicks which I don't feel offer value for money. Stick to the more basic model and you are paying for what is the most use, the toothbrush itself which is what does what it says on the tin and cleans your teeth!",4
3123,I haven't had this very long but it is an improvement over my previous electric toothbrush.,4
3124,"I haven't read anything previously by the author, but the synopsis of the story was intriguing so I decided to give this a go. It is written from different characters perspectives and jumps back/forward around 15 years between the different stages of the story. I liked this - its a nice way to keep the story evolving, and the twist/turns come thick and fast as the book progressed.I think its 4 stars as I think there were a few side stories that appeared later on that perhaps distracted from the key threads.But overall, I did enjoy this book. Gathered good pace as it went, and I would read more by the same author.",4
3125,"I judge all razors against my normal standard of wet shaving with a safety razor.This is one of the best electric razors I've come across.  It gives an even shave, without pulling, even when I've not shaved for a few days.I like the tilting head, which can also be fixed and all of the controls are conveniently placed.It's a bit on the large side for travelling purposes, but then the battery has a good long left",4
3126,"I like the brush as it makes my teeth feel very clean after use.. I know it is just a gimmick but I like updating the results on my phone for some reason it makes be brush for the whole 2mins. Battery life is pretty useless though. I found I have to recharge it after 5 days usage, which is 20 mins of brushing.",4
3127,I like the clean feeling this toothbrush gives me and the performance of this toothbrush is far superior than my old oral B toothbrushI like the colour of this toothbrush as well as the extra customisable light ring at he top of the toothbrush.The Oral B app that comes recommended is definitely worth the time getting used to as it shows information that you may sometimes missIt would be nice to be able to change brush type before switching on the toothbrush as you sometimes have to guess which brushing pattern you are using,4
3128,I like the toothbrush does really good job  I like the app to.It takes long time to charge and doesn't last even a week. Would prefer if it was USB chare.,4
3129,"I like this toothbrush it's easy to use and gives a great clean, does take a few days to full charge at times but leaving it over night isn't an issue. Glad I got it, a proper clean with this brush has given me whiter teeth that people notice  so happy all round",4
3130,"I listened to this on Whisper Link, as I now do on all my Amazon books, and the additional cost is worth it!.  Each time you start to listen to a new Audio you have to make friends with the narrator first or embrace she or him!  Unfortunately with Laura I found the narrator quite irritating. But once I had homed out of her annoying tone of voice I actually really enjoyed the book.  It is a slow starter BUT it is well worth the read and I didn't expect the twist in the end which was an enjoyable conclusion to the book!",4
3131,I love these earrings but they're smaller than i thought they'd be. I decided that i'd give them to my daughter for her birthday. I have bought from this site previously and would definitely recommend in fact i told all my friends at work before Xmas and quite a few bought Xmas presents. Would have given 5 stars had they been right for me,4
3132,I love this toothbrush. I use it twice a day and so does my wife and it never struggles to perform. A full charge lasts for days and it charges again over a day. I must of dropped mine 10 times and it's still perfect so they must be pretty strong. I would give 5 stars but the bluetooth doesn't want to connect but I guess that doesn't really matter.,4
3133,I loved parts of this book and grew bored with others. Worth a read but nothing amazing,4
3134,I loved this book and was completely drawn in to the characters. I enjoyed the frequent reflection on past events and everything came together in both a thrilling and tidy way. The only reason for the 4 star (not 5) review is because I found it a bit long. Stick with it though!,4
3135,"I made the mistake, at the start, of taking this book seriously.My advice is,  treat it as a 'beach' read and on that level, it's quite enjoyable.",4
3136,"I nearly gave up on this book in the slow first third of it, thinking that golden Erin Kelly had finally written a dud. But I'm very glad I persisted. Stick with it, it builds and builds and will stay with you long afterwards, as it will with me.",4

3139,"I previously used the black 600 as my main driver, which is a very good brush. This one is even better, more powerful, chunky, feels like value for money. The only reason it’s 4 and not 5, is that in order to know the brush mode, you have to use the extrenal display.",4
3140,"I purchased as a gift, on Black Friday excellent bargin. Good looking and sleek style, solid packaging and all bits in inside so no complaints.  Have been told it is good and teeth feel clean , not all programmes have been used yet. Will update when I have more information",4
3141,"I purchased this razor several months ago and have delayed writing a review because I wanted to give an honest opinion, based on experience.My observations are as follows. (1) It is very expensive and not worth the exorbitant retail price. (2) The replacement parts are also VERY expensive. (3) The cleaning station is a waste of time and daily cleaning keeps mine in  tip top condition. (4) The actual shave is pretty average when I compared it to my previous razor (Remington) (5) Unless you have more money than sense - don't buy.........Of course, you don't know all these things until it's too late....so....be warned. There must be less expensive and better shavers out there. Sadly, I will have to wait until I require another replacement.",4
3142,"I purchased this shaver to replace an ageing 7 series and I have to say it is very good.First the negative point....as other reviewers have mentioned, the mirror finish in gloss chrome looks pretty naff and actually makes the shaver look rather cheap. It marks with finger prints very easily but these can be rubbed off.It shaves very close although I have only used it as a dry shaver, and is so much quieter than my 7 series. The cleaning unit also appears to be quieter than the old version, and it cleans and dries much quicker too.Highly recommended....I would have given it 5 stars but that shiny finish is grim.....whoever designed this razor needs a serious talking to!",4
3143,"I read He Said/She Said from a recommendation in my Facebook book group Books, Glorious Books. This is a good, twisted thriller. The story starts off with a rape trial where Laura is a witness for Beth after witnessing an assault at an eclipse festival with boyfriend Kit. The lives of Laura, Beth and Kit are never the same and what ensues is a clever thriller. Kit is obsessed with eclipses and the book is broken into the different stages of an eclipse and is about the light and dark in everyone. This book is largely about secrets and how they can damage lives, I really enjoyed it.",4
3144,I read this over a few days and found it easy to follow. Not too many names to remember. Characters all believable.,4
3145,"I really enjoyed this - have read all of her others, Burning Air being my favourite followed by Poison Tree. Didn't like The Ties that Bind. Yes, there are some holes you could find in the plot but I liked the way it was written and found it very engaging and a good holiday read. The style reminds me a bit of Nicci French, one of my favourite authors.",4
3146,"I really enjoyed this book , my best read so far this year. Kept me guessing almost to the end, had a connection and sympathy with all the characters throughout. Very cleverly written. Would definitely recommend this as a great read.",4
3147,I really enjoyed this book after a slightly slow start where there were a lot of court room scenes.It was also interesting that it was set on the Haringey Ladder where I lived for 8 years and so the descriptions of the area were an added interest.The second half was well-paced and gripping and gave the story from both Kit’s and Laura’s different perspectives.  The ‘unreliable narrator’ aspect did remind me of Girl on a Train a bit.The twists and turns were clever and the ending explosive and satisfying -  if a bit unexpected.  The eclipse thread running throughout was a good framework for the story. All in all a great summer read.,4
3148,I really enjoyed this book as the story creeps up on you and then spirals on to a more dramatic pace where I found I could not stop reading as I wanted to know what would happen next. The ending did not disappoint either.,4
3149,"I really enjoyed this book, it's well written and I didn't work out the ending at all. Not gripping, but a great read nonetheless.",4
3150,"I really enjoyed this book, its a great page turner with a few twists along the way. Definitely worth a read.",4
3151,"I really enjoyed this. I thought the characters were brilliant with lots of interesting quirks, and the story was exciting with a good twist that I hadn't seen coming. At one point I settled down to read it for a bit, and the next time I looked up, four hours had gone by without me noticing...I love it when a book does that!",4
3152,"I really like it, it does what it says. My only problem is the size. I got big windows in my child's room and it won't cover them all... the same goes when we go on holiday.. it depends on the size of the window you find. It would be nice if for this price they would give you an extra bit to take or not take depending on where you go.",4
3153,I really like this electric toothbrush. It does clean your teeth perfectly and it makes a huge difference in comparison with a manual toothbrush.there are many options to choose and the product comes with a travel case and 4 different brushes that can be used with different purposes.,4
3154,I really loved this book. I did find the first half slow going but I wasn't prepared at all for the twist in the second half. A really great read. My only criticism was I really wanted to find out what was going to happen when Kit came over but the book ended before his visit!,4
3155,"I really rate the Braun brushes as the best I have used. After a brief flirt with a Philips one (very good in its own right) I decided to go back to Braun as I missed the choice of brush heads and their wide spread availability.I went for the Black Edition a few months ago for a change and because it was on offer but I had heard of a new model with Bluetooth coming out but wasn't available at the time.Now that it is out I was keen to try one with the app as I still rate Braun as the best electric toothbrushes I've sued to dat.The package though contains the brush, some heads including one of the new `cross action' and the smart guide. I'm glad they've included the smart guide as I find it quite handy now and its ideal if you can't make use of the Bluetooth function. There's also a handy travel case that should be standard really across all the top models (my black one didn't feature this).Charging is reasonably quick, though the initial one takes a good while as is to be expected.I prefer my black one now to the white ones and it's a shame they don't offer the top model in more colours.There are six cleaning modes so there is a setting to suit most I would imagine. I use it almost exclusively in daily clean mode which is just right for my needs. It has a red indicator for when you are brushing too hard and it will also stop pulsing to let you know. Build quality is fantastic and I prefer the larger size in use to the Philips I had.In terms of brush heads this pack doesn't include a tri-zone head which is my current favourite but a selection including the new cross action one. The cross action one is good and leaves my mouth feeling clean. There is a large variety of heads that can be had at reasonable prices compared to other brands which is a big bonus, not to mention easy availability on the high street.There is a brush timer for 2 minutes and it pulses every 30 seconds to prompt you to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. The smart guide unit provides a visual representation to prompt you also and also tells you what cleaning mode you are using. It awards stars for completing cleaning and to be honest I find it a lot more useful than I thought I would.I was previously unsure if I would make use of a smartphone app but it actually works well and I find it quite useful. Currently available on iOS and later android it worked fine with my iPhone. I tend to have my iPhone with me when I get up in the morning and get ready or when I lock up or night so it is little extra effort.Overall the Braun series of brushes continue to be my favourite. I really liked this one. It is well built and gives a cracking clean. Would like to see them also available in black (or indeed more colours) as standard.",4
3156,"I received this product from Braun as a Trial / Test Product.I purchased a Braun 3 Series shaver a couple of years ago and this was advertised as a wet/dry shaver but unfortunately I was never drawn away from razor shaving. When I got the email for a trial on this I was pretty excited to see what a more expensive and more modern technology shaver would provide.I was very impressed when I first opened the box; the design of the product is very beautiful it has a great light feeling in the hand and the black sleek modern design makes it look very classy.Like most shavers it uses a 2 pin charger, once plugged in it sits very nicely into its own cradle and took up little room on the shelf. I was shocked how fast it actually charges to full which was within an hour or 2 so I was able to use it pretty quickly. The display for the battery is a nice looking blue LED display which continues the modern feel to the shaver; however after 3 uses of the shaver you do need to charge it again so the battery seems small.The shave itself is not as close as I would have liked (compared to a razor shave), in fact if you try using the shaver after a few days growth you might be in for a long and irritating trip to the bathroom. I have researched quite a bit into dry shaving and there does seem to be lots of techniques to it which helps improve the shave so I have found this interesting to experiment with. I found it best if you shave every day as it deals with short stubble much easier.I mostly used it for dry shaving as trying to shave in the shower is difficult as you cannot see if you missed bits so not quite sure on the advantage of this. I found using gel a bit strange as I might as well have just reached for my razor, but the shaver handled this well and was able to shave with no irritation.The trimmer on the back works pretty well but again didn’t feel that it gave the close shave to give you the clean lines that you want to see. It works pretty well to trim a beard or a few days growth if you don’t want to shave fully. The shaver is extremely easy to clean and collects most of the hair when shaving which is brilliant if like me you normally create a hairy mess when razor shaving.Overall the Braun 9240 is a very good looking product but for me the overall price would be a turn off however for someone that is an avid dry shaver this is a step above the rest. Personally the time it takes and the quality of shave for me didn’t live up to expectations but I will continue with my different techniques but currently my razor rules the bathroom.",4
3157,I received this product through a product trial. I am impressed with the range of brushes available and the power but  note that 2 minutes is a surprisingly long time to brush your teeth so the bluetooth timer and application were a good way of managing this.  It's a bit cumbersome if you are travelling and doesn't have the sonic technology but I found my moth feeling cleaner and teeth were certainly whiter,4
3158,"I received this toothbrush free through SuperSavvyMe.  I've used electric toothbrushes before and was keen to see what this Oral-B brush had that would make it different.The brush comes with a visual timer and can be used in conjunction with an app (available on both apple and android) to record your brushing and highlight areas of possible concern.  You can also tailor a brushing programme, in conjunction with your dental professional, to get optimum results.  Who knew tooth brushing could get so high tech!First off, the brush does clean effectively.  There are 6 brushing ""programmes"" which allow you to tailor your brushing to your needs, whether that be whitening, tongue cleaning or sensitive.  I did notice the difference between the programmes although the differential between most was minimal.  You can change brush heads to suit the programme that you are using for optimal performance.Battery life is good - around 8 days so far although I'm not convinced that it took a full charge the first time I charged it.THINGS I LOVE:- The indicator that tells you you are brushing too hard - it's just a red light but it works!- The fact that the brush lets you know every time 30 seconds has passed.  Used in conjunction with the visual indicator (which splits the mouth into 4 sectors) this makes sure that you spend time in each part of your mouth.- all Oral-B brush heads seem to work with it - great variety depending on need.- The feel of my teeth after cleaning - they are so clean!THINGS I'M NOT SO KEEN ON- This is quite a heavy brush compared to many.  It's not too bad but perhaps not suitable for the very young or old.- The app - it's a bit buggy and for regular use a bit of a faff - I can see the point if you have a particular concern but I don't want to take my phone into the bathroom and when I don't link it I get reminders that I haven't cleaned my teeth (which is not the case!).  Although you can change heads on the brush so that more than one person can use the same handle, the app will only work for one profile.  This renders the app redundant if you want to share a handle.  Bit of a shortcoming here.Would I buy?  Yes, I probably would.  I do love the visual indication provided by the stand-alone indicator and think this would make it an excellent choice for slightly older kids who can be a bit slap-dash.  I'm not sure I'll get much use from the app - it needs to be improved really!If I could give 4.5 stars I would - it has to be 4 because I think that the app is an integral part of the USP and it's not that good - the bit that matters though, the brush, is great!",4
3159,"I recently bought this Series 9 Braun shaver in the Black Friday sale. I previously used the top-of the line Phillips Series 9000 (and another Braun before that).I was considering buying the Series 7, but since this one was one sale and the price difference was not much, I bought the Series 9. The Series 9 is advertised as the top of the line, and has ""40000"" microvibrations, whatever that means. Crucially however, this Series 9 only has 1 mode, while the cheaper Series 8 has several (including a sensitive mode). Worth considering if you have very sensitive skin. The shaver is also quite big and bulky, and the head quite large with 4 shaving elements. The Series 7 is a bit smaller with only 3 shaving elements (which is all you need from my previous experience with Braun). I thus doubt the shaver is worth the extra money over the Series 7. However, it is slightly better than the previous Phillips I owned (see below)Compared to the Phillips, this gets a closer shave and trims the difficult hairs more easily. However, I find that shaving takes me slightly longer, perhaps 3 instead of 2 minutes. Due to the Phillips head design, it never mattered how you held the shaver and in which direction you were shaving. With the Braun, you always need to shaving against the direction of the hairs. Now an issue, but something to get used to and probably one of the reasons it takes slightly longer.The charge and clean station is useful, but very bulky! I use mine every 3-4 days (as opposed to daily) and I have not yet had to clean it. Refills are not cheap, but apparently it is possible to clean and fill with a homemade cleaning solution.Worth noting that there are different models of the Series 9. I bought the 9095 which is a wet and dry shaver (ie can be used in the shower, there is a switch you need to flick for wet use). Other models are dry only. Despite being a wet and dry shaver, the 9095 is also not supposed to be used with shaving cream, there is yet another model for that! The product picture shows a 9 being displayed. This display (which is only on some of the Series 9 models) only comes on when the battery is getting low and displays the number of minutes left of shaving. I thought this was also used to display the shaving speed, but that's not the case as it is a one mode shaver only (see above). Also note that the wet shaver models of the Series 9 cannot be used while charging with a cable (security feature??), while the dry only models can be used while plugged in!In summary, very good shaver, but I don't understand how it can be single mode while the less expensive Series 7 has multiple modes. Also different models within the Series 9 are very confusing, so beware if you are looking for a wet shaver or want to use shaving cream.",4
3160,"I recently replaced my 10 year old sonicare with this. I have found my gums are a little sore after a few days use, seems like a tougher clean than the sonicare, will try the sensitive setting from now on. I use the toothbrush with my husband, different heads obviously! But the app only works with 1 user which is no good, so now it thinks i'm cleaning my teeth 4 times a day!All the different heads look good, only tried the cross action one so far. the little monitor is great because it means my daughter is encouraged to clean all sections of her mouth as shown if we brush at the same time (the timer only starts when my toothbrush is used).I keep mine on the charger in between brushes so i'm not concerned about how it keeps charge.All in all i'm very happy. Just wish the app would be altered to suit 2 users.",4
3161,"I replaced an ageing Remington for this Braun and it certainly gives a good clean shave. A major design fault is that the shaver does not come with a cover and so any minor trauma to the shaver head will damage the foils. Why does it not come with a detachable plastic cover?The trimmer is also on the small side and most sideburns are much wider than the trimmer. Thus it is quite difficult to cut in a straight line.Overall it is not worth the money, I would suggest buy a different make!!!!!!!",4
3162,"I seem to have taken a few weeks to get used to this shaver, to get the quickest best shave, but it does seem to be getting better giving a closer and quicker shave as trying out different techniques.  I've just tried the automatic cleaner device, and its very efficient, and results in a nice cleaner and lubricated shaver showing  a previous complainant about it burning his skin was due to pressing too hard with a dry unlubricated shaver. The only problem is that it seems slightly sticky after the lubricant, so that it doesn't shake the cut hairs clear as well as it did when dry.",4
3163,I spent a lot of time looking for a blackout blind as since daylight saving my little one had started to wake at 5.30am!!  I was concerned as there was a lot of conflicting reviews regarding the suckers sticking.  I must say that so far we have been lucky.  1 doenst stick the best but the others more than compensate so at the moment its not an issue.I do still need to pull down the blinds on top of it which helps to keep it up and also keep a bit more light out. As the other reviews state it doesnt sit flush to the sides of the window so light still comes in.But overall easy to put up and take down each night and it does the job,4
3164,"I spent hours combing the reviews for which tablet to by for my daughters 5th birthday.  She hadn't had much tablet experience so I wanted to get one that she could enjoy, but we could limit, and that was robust and worked well. I was a little worried about the negative ratings for this tablet. But after using it for over a month I can say it's been a hit.Pros:Spend some time working through the settings before you give it to your child. I did this over a few evenings and ensured it was completely secure.You can remove apps in the kids feature you don't want.  I took quite a few away that I didn't want my daughter using.You can limit time of use for weekends and week days.  You can also set educational learning time before they play.You can download apps from the amazon store and add them into your child's profile.  I've done this with a voice recorder so my child can learn her lines for the Christmas play.It takes an expandable sd card so it will be really hard to run out of room.The apps are age specific once set up and I've been suprised how many are actually education for learning phonics and maths.The range of books in the store is great.  They have all sorts of books and again you can remove ones you don't want.The videos play well and we've not seen any lag.  Again a good range.The case is really robust and hard to get on and off, even for an adult.The charge seems to last a reasonably long time.My daughter learnt how to use it really quickly without help.The screen quality is good and well protected in the case. I'm glad we went for the bigger size Kindle fire.Cons:The Amazon store is limited so if you have subscribed to anything else e.g.  Play movies or play music you can't get it.Amazon music can't be used in the kids profile, which us a real shame as my daughter loves music.There are no audio books included in the kindle, despite the company owning audible.  This us a shame for children under 6 who are not yet independently reading.The 4 stars are as a result of the cons.We've not yet taken this away on holiday so don't know how it will perform without wifi, but we predominantly bought it to be used in the house with wifi.We've had no problem with downloading or lagging. It's working well.I hope this review helps others who had the same dilemma as me choosing tablets!",4
3165,"I started shaving with an electric razor at 15 but, being a caveman when it comes to hairiness, switched to wet shaving at 18 and have sworn by a series of gillete blades since (most recently the Mach 3 Fusion) - nothing else has come close for me in terms of performance against my steel wool like facial hair.So, I tested out this electric razor with some trepidation. For me, it works well for a daily shave and can cope happily if I skip a day - in that regard it could replace my trust Mach 3. However, for more than two days growth I personally find that it struggles.Bottom-line is that this is a top notch electric razor - both in terms of performance and styling - and it could replace my wet shaves. However, after using it, I'm personally going to stick with high performance wet blades as I still find that they leave my skin feeling fresher and cleaner than the electric version - this may be as much to do with the ritual as any underlying performance, but that's my honest assessment.",4
3166,"I suppose I'm rather spoiled to have this as my first ever electric razor. It is remarkably easy to use, holds its charge for a long time, is simple to clean, comes with a travel case, fits comfortably in my hand without being too heavy or too light, and shaves as well as I expected it to (which is to say quite well, but not as good as using a traditional razor). I've used it both wet and dry and find that while it's nice to be able to shave in the shower, the wet feature doesn't work nearly as well as the dry--the shave isn't as close and it isn't as comfortable on the skin (it's not painful by any means, it's just not as smooth). I'm assuming this is because the head doesn't swivel when in wet mode.In all, I am very pleased with this shaver and plan to use it until it dies!",4
3167,"I suppose it isn't really fair only to give this techy toothbrush 4 stars - so far as the actual toothbrush itself is concerned, I would give it 5 stars without hesitation.  I have had several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years and they nearly all give an excellent result as regards cleaning your teeth.  This one is possibly the best I have had in terms of the speed of the motor and the brushing options available, which include:Daily clean mode;  Deep clean mode;  Sensitive mode;  Whitening mode;  Gum care mode, and, Tongue Cleaning mode.You can choose whether the timer is set to 2 minutes or 3 minutes.This set comes with:a travel case (very good),4 different heads: floss action, precision clean, standard, and sensitive clean (very good),a charging stand that is identical with all Oral-B brushes, a box with a clear lid that sits neatly around the charging base and has 4 compartments to hold the brush heads (very good).It also comes with a wall-mountable ""Smart Guide"".  This is in effect a digital clock that automatically picks up when you start the toothbrush and has a 'smiley face' which shows the timing of your cleaning in four sections around the face and syncs with the buzzer on the brush.There is a warning light - and the smiley face will change to a frown - for when you press too hard with the brush.So far so good, but then you get to the silly bits - unless you really like technical toys.  The Smart Guide will reward you with stars... and if that is not enough, the brush is Bluetooth and you can download an app to your phone which will chart your brushing progress and customize your toothbrush settings.  Personally I have better things to do with my time and think that for a toothbrush to be Bluetooth is going a bit far down the technical route - definitely into boys' toys territory.  However, if you like this sort of gadgetry, then it is undoubtedly the toothbrush for you - you can even synchronize two separate handles to one Smart Guide.  Otherwise go for a simpler option - and there are several to choose from.",4
3168,I think it’s worth the money my grandaughter never puts it down,4
3169,I think this is a great tablet but I think that the marketing is misleading regarding the kids element:- You can buy the non-kids version of this tablet for £79.99.- The only difference between the 2 is the case (£6.99) and a years subscription to Fire for Kids Unlimited (£3.99/mth or £1.99/mth for Prime Members).- So if you are a Prime member already it is better value to buy it all separately.- And if you don't want Fire for Kids Unlimited anyway then it's actually a rip-off because the kids software (which is what I bought it for and is very good mostly) come for free on the non-kids version of the tablet. To be fair to Amazon it does say this on the non-kids tablet spec. but they don't mention it on the kids version.I think the tablet is excellent value but you could save money and get a case with a stand by buying separately.Hope that helps,4
3170,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read, full of unexpected twists and turns and very well written. Hard to keep up in parts sue to jumping between dates but overall I loved it and had me hooked from first chapter",4
3171,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. Well written. Easy to read. Compelling. An excellent psychological tale with an original background setting. My book group read this and I promised I'd include their opinions so... EC said 'a book of suspense and desperation where the anticipation of what is about to happen builds and builds. . I thoroughly enjoyed becoming gripped with the twists and turns of the storyline and the tense nature of Kelly’s writing kept me hooked.I would recommend to others as a dark but exciting to read.' MC thought 'This was a very clever and original book however I did feel that it was quite slow to start. Once it did though, around the second half, it was difficult to put down. As the title suggests the story is told from both his and her viewpoints which, in my opinion, aid the story greatly. Just when you feel you are getting to know a character, it switches and makes you question what you’ve just read. You wonder who is telling the truth, it really keeps you guessing. The story led to an ending that I found utterly unexpected. All through I couldn’t quite see how their tale would conclude but I would never have guessed the direction it took. A brilliant ending. Also, this author so skilfully took you in one direction that when the twists and turns came in the second half they were astounding! I haven’t been as surprised by a twist in a book for a long time. It was great not to guess and to be totally blown away by the plot. Overall I would rate this book as 4.5 stars out of 5, it just misses full marks because of the slow start.' SF said 'Great book. I found it a little slow to begin with and took a while to get into.Once I got through the first few chapters it picked up. I loved the twist and was gripped.It is a fairly easy read. The language used was clear and convincing.' KS thought 'If you can handle the switching between characters and periods of time then this book has suspense and keeps you guessing whether all is as it seems.' DMcK said 'He Said, She Said is a brilliant read , where our main character not only witnesses a brutal attack but is subjected to a harrowing court case where psychological mind games are played out. I could not put it down. I would read more from this author. ' Finally MG told me to tell you' it was fab!' So there you have it, we loved it.",4
3172,I thought this was going to be complicated to set up but once I got going it was easy. The brush connects to the SmartGuide straight away and the android app was easily connected too. The guide displays which mode you're in and the timer starts automatically when you turn the brush on. We love knowing how much time is left. The app shows you news clips in case you're bored and tracks all your brushing activity . Even stores your dentist appointments. We haven't explored every part of the app yet but will do. My teenager is actually impressed and has started brushing is tongue. The black colour is unusual and classy. Different brush heads for different people and tasks are included. So far it's great.Just a slight annoyance when using the app - I chose the plaque cleaning journey and it locked out 4 of the 6 modes - it took me about 3 days to figure out why I couldn't use the other modes and only had tooth brush and tongue cleaning modes available. I really don't think the app should lock any modes out and that's the only reason I haven't given 5 stars.  As an electric toothbrush it does a great job - tongues too!.,4
3173,I took a while to get into the book.  I kept having to put it down and get back onto the story,4
3174,"I totally agree with the review of Fiction fan (Kirkintilloch, Scotland), so no more needs to be said, but I have given it more stars because I liked all the eclipse stuff.",4
3175,"I use these at home for all three of my young children in the summer months, and for my 8 month old's daytime naps. In the early days of the blind's lifespan the suckers are a bit temperamental but after a few goes you get the gist.",4
3176,"I use to have the oral B 5000. I went through two oral b 5000 as they both stopped working after travelling with them on aeroplanes. :-/So I decided to purchase the oral B 6000.I will not make the mistake of taking this one on an aeroplane.And here are my PROs and CONs from my experience of using this product.PROs- exceptional cleaning performance if used correctly, leaves your mouth feeling very clean- provides effective strong pressure even after using it for years.- smart sensor feature allows you to detect when you're applying too much pressure- timer allows you to ensure you brush for an adequate length of time. The timer has an attachment allowing it to be attached against a wall.- different brush head attachments available if you're fussy. I.e. The original round brush head, new angled cross-cross round brush head, soft brush head, rectangular conventional shape etc.- I had fixed dental braces and there are specific brush head attachments available for people with braces.- once fully charged, 2 people can use it twice a day for a whole week before it needs recharging again.- I've used sonicare diamond, the Colgate electric toothbrush. And by far oral B electric toothbrushes have been my favouriteCONs- lots of excessive unnecessary features/gimmicks that you're unlikely to use - like the Bluetooth phone app which I never use- didn't notice my teeth get any whiter after using it for several months. But it does leave your mouth exceptionally clean!- Twin plug in so you need to have a twin plug socket handyCONCLUSIONoverall a very good toothbrush just like any other Oral B electric toothbrush. Would highly recommend it but wouldn't advise travelling with it on aeroplanes.I've given it 3 stars due to the problems I had after travelling with it.CONsCONCLUSIONOverall I really like this toothbrush; its very effective and efficient at cleaning teeth and virtually removing all plaque.I would really like to take it with me when I travel abroad but after what happen to two of my oral B 5000s I don't want to risk breaking another toothbrush.",4
3177,I usually dislike time shifted narratives but this method serves this novel well. Strong characters established and an intriguing plot line.,4
3178,"I wanted to give this 5 stars, but it was so slow to start with, and wasn't drawing me in. I'm glad I persevered with it because it just got better and better. I bought by mistake the audible version, which also impacted on my 4 star rating. The voices were terribly irritating and felt older than the characters in the book. Will definitely try more of Erin's books.",4
3179,I was a bit put off by the banal chic-lit sounding title but actually this was a very good read. It kept me gripped right the way through and I was never sure how it was going to end. Enjoyable.,4
3180,"I was already using an Oral-B toothbrush before I was asked to try the Pro 6500.  Although I was impressed with what was in the box and I liked the choice of brush heads to suit the type of cleaning, my first impression was that the handle seemed larger and did not feel as comfortable in my hand as my current electric toothbrush whilst brushing, it also seemed a little louder.  It looked a bit daunting at first but thankfully the instructions were clear and I soon got the hang of it.  My teeth are feeling cleaner and with the help of the SmartGuide it's encouraging my children to brush for longer too as they watch the quadrant circle counting down the two minutes as we brush together. I didn't think I would use the Smart guide as much as I am, but I like to see the stars appear rewarding my brushing. The battery life is good, and if travelling it easily lasts a week and also has a handy travel case.  Despite my initial reservations I got used to the size and noise very quickly and I would recommend to anyone in the market for a new electric toothbrush.",4
3181,"I was given the opportunity to try out this new electric toothbrush for free as part of being a member of savvy circle.First impressions were good ,the electric toothbrush and accessories looked stylish and modern. It contained 4 different toothbrush heads, the smart clock,charging dock and storage for toothbrush heads and a travel case. The 1st charge took a good 24 hrs and has handy blue lights on the toothbrush to show the charging process. The toothbrush itself has 6 different cleaning modes and a built in timer to ensure you reach the recommended  2 minutes cleaning time and a light flashes if you brush too hard.I've owned 1 electric toothbrush before using this one again by oral b and I find the cleaning just as effective as this one but a lot cheaper. I only really use one of the cleaning modes anyway and the extras for me doesn't justify the price tag.",4
3182,"I was kindly provided a free review sample of this car phone mount to try out.I have been after a phone clip for a long time and this one is a very good one. It is very useful for having, for example, navigation on the screen and not having to constantly have to take your eyes off the road because it is being held right in front of you. It is a very handy thing to have in your car.The design is very simple but effective. It holds your phone very well and even when the car is bumpy it will not slip.",4
3183,"I was lucky enough to be sent this brush to trial and, as I had not tried a oral B brush before, I was keen to see how it would compare to the Philips Sonicare brush I currently use.This is a smart looking toothbrush and comes with lots of extras included.  The one I particularly like is the travel case, as I have not seen one before made for electric tooth brushes.This toothbrush comes with 4 different heads which I feel is great, as it gives you the chance to test them all to see which one suits you best.  One of the main features is that it is Bluetooth enabled which you can either link up to the mini timer that's included or download their app on your phone which gives you the option of following certain journeys to help you achieve the best results.I personally chose the whitening option which consists of fixed brushing times, recommended products & the best toothbrush head to use as well as various tips for optimal cleaning.  The whitening option can also be done over a 2 or 4 week period.Another of the little gadgets included with the toothbrush is that it indicates if you are applying too much pressure to your teeth, gums or tongue by flashing red lights on the toothbrush, as well as an alert on the phone app.The downsides to this toothbrush are:* Power runs down very quickly, perhaps due to the Bluetooth technology.* The button for changing the type of programme on the brush was in the way during use - I kept catching it with my hand and accidentally changing the setting.* The phone app keeps crashing mid-clean so it doesn't always log the correct information; sometimes it wont even load / open.However this brush does give a great clean and it is one I will happily keep using as well as recommend to others.",4
3184,"I was really sceptical about this but it has helped enormously. Admittedly we are using this underneath a blackout blind too but it really does help block out the gaps at the side as we have a sash window, so the blind never gets that close. For now, we have left it up so I can't confirm how brilliantly the suckers work if you keep taking it down. Very pleased we bought it though.",4
3185,"I was surprised how small they was, but very pretty",4
3186,"I was very pleased with my earrings, they look lovely on.",4
3187,"I would definatly recommend this book so well written and easy to get sucked into the story, my 1st time purchasing the audio book too made the story come alive and made it easy to multi task crocheting and listening to the book",4
3188,"I would have given this 5 stars had it not been for one very significant and annoying feature. I ordered this online and when it was delivered it already had my Christian name Simon entered into it....This is, by definition a kids tablet so why does it open at Simon's 'Fire'? Why doesn't it go straight to my daughter's set-up? My daughter turned on the Fire yesterday, entered the passcode and then, because she can't yet read, proceeded to make purchases of Kindle books etc. She didn't know what she was doing... This tablet should open at the child's page/pages and access to the purchaser's page should be deeper embedded and further protected by password. Amazon should not ship these tablets with credit card info stored on them nor should they be set-up so children can so easily make inadvertent purchases.Other than that..... a brilliant little tablet for children",4
3189,"I would love to have been sat round the table in Braun’s product development team when someone decided that the one thing the toothbrush-buying public really wanted, was bluetooth connectivity combined with a smartphone App… Seriously? Guys, it’s a toothbrush! Will this never end? Will we see internet-connected hairbrushes and nail clippers? What about bluetooth condoms to advise you of the speed, duration and quality of your sexual activities?Winding it back a bit and looking at the product itself, this is the top model in the Braun Oral-B Pro range, which is a chunky and comfortable device, which has various brushing modes, that either vary the brushing speed or change the frequency and duration of the brushing cycles. This model comes with a selection of heads from the Oral B range, as well as the little storage box/stand/charger to keep things tidy.This model includes the battery-powered SmartGuide separate display which provides added functionality of being a clock to have in your bathroom (which I find quite handy), but switches over to a countdown timer for each of the four quadrants of your mouth as soon as you start to use the device.If you happen to have a Bluetooth 4.0 compatible Android or iOS smartphone, you can install the free Oral-B app to mirror the display of the Smartguide display, as well as track the quality of your brushing over a period of time. It can also be customised to allow you be prompted to focus on particular parts of your mouth, or remind you to floss for example. It can be set to provide tips on oral hygiene, as well as provide a slideshow of soothing images for you to look at while you brush (yes… really!). If you normally carry your smartphone around with you first thing in the morning and last thing at night, then you might be able to get some benefit from the logging functionality, but to make your smartphone a visible centre of your brushing experience might just be a step too far to expect of people. For me, the best health and fitness logging devices are ones that just do their job without you noticing.At a price of £114.99 (at time of review - ‘cos let’s face it, the RRP is never used on Braun toothbrushes), this does feel like an awful lot to pay for some additional functionality that you may or may not feel is entirely worth the effort. The 4000 model comes with the same base, and stop short of including the SmartGuide, DeepClean mode (just a longer version of standard mode), and bluetooth, but currently retails at £54.99 (at time of review). You’d have to really want those extra features to justify that price.",4
3190,"I'd be giving this book five stars if it wasn't for the fact that the ending made me feel like kicking the wall. Others, with a different mindset from me,  will probably love it, but I felt that, while the twists in the plot were ingenious, some of the tricks played on the reader were a little cheap and the underlying misandry made me feel uncomfortable. However, that's just me, and there's doubting that Erin Kelly is a very accomplished writer, and this is definitely a page-turner.The best part of the book, however, isn't the suspense element, but the description of the solar eclipses and the way this is used as a central motif.",4
3191,"I'd not read any of this author's novels before but had heard her name. I found out later that a previous novel had been a Richard & Judy pick which is often a good indicator of an interesting author.The book is divided into  5 sections which imitate the 5 stages of an eclipse (eclipses turn out to be a main theme within the plot). There are 66 chapters and the story is narrated by Laura and Kit using a two time periods - the present day (2015) and the main story (starting in 1999 and working forward).There is a good structure but it is used flexibility to the benefit of the plot. Kit and Laura often alternate their narratives but sometimes the action stays for multiple chapters with one of the characters or in one time period. The narratives are mostly first person but the author diverts occasionally to give some facts or comments - this is unusual but feels very natural and allows the reader to trust the two main characters.I found that the first sections are worth reading slowly as I felt that the reader is being fed lots of clues, this had the effect of grabbing my attention and building a great atmosphere.The title of ""He said/she said"" initially seems to describe the subject of the trial but there is so much more to the story than that with Laura and Kit becoming embroiled in the secrets.I thought that the hooks and twists worked really well and actually gasped out loud several times.Particularly impressive is the research the author has done - you really can't take mobiles into the Old Bailey and there isn't anywhere to store them so local cafes/shops are the best option",4
3192,"I'll admit, when I first saw this I was dubious of the many zany features it includes. I mean, a toothbrush that can connect to the internet? ""Does it do the dishes too?"" my mum asked dryly when I told her about it, and we laughed.Well, who's laughing now, because this is the best toothbrush I've ever had the pleasure of using. I admit I don't know the name of my previous one - it was an Oral B rechargeable electric, after that there are so many models I have no clue which it is - but it lasted me 4 years and improved my dental hygeine in the most amazing way. I had always brushed twice a day and flossed, hardly ever indulging in sugary snacks or drinks, yet seemed doomed to cavities and fillings. Along came the Oral B and no fillings needed in over a year now. This one I'm expecting to carry on the legacy! It brushes even more vigorously than the last and I simply couldn't imagine not using it - I tried a manual one just for comparison and my teeth felt dirty! This is the Ferrari of tooth cleaning in both quality and price...and I'm aware that the price will make it out of reach for many of the buying public, which is the only reason it lost a star.It's very sleek and nice looking, all silvers and whites, and is a doddle to use. I have not connected it wirelessly via bluetooth and don't intend to - I bought it as a toothbrush and will review it as a toothbrush, not the smartphone with optional tooth cleaning feature it is trying to be. I really like the different heads it comes with; very handy for reaching those hard-to-find nooks and crannies in your teeth which are often the problem areas. It is powerful without making your gums hurt and does not take too long to recharge, which is amazing as every other rechargeable bathroom product I've ever owned has demanded a relaxation period of 24 hours in its little docking station before returning to work.I was so impressed with this that I impulsively bought one as a christmas gift for a friend - only to ring her up one day and find out that due to my overenthusiastic yacking about this toothbrush she had gone and got one of her own! D'oh! Well, at least me and my smile are a walking advert for it.",4
3193,"I'm a slave to the star system on the smart guide. If you brush your teeth for 2 and a half minutes you get 5 stars. Who cares about the judgement of a small plastic clock? Well it turns out I do, and my teeth are cleaner because of it.The battery gauge is rather annoying, as my battery goes flat somewhere between 2 bars and 1 bar, I'll be brushing my teeth, thinking ""oh, 2 bars, that's fine"" then it goes dead. The worst part about it? The smart guide doesn't know the battery is dead and gives me a paltry 3 stars, and a frowning face staring back at you, judging your oral hygene. That's no way to start a Monday.I am very happy with this product, primarily because it does a very good job of keeping my teeth clean. If the battery gauge worked it would definitely get 5 stars.",4
3194,"I'm not a big reader, just holidays and long journeys but I'm really enjoying this book. It's well written, it's easy to visualise the characters and I still haven't reached the twist!! A good holiday read",4
3195,"I've been using Oral-B toothbrushes for over 40 years and have been completely satisfied, as has my wife. My NHS dentist, periodontist, hygienist and implant surgeon all recommend them. I bought this one to replace our previous one that we had for about 10 years and was becoming very slow and a bit ineffective, so it was time for a new one. This is just as good, except for one small snag. Our previous one had a charger with an input voltage range of 100 to 240 volts, and we could use it in North America where they have 110 volts mains supply. The new one only accepts 220 to 240 volts. This is a problem for us as we often holiday across the Atlantic. However, fortunately the manufacturers have not changed the form of the handle where it fits the charger, and I have proved that the old charger works with the new handle. Problem solved, but it's a bit of a step backwards, don't you think? I have docked one star because of this.Update - I switched my wall socket transformer to 115 volts and the charger continued to charge. It looks like the information on voltage is purely a marketing issue, and the charger is manufactured for all supplies. Still only four stars, though, because of misinformation.",4
3196,"I've been using Philips rotary shavers since I was a teenager. My latest one, HQ8290 was due for an upgrade, so I decided to give all well regarded shavers a go. It's worth noting that I have a dry, sensitive skin so no burns is a priority for me. All three shavers I tested were a big upgrade on my existing razor and I am pretty sure most of you would be satisfied with either of them. Nonetheless, here is my personal ranking:1) Philips Series 9000Despite some design flaws (why is trimmer not built in?! why can't I press a button to lift the blades?! Why is display not fully digital?! All these are features of my 5+yrs old HQ8290...), I found this shaver quiet, efficient and gentle on my skin. Great upgrade, both in terms of blades and fully flexible head. Did the best job out of the three in shaving my neck and jaw line (independently verified by my girlfriend).2) Braun Series 9Very well designed (perhaps too shiny, but I can live with it) and, for a foil shaver, relatively quiet (that said, about 2-3x as noisy as Philips). It's the best out of the three for a very sensitive skin. I literally did not feel I shaved after using it. That said, whilst it shaves just as close/ closer than Philips on flat surfaces, it did struggle with my neck and jaw. Which meant I found myself having to run Philips afterwards to finish the job.3) Panasonic ES-LV65Don't get me wrong, it's a great shaver and the cheapest out of the three, but if you are to get a foil shaver, get Braun Series 9. I found Panasonic's big blade struggling at times, particularly under the nose and again, neck. I much preferred the feel of Braun. Also, the level of noise Panasonic generates is hardly bearable.",4
3197,"I've dabbled with electric shavers over the years but always returned to my 3 piece safety razor as they normally never came close. That is until now.The razor looks and feels like it's a good quality product. Comes with a travel case, brush and cleaning station which again seem to be of good quality.What I've found in the time that I've been using the razor is that in order to get the results you want you need to 'relearn' how to shave. If you try shave like you're using a blade this product simply does not give the results. However, I've found that rather than pulling the skin tight I get the best results by relaxing the skin even on the wire wool I call a beard. The only place I have a problem with the results is round the epiglottis and a couple of patches on the jaw line. It even copes with three days worth of growth and to date has yet to cause any skin irritation, which is something I do sometimes suffer with when using a blade but I do still use a post shave balm. The trimmer on the back of the unit is another matter. It simply doesn't work for me. I've tried holding it at different angles but it just can't cope with my hair. So far the batter life has been great and the bright blue lines give you a good idea of how much charge is left.The cleaning station is a great place to store your razor when not in use but I'm skeptical that the sensor is able to tell how dirty the razor is as I've had it do an extensive clean after just a few seconds use and a light clean after a full shave. Be warned that the cleaning station is bulky so make sure you have the room for it.Running costs are a little on the high side with the cost of the cleaning solution.Overall this is a great razor with a few flaws but then nothing is perfect.",4
3198,I've found my teeth to be much cleaner after using this toothbrush.I like the display that comes with it.Being Bluetooth I find the battery drains quicker than my previous Philips Sonic brush.It is loud and the vibrations are so strong it causes blurred vision when it use! I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend.,4
3199,"I've had a Braun Oral-B toothbrush for years, but it was looking a bit worn so it was great to be able to try out a full-featured model.  This toothbrush is slightly longer and chunkier than what I'm used to, but it comes with its own little travel box, which will come in useful.  The stand incorporates storage and the charging lead.  However, it takes an absolute age to charge and I can't really understand why when it still only lasts as long as my older toothbrush, despite only being used for four minutes a day.  There's not much warning - one second it's running, the next it conks out!  Another charging annoyance for me is the fact that the lead isn't long enough to reach my shaving socket, so I have started to charge the toothbrush using the unit from my old one.My teeth feel really clean after brushing with this toothbrush and the Smart Guide unit does help to motivate me to brush for the recommended two minutes.  I quite like getting the four stars and smiley face, so that's a gimmick that would definitely appeal to kids and aid them with establishing good brushing habits.  It's a shame that the Smart Guide has to be powered by a battery.  The toothbrush is rechargeable, so it would be better if the Smart Guide was too.  When the battery runs out I don't think I'll be that likely to replace it, although having the clock display is quite useful in the bathroom!The toothbrush ""talks"" to the Smart Guide via Bluetooth without the need for any user input but I've not tried it with the phone app because that's one gimmick too far for my liking.  This is a good toothbrush, it does its job well and the extra touches are nice.  Despite this I was shocked to discover the full retail price of this product and can't understand why anyone would pay so much money for what is, at the end of the day, still just a toothbrush!",4
3200,"I've had a couple of Oral-B brushes over the years & this performs as well as the other high end ones I've had. The batteries normally stop holding their charge after a few years use & I don't anticipate this one being any different. The Oral B app is actually quite good although I tend to rely on the LCD clock that comes with it, this also makes a very neat bathroom clock.If I had one minor criticism, the handle is bulkier than previous ones, hopefully this means the battery is bigger, it certainly seems to hold its charge longer however this means its a little bit of an awkward shape as it tapers from bottom to top it makes holding difficult when wet.One other annoyance, the charging LED flashes very brightly, I don't have a socket in the bathroom so this used to get charged in the bedroom not anymore though, this things lit up like Blackpool illuminations. Otherwise it would be a solid 5 stars.",4
3201,I've had an Oral-B tooth brush for several years now. This one is replacing my 5-6 year old model as it's battery was no longer holding a good charge.I would describe this an evolution of the previous one. Subtle improvements only really but I'm happy with the purchase. It works really nicely and the improvements are overall pretty good.,4
3202,"I've had many Braun electris toothbrushes before - not sure that the growing sophistication makes much difference to teeth cleaning but this one works well.  The timer unit (Bluetooth connected...) had a screen failure after a couple of weeks but amazon.co.uk was, as usual, great at replacing it quickly.  A worthwhile product.",4
3203,"I've never worked out how to use the countdown clock. Apart from that l have no complaints about this toothbrush. It lights up red when you have pressed down too hard, and glows green/ vibrates When the timer is up. l do find that If you go by the timer on the toothbrush you don't get a very good clean. But when I have finished My mouth feels so clean! If you are wondering why I've given this product 4/5 stars even though I'm sastisfied, it's because of It's asking price, I got this on a deal for £35, I wouldn't say is worth the asking price. You could find other toothbrushes on the Highstreet for cheaper, but would work just as well.",4
3204,"I've only used this for a few days but II'm fairly happy with it.  I read some of the negative reviews where people say it has damaged their vents but my experience so far is to simply be gentle about fitting and removing ad you will be fine.  I have used it on my newly bought E70 X5; there is nowhere to mount a holder without using the windscreen and I don't like to lose that visibility.Due to the size of our phones, S7 and S7 Edge which both fit with cases, it does cause some of the dashboard buttons to be blocked; this is not an issue of the holder but of the design of the car and the phone size.  It does mean that we have placed it on the passenger vent which points slightly away form the driver.  It would be nice to be able to angle it very slightly as the vent does not move but it works well enough.  The combined weight does make it a little difficult to move the vent up and down but again this is a compromise we made.The main thing I really would change is the closing mechanisim; it works but I prefer ones where they spring open with a button press.  Having to manually spread the arms puts extra stress on the vent and the holder that I prefer not to have.I'm pleased with this purchase based on the cost.  The only other option would have been a self-adhesive disc on the dashboard which would not be so great.",4
3205,"I’ve been using the toothbrush for about 10 days now and I can truly say this is a great product! It did take me a while to read through all the different settings and set it up but after that it is really easy to use. Unlike any other toothbrush I’ve used this before this comes with 6 different setting which is really impressive. It’s not as lightweight as my previous toothbrush but it is defiantly much better to clean my teeth with and is defiantly more smart and stylish! It is so easy to use and the Bluetooth times is great as you can customise it to your needs. My favourite functions are the whitening and the deep clean and my teeth feel cleaner, whiter and have had less plaque build up since using this. Even though it says the battery lasts 10 days I found it lasted approx 7 however this is still more than my current electric toothbrush! It is a little noisy however this is a great product which I will be recommending to my friends and family. The only disappointment was that I had to wait a day to use it as it didn’t come fully charged!",4
3206,"I’ve been using this for around a month now, I like it however I find the automatic pressure setting abit annoying! It turns off if you’re brushing too hard and I guess I brush too hard a lot 🙈 the app is easy to use and I like that you can personalise it!",4
3207,ideal for my car,4
3208,"If you like an easy-read page-turner this is fine, but certainly not as good as suggested by the newspaper review I read. It's probably more appealing to a young readership. I followed it to the end and found it rewarding enough, though it can't be called a literary book. Very much in the same vein as the majority of ""twisty"" psychological sagas out there. Having said that, if it was that easy to write one of these I suppose we would all be doing it. Oh, maybe we are!",4
3209,"If you like soft thrillers this is for you.Not exactly a heart racer but good story, good characters although some of the side characters could have been more detàiled as they seemed interesting - maybe they feature in other stories by the author. Would read more of this author.",4
3210,"Impressive gadget. The modes are really interesting. The timer is very useful. I haven't tried the app yet (and i do not think i ll do).But the noise....oh my god, it is really annoying!!! For this price (note: DO NOT BUY THIS IN FULL PRICE, it always comes in discounts in amazon deals & prime days & black fridays) i would expect better isolation of the noise.",4
3211,"In the box is an electric razor, multi language instructions, storage box, small cleaning brush, small bottle (5-10ml? ) of appliance oil, and a two pin charging cable which fits a shaving socket or requires an adapter . Its designed for a dry shave or wet with foam or gel.The instructions have labelled diagrams, cover several models and rather confusingly show many features that the shaver does not have! A bit of a surprise that it does not have all the bells and whistles, as its currently priced in the premium market.  A full charge took about an hour, the manufacturers claim 50mins shaving time from full charge. The handle has light bars and this indicates the level of battery charge.The shaver is quite large and the head has two foil blades, and two inner blades listed by Braun as a `hyper lift and cut trimmer' and a `direct and cut trimmer'. The is no explanation of the function of these blades.The head is 'locked' or 'floating' set with a switch on the handle. By the switch is a label/wet and dry which my tester interpreted as the position the switch should be in for a dry shave and or wet shave. But as another reviewer has pointed out this is not in the instructions so is probably a brand mark.  The shaver can be locked to remove the risk of accidental turning on by pressing and holding the on/off button for 3 seconds.On the reverse of the shaver is an additional blade to trim long hair such as side burns.  The blade is unlocked and can be moved up inline with the shaver foils. The blade looks like a fine toothed comb and when turned on a fine blade moves across the bottom.`Mr SV' tested the product. He generally prefers a close shave which he achieves with a wet razor. He's never found an electric shaver which he finds gives a comparable finish.  His verdict was that dry it was a typical electric shaver finish, but wet was much improved, probably 95% as good as a manual wet shave. He said his skin is fairly smooth, but for any one with lumps, bumps or scars where a manual wet shave could leave to cuts this shaver would be preferable.",4
3212,"In this psychological thriller that has plenty of twists and turns, which you can not predict. I do feel the suspense was reduced by the build up pace being a little to slow in parts.That said anyone looking for a holiday read, I do recommend this book as one to take.Thank you netgalley, Erin Kelly & Hodder & Stoughton for allowing me to review this book.",4
3213,Incredible piece of technology! I've had many electric toothbrushes in the past but never before have my teeth and gums felt like this.The smartphone app is great and I love the different 'journeys' you can programme into the toothbrush (teeth whitening or plaque fighter)The only thing preventing a five star review is that it takes a long time to fully charge. But then again that's electric toothbrushes in General.Love this toothbrush.,4
3214,Initially thought this was going to be a story about a slightly unhinged stalker but it became much more.Wasn't so keen on the whole eclipse theme but a good read and good twist.,4
3215,Interesting book but not as thrilling as it was made out to be,4
3216,Interesting premise and a good read.  The backlash toward women reporting rape is made clear in this novel.  The characters were believable and the plot twist is a good one.  The psychology behind the decisions each character makes is sound and I found myself thinking I may have made similar decisions if confronted with the same scenerio.  I look forward to reading another book by this author.,4

3220,Intriguing story line. The end was a little rushed for my liking.,4
3221,"Intriguing story, with a pretty good twist I certainly didn't see coming! Well outlined characters and Definitely worth the read.",4
3222,"Is a Rolls Royce worth the money? I guess the answer is: if you can afford it. So, given this shaver costs around three times my current one, I would expect it to deliver.On the whole, it does. In general, I've found that with Braun products you do get what you pay for, and this certainly does a good job compared to other electric shavers I've tried. I don't think you can beat a good shave with a blade, but for convenience and comfort this is a great alternative. I particularly like the fact that it can be used wet or dry - so if you want a quick retouch in the evening it's a five minute job, but you can also save time in the morning by shaving in the shower. A full charge should last you several days, but there is also a quick charge option if you need it in a hurry without having to wait for it to charge. It is largely plastic, but well designed as I would expect.So, I would say it is worth the money - if you can afford it.",4
3223,"Is okay, not a great fit on my air vent on Renault Captur, but firm grip for phone.",4
3224,It arrived within the time advise. The item replaced an older model and had a few better function. Great for the job designed,4
3225,it certainly makes a big difference to room. it does not give total blackout but it is the best I have used and I am quite happy with this purchase,4
3226,"It cleans teeth....i may have done the typical bloke thing and gone for the extra functionality options, as all I use is the clock, the same head and the same clean function. What I can say is I am glad to have gone down the electric toothbrush route I clearly was brushing too hard, nicely indicated by the only red item, flashing on the handle rather than coming from my gums.my partner subsequently bought the 4000. As for the iPod app functionality well ot appears you need to have your phone with you when you brush, hmm I'm not going to take my iPhone into the bathroom.",4
3227,"It does a basic job, my window isn't even all the way round the edges and this creates gaps of light I have to duct tape over.It is portable and easy to put up, material blocks light.",4
3228,"It does a good job, but you could probably get away with the version below this one, and save a little money.",4
3229,It does keep the light out and would be great for a childs bedroom. My only problem is it won't stay stuck on the window.,4
3230,It does not work on my windows at home but worked many time while travelling. Windows i have at home there is lots of wood frames on it. But for plain windows works perfectly.,4
3231,it does the job - sturdy build,4
3232,"It does the job as it says. Although, it doesn't exactly block the whole window as sometimes light can come through edges but it's enough to give me the most luxurious sleep ever. Very convenient as it doesn't involve any permanent installations. Definitely recommend.",4
3233,"It does the job but it is not very pretty. It is practical, easy to install.",4
3234,It does the job very well.Bluetooth and their app (Android):  I have noticed that the app looses connection with the toothbrush while in use.,4
3235,It does the job. Sun rises at 4 am in the morning where I am living. Thanks to this curtain my baby sleeps until late hours and it is hard to wake him up without taking this off :)The suction is really strong but the only thing that needs to be improved is stitches. Sunshine comes from the stitches of the curtain.,4
3236,It does what its supposed to although quite big so difficult as still gaps at the edge but overall works well,4

3238,it is easy to handle,4
3239,"it is noisier than my previous electric toothbrush and I keep forgetting tp use the app element, but it's a very good toothbrush and my teeth feel great after brushing.  I really like the red light that comes on if I'm brushing areas too hard and the battery light indicator is useful too.",4
3240,"It is OK but as far as my own experience, Phillips rotary shavers gives u a cleaner look.",4
3241,"It is ok, has been working fon for 4 month, does that job",4

3244,It needs to be secured well otherwise there is a danger of it coming loose while driving.,4
3245,It seems very well written and felt engaging throughout. The end left me a little empty but that's just me.,4
3246,It takes 24 hours to get this brush fully charged. Too long.Everything is profect other than that.,4

3248,It took me a little while to get into the story but it was certainly worth while!,4
3249,"It took me awhile to get into this book, it started off quite slow and the whole eclipse storyline wasn't really my thing.However I soon got hooked to it, once I had finished it I actually put it down and thought ""I really enjoyed that""Not the best book I've read but certainly not one of the worst...nice few twists and turns.",4
3250,It was a good read kept me interested. Like the idea of eclipse chasers. Nice little twist at the end.,4
3251,It was a slow burner I didn't initially think it was great but it picked up nicely in the second half and had a twist I did not see coming even though I read a lot of books in this genre.  Unique and twisty - recommend!,4
3252,"It was good. But there is no transitional Chinese in it! Only simplify Chinese, that’s very disturbing. A language that was originally designed for uncultured people.",4
3253,"It wasn’t sure about the story line at first but didn’t want to stop listening! Incredible writing, great story with incredible twists and turns.",4
3254,It working! Only the suction not very hard. But I keep it in my bedroom and is perfect!.,4
3255,It works,4
3256,"It works well in cleaning teeth, but is a bit noisy and takes for ever to recharge.",4
3257,"It would be perfect... If it covered the window properly. But it does the job, despite some of the suckers coming off a bit too easily during the night.I'd still recommend.",4
3258,It's a bit too sophisticated for me - I probably should have purchased a more basic model. The battery charge lasts for ages though.andit leaves my teeth feeling really clean.,4
3259,"It's a good product, but found it difficult to get the ohone out of it without taking it off the vent every time",4
3260,"It's a good toothbrush and was a replacement for an older one I had, which served me well.  However, don't believe the battery life Oral B say it can do.  2 weeks is stretching it somewhat, a week definitely without minimal notice of speed of the head decreasing.  It's still a good toothbrush, it's just annoying when companies embellish what something can really do.  That's the only reason it's not 5 stars for me.",4
3261,"It's a great toothbrush. The bluetooth clock display thingy is great. When you turn the brush on, it immediately starts to tell you which quadrant of your mouth to brush and when you should change, and when you're done it indicates how good of a job you did, which is nice. Always good to get a bit of approval in the morning, even if it is from a simplistic smiley face on a clock that's wirelessly connected to your toothbrush.The toothbrush has a bunch of modes, I'm not even sure what all of them do, but I use the sensitive mode because I have a tendency to overbrush, and my wife uses the regular mode. These work well, and there's an obvious difference between them. The different modes genuinely do seem to do what they're supposed to, it's not just a con to sell you a more expensive toothbrush.The only annoying thing is the time it takes to charge. A device you're supposed to use twice a day, should ideally take no more than the interval between to charge. This takes over 24 hours. I don't know if that's a fault with our toothbrush (which otherwise works perfectly) or a more general thing, but roughly once a week, you're going to have to take this off the charger before it's finished, use it, then put it back again to finish off, which is a bit annoying and the reason I've docked it a star. Admittedly this would be far less of a problem if we had shaver sockets in our bathroom, but as it is the brush is charged in the bedroom and I have to remember to take it off the charger to use it on those days, and put it back. Not a big hassle, but enough to make you grumble a bit.",4
3262,It's a lot of money for a toothbrush and the Bluetooth is so fiddly that I gave up with it.However it does record on the separate gadget how well the teeth were brushes so my son can no longer pretend he's done a good job in ten seconds.,4
3263,It's a really good toothbrush. I feel it cleans teeth much better than a regular toothbrush. The display is kinda useless. So is the app and bluetooth feature. I used it for a month and then didn't bother anymore.,4
3264,It's almost been a month. My teeth feel cleaner for sure and I'm sure my dentist won't moan as much. My only issue is that the battery is supposed to last for two weeks...mine goes for 10 days MAX. Just remember to take a spare brush for those 2 week breaks.,4
3265,"It's been a while since I have been so gripped by a book. I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days.Initially I found the order of events confusing but soon got into the swing of present tense and historic tense.Full of twists and turns, kept me wondering until the end as to who was telling the truth.",4
3266,"It's fine, it holds my phone allowing me to use it as a satnav - just what I needed",4
3267,It's fine. Does what it's supposed to do.,4
3268,it's good,4
3269,"It's good and sturdy. Survived a 4 hour motorway journey and is still going strong. It doesn't quite attach to my air vent properly, but it doesn't fall off at all on the bumpiest of roads and even after I've spent a while poking at my smart phone while it's mounted in the holder",4
3270,"It's good, I'm glad I bought it but it doesn't quite work for our window because of where the suckers are attached so it always leaves a bit of light",4
3271,"It's good, in that it fits the air vent securely, and holds the device equally securely. I bought it so that I could use satnav on my phone, replacing a standalone device.The standalone satnav attached to the windscreen, occasionally fell off, and was a little bit of a pain attach and detach. However I've realised that having a satnav in a forward position on the windscreen is far better than having it attached to the air vent, in terms of it being easily within my line of sight. That's not really a criticism of this product, but it does mean that I'm likely to look at a windscreen mount for my smartphone, or go back to a standalone sat nav.",4
3272,It's great only snag is that it's very slow for charging and the picture taking quality is very poor. All in all tho its a winner with my son and keeps him busy for long time and he doesn't want to put it down which is a problem - it's addictive so now trying to wean him off and limit how much he uses of it.,4
3273,It's great. Blocks out all light only problem is the sucker arnt great.,4
3274,It's OK for what it is but sometimes it flicks off when I'm getting my phone into it which is frustrating,4
3275,It's quite slow to get into (I almost gave up!) but suchhh a good read when you stick with it. Well worth a read!!,4
3276,It's very good and dark. Bit expensive.,4
3277,"It’s a very good blend, and completely blacks out my sons window so it does work wonders. The only down side is I found it very hard to put up! Took so long to stick on the window, so be patient I suppose",4
3278,It’s not a bad book to read,4
3279,Item as described.,4
3280,"its a good toothbrush, although i don't see the £100+ value in it, i never use the bluetooth ot the different setting options..if you find it on sale ot in a lightning deal then buy it otherwise just buy one of the cheaper versions",4
3281,Its good,4
3282,"Its good and sturdy,",4
3283,Its good screen protector,4
3284,Its okay but not as good as the one I replaced,4
3285,just as described quick delivery,4
3286,Keeps the light out but doesn't stick very well to the window. Can be used in various places.,4
3287,"Keeps the light out just as it says, but on our windows we could not have one open when the blinds are up. This meant the room got very hot in late July hot spell.But it does what it says, other window designs may not suffer the same concerns",4
3288,Keeps the room nice and dark.,4
3289,Keeps the room nice and dark.  Sometimes the suckers come away and can be difficult to put up.,4
3290,Keeps you guessing till the end.,4
3291,Keeps you on tender hooks!,4
3292,Keeps you wondering what happens next,4
3293,Keeps your attention from page 1. Little twists make it interesting. Loved the setting around the eclipses.,4
3294,Kept me guessing all the way to the end,4
3295,"Kept me thinking right up to the end, not what I expected from the title.Excellent readWell done Erin Kelly",4
3296,Kept me wondering,4
3297,Kids love 'em - had a few issues setting them up as the process is not very clear but like the controls and they are pretty robust.,4
3298,Kids love it.Con: the prime videos don't play in kids unlimited even though I've linked the prime account to the tablet.,4
3299,"Kinda annoying having to use the suction things, so we put up Velcro along our window surrounds which makes it ao much easier. But definitely blocks out the sun at 4:30 in the morning!",4
3300,"Kit and Laura, sun eclipse chasers, are embarking on their first eclipse as a couple. Completely mesmerised by the magic of it all, they envision their future eclipse chases and all is right with the world.Until they find a lost purse on the ground, Laura picks it up to find its owner and stumbles across the most horrendous act taking place. A young woman is being raped by a man.Warning to some, this does involve a graphic description of rape which may trigger distress.The case goes to court, where the victim, Beth, is relentlessly shamed and hounded by the defence. It gets into the he said/she said controversy, sparking media interest as the accused is from a wealthy, well respected family.After the trial she strikes up an intense relationship with Laura.This book is told in 2 different time frames - in 1999 when the appalling event happened and present day when both Kit and Laura are terrified by the thought of seeing Beth again. But why? What happened to make them afraid? And exactly whose secret is destroying them?This book builds up very slowly in the first half, leading to an absolute blinder of a twist.Kelly takes on many difficult subjects in this story. The judicial system in the process of rape cases and how very flawed it is. What happens to the people after such a gruelling process, both the victim and the accused.It's a very well thought out story, very thought provoking and gripping.I thought this book was fantastic.Huge thanks to Crime Files Books for a copy of this book in exchange for an open and honest review.",4
3301,"Kit is an eclipse chaser, something he’s been doing since he was a child. In 1999, he attends a festival in Cornwall with new girlfriend Laura to see an eclipse, which they watch together. Returning to the campsite, they see what Laura assumes is a rape. This incident impacts the rest of their lives together, and they become embroiled in a situation where no one really knows who’s telling the truth. And Beth, the alleged victim, won’t leave them alone.The story flips between what happens at the festival and its aftermath and the present day - 2015. Laura and Kit are living under assumed names, terrified of their past catching up with them. Laura is pregnant with twins and Kit is about to set off to the Faroe Islands to see a last eclipse before fatherhood. We hear the story from both Laura and Kit, which works really well to set up the tension and to create an atmosphere where the reader doesn’t really know what, or who, to believe.I did really enjoy reading this book. It’s a clever plot with a twist that is genuinely surprising. The characters are well-drawn and, unlike some other reviewers, I did warm to them, particularly Laura, and could definitely understand her motivations. It was a real page-turner.However, there were a couple of things that didn’t really work for me. Laura and Kit keep referring to an incident in Zambia, after the alleged assault. It is hinted that something major happened. When this was revealed it was a real let down. And they also refer to a video online that is terribly upsetting for Laura. Again, it isn’t, and this is another let down. If things are built up like this, then the reader deserves something worthy of all that tension.That said, this is a really good read. The author understands how to build tension and how to keep a reader engaged. I’d definitely recommend it.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing a copy for review.",4
3302,Laura and Kit are at a festival at the LIzard in Cornwall to see the total eclipse of the sun.  The weather spoils the spectacle and on the way back to their tent Laura stumbles across a man assaulting a woman.  Now over fifteen years later their lives are still somewhat controlled by the events at that festival.  Laura is pregnant with twins and Kit is off to watch another eclipse but their lives are going to be turned upside down again and secrets they have both been keeping will come to light.  I don't often enjoy books that switch back and forth in time and from one character to another but I was soon gripped by the story and eager to find out what would happen.  Really enjoyable read.,4
3303,"Laura Langrishe and her boyfriend Christopher ‘Kit’ McCall are at a festival in Cornwall celebrating the 1999 solar eclipse when Laura interrupts the apparent rape of Beth Taylor.  The police are called, and a man named Jamie Balcombe is arrested.  Beth is grateful to Laura and Kit.  Once Jamie is convicted, Beth becomes even closer to Laura and Kit and showers them both with expensive gifts.  But Beth’s behaviour changes, and Kit and Laura go to great lengths to distance themselves from her.By 2015, Kit and Laura have changed their names and are living in the shadows.  Laura is pregnant, and despite her fear of what might happen if Beth finds them, supports Kit as he travels overseas to witness another eclipse.  Surely, Beth cannot find them, now?’Memory, I was discovering, acts completely differently when you give it a little notice.’The fifteen-year gap in the story is filled in as the narration shifts between Laura and Kit.  Slowly, carefully, the whole story unfolds in stages as though it were phases of an eclipse.Part way through the story, I thought I knew exactly how it was going to end.  I was wrong.  A shift in the story took me by surprise, and almost had me put the book down – never to be completed.  I was annoyed, but kept reading.  A few pages later, I was again engrossed in the story and while the shift still irritated, it took the story in a different (and ultimately more interesting) direction.There are a number of twists and turns in this novel, obscuring the truth.  Until the end.  Why do people act the way that they do, and who can be believed?If you like psychological thrillers, if you don’t mind the improbable as well as the possible, then you may also enjoy this novel. I did.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Hachette Australia for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith",4

3306,"Let me start this review by saying, it has been an absolute game-changer in our house. Please don’t be put off my the negatives in this review, as they are more niggling annoyances than dealbreakers. I have hope that Amazon will change these few things, but even if they don’t, it is still one of the best things I’ve ever bought for my son. My son is three but is severely delayed in speech and some development. There are questions over sensory issues and autism, but no diagnosis, though we are seeing professionals. I’m telling you, as this is the reason this machine is a game-changer for us. We’ve had it since Black Friday.Pros -🔹Two year no quibble warranty - I don’t think I’d have bought something this expensive for him (£89.99 in the Black Friday sale, but £129.99 normally) if I didn’t know it would be replaced if he broke it. It’s actually fairly sturdy in the case, though, and we also bought a screen protector. It’s been thrown a fair few times already and hasn’t broken.🔹One year free Amazon Kids Unlimited - this meant I didn’t have to buy loads of apps to see which ones he likes, we can try them all and then when this ends, I’ll either just buy the apps he likes or if it’s worth it, get Amazon Prime and pay the £1.99 for it. We shall see, but we have a year to decide. Added bonus is it includes videos, so we are actually planning on getting rid of the kids channels on tv, saving £5 a month.🔹Adding apps from AppStore - it allows you to add apps from the adult store as well, so I’ve been able to put Netflix, BBCiPlayerKids and VLC, so that’s extra shows and things he can watch. He can also choose himself which ones he wants to watch.🔹Adding favourite apps to home - you can add all the favourite apps to home, so you don’t have to go looking for them, as there doesn’t seem to be much rhyme or reason to the way they are set out in “Books” “Videos” and “Apps”.🔹Got my phone back! - having this tablet means I don’t keep getting my phone stolen to play on apps anymore. It’s annoying when we’re out and I’ve forgotten it, but it’s awesome when he has it.🔹Interactivity - he isn’t just mindlessly staring at a TV screen. I love that the games are interactive, and he has to engage his brain. Yes it’s screen time, but there aren’t just videos, there are games he likes to play.🔹 Seen a few people complain that they couldn’t play own films, if they are downloaded movies (.mp4) you can add VLC player from the AppStore, and with a small bit of faffing in the settings, you can get the included films on it.Cons -🔸Amazon Carousel - Probably the most annoying feature. It refreshes the home page constantly, which is laggy, just so the last app used is at the front. And you have to swipe up to get to the apps you have added to home, which doesn’t always work when it’s refreshing so takes a few goes. It would be much better if the apps stayed stationary, or the carousel was on a different area to home. An option to switch that off or move it would be brilliant.🔸Download Apps to try - You have to download each app to try it, which takes time and memory. At first I tried to download them all to save time, quickly realised it was full already on the 32gb. I’m going to get a 64gb card at some point, which will possibly solve that problem.🔸No YouTube - lol I understand Google and Amazon are currently at war, which is a shame as it would be nice to be able to use the kids YouTube, my son loves StoryBots, and Amazon doesn’t have any of their apps, so it would be good if he could watch the little videos on YouTube. Though he can watch whole episodes on Netflix, so not the end of the world.🔸Doesn’t group Videos on Home - You can only add individual videos to home, it would be nice to be able to have a folder of videos in home of the same cartoon.Limiting setting changes - again, I minor annoyance, but it would be nice to be able to properly tailor the feel of the kids app to my son, but it’s fairly take it as you get it. He seems to have gotten the hang of it now but we’re mostly an Apple house, so it took a while for him to work it out.🔸Volume Cuts out - yeah, there seems to be a glitch, with the BBC apps I think, that makes the media volume cut out completely and you have to turn the machine off and on again to get it back.🔸Could be louder - i guess I’m just gonna have to get my son wearing headphones, but it would be nice to be able to turn it up a bit more lol some of the videos I added myself are very quiet.All in all, it’s made our lives better, and if Amazon could just sort those few niggling problems, then it would make it go from 4star to 5star 👍🏽",4
3307,"Lets get the main question out of the way first; Is this good? Yes; if you can afford to spend the money on it is is undeniably great quality, and it can do what it claims to do. Not only is the quality and the gimmick great, but it does look and feel expensive; From the design, feel and colour, to the sleek design and smooth weight in your hands - It is luxurious stuff. However I've removed a star as a £300+ RRP for an electric shaver that needs 'cleaning station' refills every few months does seem excessive - surely they could make the refills last for longer?And now lets get the other main bits out of the way: the charge time is impressive to our household; It charges in under an hour and has great battery life. My epilator takes between one and two hours, as does our old men's razor and [head] hair shaver.The results last twice as long as using other electric shavers - the same length of time as a regular close-shave razor. It is much faster in comparison to other shavers too, as I don't need to rerun it over the same patch of skin multiple times. Applying pressure as you hold it against your skin doesn't cause the shaving head to shift and/or jam, and it doesn't tug or scratch skin either, so this makes a fast, effective, and pain-free hair removal method.And here's the bit that you are paying the big bucks for; not only it can clean itself automatically when you put it in it's charger, but it can also be used wet or dry, and for either shaving or grooming.We have a shaver which has a cleaning station and we have a wet/dry combi shaver & groomer, but having everything rolled into one device is fantastic - we can clear the half dozen different grooming gadgets out of the cabinet now, and just stick with this as it does it all.Our eldest is currently 'experimenting' with varying kinds of goatees & sideburns, and he confirms that the groomer settings all work as well as the instructions say they will, so full marks in that regard._No-one has suffered from any skin irritation from using this, another plus. For holidays I no longer need to bother with separate razors, our old beard trimmer and all of the separate chargers. This is the only thing we need now.",4
3308,Lets me know when I'm brushing too hard - great.  Teeth do feel cleaner too.  I don't use the bluetooth much yet tho - holding my phone and toothbrush at the same time is a bit much.,4
3309,Life saver. One of the small rubber valves did break/tear after a couple of weeks though. Had to buy replacement valves. Buttons getting worn out only after a month or so. Product still works for now. Hopefully it wont break on me.,4
3310,Lighter than expected but look good,4
3311,like it,4
3312,Like other reviewers I found this book a bit slow at the beginning but then after half way I couldn't put it down so well worth persevering! You really don't know who to believe and you really won't guess the ending! A brilliant book but the all her books are!,4
3313,"Like others I am a bit bemused by the Bluetooth connectivity.  It's a toothbrush, why would I want it talking to my phone?  As for the smart guide, I think I should know how to clean my teeth by now.  Besides I need to make sure they are clean and give them a really long clean.I have to say it is a nice and powerful brush.  Quickly charged up and was ready to go.  With four heads in the box, I won't need to buy any more for a while.The toothbrush gives a very good deep clean, and you only need a little bit of toothpaste on the brush, so should hopefully save me a bit of money when it comes to toothpaste!",4
3314,Like these earrings - arrived promptly - reasonable price.,4
3315,Little expensive for what it is but works perfectly. Much nicer design than the ones that stick to the windscreen.,4
3316,Lived up to expectations far better than the previous generation electric toothbrushes .  Good selection of cleaning options . Rotary sped and pressure control is good . Easily visible light prompt when to much pressure is applied . Comfortable to hold.,4
3317,"Looks excellent!! Now its charging.The shipping was super fast, was a week early than the original arrival date.The only con is that the travel case is simple and not the Premium travel case that is written in rhe description.",4
3318,"Looks fab, but bought as present & it hasn’t been used yet, hence 4 stars",4
3319,Looks good - quite small but then I dont really know what I was expecting to be honest.I have bought this for my brother for Christmas so cannot comment much further.,4
3320,Looks good but early days so hope for the best.,4
3321,Looks good but not exactly to the price,4
3322,"Looks pretty good so far. Bought for my daughter as a Christmas present, lots of cartoons and games already on device which is clear and good quality. Disappointed that you cannot set the childrens page as the homepage, my daughter wont be able to turn this on without an adult being present because of the passwords and changing profiles.",4
3323,Lot's of unnecessary clutter comes with it but the toothbrush is performing well. It is loud and not as fast as I was expecting but has been a definite improvement on the sonic one I had before.,4
3324,"Lots of different modes for different types of brushing. Standard oral B brush heads work with these so lots of different types to choose from and simple to replace. Connects easily to your device via Bluetooth and use with the app to keep track of your brushing activities.The battery however isn't great, only lasting a few brushes at full 3 bars. As soon as it drops to 2 or less bars you do notice a decrease in power - therefore it's not brushing as effectively. That would be my only complaint.",4
3325,"Lots of features and brushing options and included different types of heads to try out. The app connects easily and works well to give various ""courses"" to help target your cleaning regimes as well as stats etc on your routine. Only big downside is due to the Bluetooth battery life is not very long, at least compared to my wife's sonicare non Bluetooth toothbrush.",4
3326,"Lots of gimmicks for gadget lovers, we will not use half of them",4
3327,Lots of twists and turns and although I didn't particularly like the ending I did enjoy this book. Love the unusual back drop of this tale and enjoyed most of the characters.,4
3328,Lots to think about in this book and a surprising twist at the very end. But very slow to start.,4
3329,Love it but it does keep falling down so I ended up nailing mine to the window frame and let the bottom half loose. Which works perfect for us as we are not going to travel with it!,4
3330,Love it so far well worth the money amd my little one loves it.,4
3331,"Love it,  but app is a step to far for me.",4
3332,"Love the brush, very technical",4
3333,Love the brush. My only criticism would be the lack of instructions. Makes some of the features redundant unless you invest a lot of time understanding them,4
3334,"Love the design and accessories provided. The only fault with this model is the battery life. The full charge, which takes about 24 hours, only provided just a week of cleaning twice a day.",4
3335,Love the new toothbrush. Only downside is the battery life as requires a recharge every 3 days or so.,4
3336,"Love the shaver, although i had the Series 7 and do not see any great changes while shaving. But a good shaver all the same",4
3337,Love this product - easy to use with different speeds to suit you and the moulded cup is comfortable during use. Only recommendation would be to have it directly attach to storage containers to save you expressing into the bottle and transferring into storage bags multiple times a day.,4
3338,Love this toothbrush genuinely makes your teeth feel properly cleaned.,4
3339,"Loved the,story line in this book loads of twists and turns that I didn't see coming! Didn't want to put it down!",4
3340,"Loved this book, slowly unravels as you read it.  Just as I thought I knew what was going on, the book would change direction and something else would emerge.  Characters that were believable and a brilliant story line to match.Laura and Kit are in Cornwall watching an eclipse and Laura stumbles on a brutal attack by accident.  What follows next is a court case and a friendship comes from this but Laura soon starts to think that things are not what they seem.  Then slowly the book starts unraveling and it’s fast paced to get to the finish line.",4
3341,Loved this was an easy holiday read but couldn't put it down .... I only worked it out right at the end !,4
3342,Lovely but smaller than I thought they would be.  Still nice to wear,4
3343,Lovely but the packaging is a bit cheap,4
3344,Lovely close shave. The dock will mostly tell you you need to clean it even after 1 shave.,4
3345,Lovely earing got them on blue as well,4
3346,Lovely earrings look amazing,4
3347,Lovely earrings not too long,4
3348,lovely earrings very pleased bought for a xmas present,4
3349,lovely gift for a 4year old.,4
3350,"Lovely looking earrings but the silver fish hook is very flimsy and quite sharp. They come with clear plastic butterfly ""bungs"" to hold the earrings in place.",4
3351,Lovely product. Shame they don't mention it is designed to be charged from a shaver socket. I had to go and buy an adaptor.,4
3352,Lovely quality,4
3353,Lovely unit. Still getting used to using it though.,4
3354,"Lovely, love the sparkle",4
3355,"Managed to fit them to the windows and they do black out any light they cover, however the light still comes in the top of the window as the puckers have to start at the glass. Tried to secure to the window frame to avoid this but they don't stick",4
3356,Many twists that kept you guessing until the very end.,4
3357,"Mechanically this is a perfectly sound toothbrush. You turn it on, the end vibrates, and you can brush your teeth. This however, is something which would be achieved just as well on a toothbrush costing a fraction of the cost of this. What then does this premium price tag buy?It arrives in a huge box, albeit one with a spelling error in plain view as one of the main product features. Not a promising start. Inside there is a gigantic chunk of non recyclable polystyrene. The box contains plenty besides the toothbrush, including a chunky plastic case for four brush heads (four different ones are supplied), a carrying case, a charging dock, a stand alone timer, and a manual which has several more spelling errors in it.My previous toothbrush was the model below this, which seemed to be identical in every way except the headline feature of this model - bluetooth connectivity. It seems everything now needs bluetooth and an app, so I downloaded the Oral-B app from the app store and tried it out for a few days. The app is essentially a replacement for the stand alone timer, with some minor added functionality, such as logging whenever the toothbrush is used. If you have multiple family members using the same toothbrush base, then the app will of course record all of those uses. As long as the app was running I could still get it to sync from the next room, so if all you care about is logging then there's no need to take your phone into the bathroom with you. Personally I brush my teeth twice a day even without the lure of a smiley face in an app, so I won't be using this gimmick again. The app does at least give you news headlines to read while brushing, which is nice enough if slightly reminiscent of being stuck in an airport waiting room watching those bland international news feed stations they always seem to have playing.One downside which could cause annoyance- the toothbrush emits a blinking blue light when charging, which is clearly visible in my bedroom when the toothbrush is charging in the en suite. It's not a subtle light at all, it's seriously bright. I haven't yet found any way to disable it.There's nothing wrong with this toothbrush (disclaimer: I got it for free from the Amazon Vine programme), but it smacks of a product with needless extras slapped onto it to justify a high price tag. You can do without all of them, so buy a cheaper model and save yourself some money.",4
3358,Messy to put up and remove but did the job very well.,4
3359,"Mostly an excellent choice with various brushing speeds, a good range of brush attachments and long battery life between charges. Loses a star for price and for confusing and unnecessary bluetooth functionality.",4
3360,"Move had this a few months now, it stays stuck to the window. It's a bit of a faff of you want to let some light into the room or open the window. However it does the job.Would rate it 5 stars if it had a draw cord or something.",4
3361,Moved at a good pace and kept my attention the whole way through with plenty of genuinely surprising twists and turns.,4
3362,"Much better than my toothbrush but it has to be charged quite regularly, every 3-4 brushes.",4
3363,My 2 year old love's it! I even use it to read my books when I can get my hands on it and use the internet. Only negative reflecting my 4 star score is you cannot download certain apps that you can on Android and some features you cant use on kids profile like Prime video so have to let her on my profile.,4
3364,"My 3 year old loves this! Ideal for little ones and very easy to use, good range of content and lots of parental controls. Timers etc can be set however I am yet to use these as I simply monitor the time myself, for older children these would be useful.",4
3365,"My 5 year old if on this machine  often and for long periods of times most days.  He loves the games and shows you can watch.  I do not like that Kindle is picky with what headphones work witht heir products as I do not like hearing all his little kids things playing on it.  To use youtube or subway surfers I have to switch user to my husband's profile which is a bit annoying at times. they are always password protected to I always have to switch it as my husband cannot remember it lol--- meaning when screen locks when not used for my son to oppen it again I have to punch in a code often.  Not as good as I would expect or hope.  It is sturdy, strong and no probles so far. He has had it since Christmas.",4
3366,My 6 year loves this is fantastic.  Is complicated to set up as you cannot get kids u tube on standard fire have to do through an adult account but once done is easy to use,4
3367,My baby loves it,4
3368,"My baby only ever slept in pitch black, even with a black out blind and curtain linings  cracks of light still come around the edge! It meant staying away overnight was pot luck in summer as to whether the room would have black out, this is now as pivital for our family as the travel cot or nappies!My only criticism is I sturggle to use it on small windows as the fold up bit isn't easy BUT highly recommended in general!",4
3369,My boy loves it he won’t put it down,4
3370,"My first venture into the world of electric tooth brushing! Over all i'm really impressed with this product. The timing features with or without the external timer are very useful. I didn't realise how little time I spent brushing before having a timer! The battery life is decent, although not having a plug in the bathroom makes it a little cumbersome to charge, and I find I am running out of battery more often than perhaps I would if I had a shave point plug to use in the bathroom to keep it charging regularly.The main downside to this is that bluetooth syncing functionality. When the app is open on your phone it works flawlessly, however the app NEEDS to be open on your phone otherwise the data isn't synced. I didn't realise this and feel that the syncing should happen as I don't always have my phone with me in the bathroom and even if I do, I don't open the app (as I'm busy brushing my teeth). This is only a small niggle, and still use the brush at least twice a day and feel my teeth are in better condition for it.",4
3371,My great grandchild plays with it and enjoys using it.,4
3372,"My iPhone 6s slides out of the mount when held vertical, but rotated landscape it works very well, small discrete and very easy to fit.",4
3373,"My last toothbrush was a sonic which I was keen to replace until I did a bit of research, Pubmed did a clinical study and in short the oscillating-rotating brush won. There conclusion was that ""an advanced oscillating-rotating power toothbrush produced substantial, statistically superior reductions in plaque and gingivitis via multiple outcome measures compared to a new sonic toothbrush after both four weeks and 12 weeks of tooth brushing"". They used the Oral-B Pro 5000, The trail was done in 2013 I don't no if the 6000 was invented then.What I have also learned, and I think this is right, all the oral-B Pros have the same ""daily clean"" mode, as you go higher up you get more modes such as gum care, sensitive, whitening and deep clean, the teeth cleaning bit was my most important criteria, in hindsight I only really need the daily clean mode, but I am making a conscious effort to use the other modes!  I haven't down loaded the phone app yet but I will at some point, I do wonder if it is a bit of a novelty. I found the amount of different oral-B pro's overwhelming, It was only once I got the 6000 and was researching on getting another one as a gift that I finally understand it, I hope I have helped if your in a similar situation.I am still very happy with my purchase by the way.",4
3374,"My only other experience with electric shavers was a dirty cheap one, which did almost nothing.  This time I thought I would buy the top of the range to ensure I get the best.  This is a good shaver, however it still something missed the odd hair and refuses to cut it... I end up flipping it around and using the trimmer just to get one stray hair.Battery life is great, I only need to charge every couple of weeks which means if I go away I only need to take the shaver itself - the case is a very smart leather case.For cleaning, I have found you just need to rinse the head and I am not sure I will use the fluid.  It has run out now and I'm unlikely to replace.",4
3375,"My partner has been asked to review the Braun 9040s wet/dry shaver.For years he's been using disposable razors, so this definitely was a luxurious 'step up' and he's been thrilled so far.The shaver feels nice and comfortable in his hands, is not too noisy and gives such an effective, close shave. The head adapts to every curve of his face and doesn't pull on his skin, meaning it is no longer irritated after he shaves.We did not get to try the trim function due to my partner's beard length.It's waterproof and cordless, so he can shave in the shower meaning he no longer leaves his beard stubble in the bathroom sink!He would definitely recommend this to all of his friends, though of course it's a big 'investment' if all you're used to are disposable razors.",4
3376,"My partner used this product, was a little disappointed that it did not have the charging dock. He feels it is a bit too complex with so many different settings and ways of using it so found it difficult to use at first. The moustache trimmer part of the shaver is awkward to use as you cannot see clearly hoe much of the moustache you are taking off so mistakes can be made.",4
3377,"My previous OralB brush is 4 years old and the battery life is getting lower, so I was looking to get a new one when this popped up on Black Friday at 25% off - so cheaper than the one I was contemplating buying.It's as good as the previous one, though has too many flashing lights and will light up your bathroom when it is on charge, so could be awkward if you need to charge it in the bedroom. I preferred the old LCD display.Also I had to charge it on an un-level surface in a hotel the other day, and it did not seem to charge even though the charging light was flashing.I don't intend to used the app, but the clock and timer are useful to keep the brushing on track.The Oral B brushes are definitely good as I have not had a filling for many years (this is my fourth OralB), but probably I would have chosen the slightly cheaper version if it had not been for the offer.",4
3378,My son loves it bought it for his 5th birthday. Have no issues currently a I haven't fully explored most of the apps on the tablet,4
3379,My son loves it! Very easy to use.,4
3380,My son loves this!,4
3381,My teeth feel like they've gone through a deep clean every time with this. The timer is pretty useful too to make sure you always try and do it properly.,4
3382,My teeth feel so much cleaner well my old electric tooth brush was over 10 years old!!!,4
3383,"My wee one got this as a birthday present, excellent variety of apps for kids and easy to use",4
3384,Neat design. Pity the transformer/cable dont' fit italian or american sockets. Possible to order a suitable one?,4
3385,Never guessed the ending for this story it was gripping right until th3 end,4
3386,Nice and comfy and doesn't hurt. Has multiple settings and speeds which helps to get more milk. Also the letdown setting on it is great to help your milk to gone down. It has different speeds on both the letdown and pumping stages.It fits nicely over the Breast and has lots of support.Only downsides are . When removing there seems to be milk is the padding that goes around your breast which seems to get wasted.,4
3387,"Nice and compact, does what it says on the tin :)",4
3388,Nice bit of kit but the electrical lead is shorter than previous models and has caused us some relocation problems,4
3389,Nice brush but charge does not seem to last as long as suggested,4
3390,nice but not much of an improvement on the 7 series. if at all... arrived promptly and proved reliable so no complaints,4
3391,nice christmas present,4
3392,"Nice clear picture for the kids and when partnered with headphones it becomes the ultimate companion for long car journeys. Best to buy with as much built in storage as possible as it soon disappears when downloading movies in highest quality.Great no quibble warranty and one years access included to a great kids download library. Its a shame Prime access can't be linked (for Prime free content) with movies still needing to be separately purchased to download and take on the go i.e. you have to use Wi-Fi to access the Kids library subscription for movies. But there you go. Apps/games can be downloaded from the kids library. If it wasn't for the movies point, it would have been 5 stars.",4
3393,nice for money but very small,4
3394,Nice gift for Secret Santa looks way more expensive than it is,4
3395,nice neat earring,4
3396,Nice one,4
3397,Nice product will recommend to buy!,4
3398,"Nice Product. I certainly brush my teeth for a longer period each session. However, I'm not entirely sure it suits with my sensitive gums.",4
3399,Nice small earrings good for price paid,4
3400,Nice wee earrings. The only thing i would say is that they could easily come off your ear if brushed against the collar of a jacket.,4
3401,"Nice, small holder, comes out of the vent a little v too easily, but good value for money",4
3402,no issues,4
3403,No real need for the blue tooth attachment but cleans my teeth very well.,4
3404,"Not a genre I typically read but once the story got going I couldn't put it down.I went into this blind & I'm glad for it. A few times I thought I had it figured out, only for the story to take a turn and my theories were turned to dust.It was a little predictable at times but it was definitely a page turner for me and I'm happy I decided to pick it up.",4
3405,Not as gripping as I'd hoped but a good read,4
3406,"Not bad - glad I had one for a caravan holiday - not perfect though, the suckers aren't great and didn't stick throughout the night, but still useful.",4
3407,"not easiest to use, but does the job",4
3408,not fast moving,4
3409,"Not much I can say that hasn't been said already in other reviewsThis will be my 4th Braun shaver (not counting the 2 travel Brauns)Bought this to replace my 7 series as it developed a fault, started to get noisy and didn't shave anymore and at times would clamp on hairs and pull them out (it went for repairs but the fault came back 3 months later)Comparing the 9 series to the 7 series, they are both similar except the 9 series has an extra strip for lifting stray hairs and a battery life indicator.  Seems to shave just as close as the 7 but 9 seems quicker to complete the task.  Not as comfy to hold as 7 but fine.  7 and 9 series charging cable are the same rating and fit, so able to reuse old one as well.When cleaning I only wash the detached cartridge head and avoid washing the actual base head (brush only) as I think the hard water is what damaged the 7 series for me and it left ugly limescale deposits. It may be waterproof but there are still exposed moving parts when the cartridge is removed.  The rinsed 7 series cartridge can be balanced it on its side for drying, the 9 series you can't (I'm nit-picking here).  The carrycase is a little larger for the 9 compared to the 7.  The only doubt in my mind is how reliable it will be as only having had my 7 for 3 years, did not expect it to break that quick.  (my older brauns still work)Little to choose really unless lifting stray hairs under your chin is important in which case go for the 9 if money is not an issue.  There was a £10 voucher when I bought this, required me to just click it and £10 was deducted of the total priceLittle difference to choose really between 7 and 9 series, they both give a good shave",4
3410,Not my usual choice but enjoyable read with a few good twists n turns,4
3411,"Not overly impressed with this blind.  The suckers randomly don't work.  At first it's because they are new and a bit stiff, but even after having used the blind a few times I find it a struggle to get them to stick to the glass.  I'd still recommend it though because despite having to work at getting it up, once it's up it is really good and a Godsend for anybody with young kids who likes to sleep later than 5am!!",4
3412,Not quite a month yet and it is falling apart already see photo.,4
3413,"Not sure all the addon bits are useful, however, it is an excellent toothbrush and worth the price.",4
3414,Not sure how much use the app really is! But it's a good robust brush. Doubt if anyone would really pay the full retail price!,4
3415,"Not sure what to think or say! Loved it cos it kept you turning the page all the way wanting to find out what happens next! But didn't expect that ending!! BUT! I supposed that is why it's called ""a gripping thriller""! ☺.Final conclusion: despite my misgivings about the ending (I read too many feel good books and happy endings!😊), it was good writing and worth the read!",4
3416,"Not usually being a fan of ""modern thrillers"", I started this book with no great expectations one way or the other; I'm pleased to say that it turned out to be a really gripping read which kept me turning pages much longer into the night than I intended to do.  It's never going to be in my top ten - the characters are a bit ""wishy-washy"" (at one point, the lead female protagonist sees herself in the future as a ""yummy mummy"", I'd already put her into this pigeon-hole anyway) and London-centric - nevertheless the story rattles along at a cracking pace and there are enough twists to the plot to surprise you and keep you insatiably curious to find out what else you can possibly have misinterpreted.  The climax is tense enough, though I though the epilogue section was a bit lacklustre, to be honest.  But worth spending your time reading the whole novel, no doubt about that.",4
3417,Not yet been used as it is a gift for my husband for Christmas but o hope it will be very good many thanks Mrs Debbie Lang .,4
3418,"Not your usual crime story.  An intricate plot, only too believable, that never lets up.  A new author in my library, and one I’ll keep an eye on.",4
3419,"now then, the idea of connecting this new toothbrush to my smart phone in order to monitor its progress and adjustability may well be a stage too far in bathroom technology. When I think back to toothbrushes I have known since my first = a Junior pink plastic with teddy bear handle and very soft brush, it seems amazing.Teeth are with us from cradle (virtually) to grave (mostly) and their treatment depends largely on ourselves and those overpriced torturers with their needles and nasty smells and horrible waiting roomsTechnology was bound to cast its piercing gaze upon this wanton branch of health and hygiene and Oral B has been in a class of its own. Practical, robust and always available.This kit comes with three heads ( interchangeable, presumably) a base and plug (adapter needed for two pin plug) a carry case (?) and a booklet with more information than I ever had for my A Level Shakespeare paper!!This tough little guy is going to grace a lot of bathrooms and as they say ""once you go Oral B ...",4
3420,"Oh the electric toothbrush, i have had 3 now and never really used any of them properly, end up using a normal brush after a week or so. Not sure why really, i think i just found there to be no difference as i take my time brushing anyway and i'm quite thorough (especially after having a tooth removed! never doing that again).My last one was decent enough although i felt like my head was rattling it was that powerful. This one however despite being powerful it was great to use. Will it take over from my regular brush? maybe!First off the brush comes with a few things like a few different brush heads, the travel case and the monitor.  Setting it all up takes seconds as there really isnt much to setup other than where you will mount the monitor.Now this brush comes with a ton of modes, my previous one had a few and i found them to be no different in results. This little fella comes with deep clean, whitening, gum care etc etc and really would you use all these modes? daily? I understand the need to keep oral health at a max but this feels a bit OTT especially if you haven't got that much time in a morning to swap between modes.The monitor that connects to the brush, is supposed to keep track of your cleaning, moving from zone to zone after a set time, you get a little face to let you know you moved to a different area. Will this be used all the time? No i doubt it, it's ok but well do you need a smiley face to let you know how well your doing? At that time in the morning i feel like punching anyone who smiles at me, let alone when im brushing my teeth.The brush also links to a smart phone so it can in effect take over the monitors job. I can see this being useful if your traveling and forget your monitor, but again i can't say i'm bowled over.In the end you have a brilliant toothbrush that cleans well and last's a while on a single charge, the monitor and bluetooth ability feel a bit wasted, but i wouldn't buy a toothbrush just for that. Your gonna get a great finish and fresh mouth after this, but make sure you use it to get your moneys worth as this isn't cheap at the time of writing this review.",4
3421,Ok book but a bit confusing at timesStrange ending and still confused.I overall enjoyed it but would have preferred a better ending,4
3422,Ok with a product not too bad but not happy paying VAT on top of the price,4
3423,"Okay, yes, there are a whole bunch of gimmicky frills here, but it is a decent product overall and does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth rather well. You get a solid kit which feels durable with four different brush heads. While it is dubious if these brush-heads perform the function they are named after, it is clear they do make a difference. There is a useful haptic feedback that let's you know if you apply too much pressure.Oral-B also grants an extra year of warranty if you register online.Frills1. Bluetooth connectivity and SmartGuide -- apart from serving as a two minute timer, not much use.2. In-built ''modes'' -- let's face it, these basically decide how fast the motor goes.3. Premium case that is anything but premium, very plasticky.4. Non-lithium ion battery -- probably not an issue so long as you don't expect the brush to outlive Parliament.",4
3424,OK👍,3
3425,"On a positive note this is a page turner that I enjoyed reading with lots of twists and turns thoughout. It is also interesting how the authoruses solar eclipses as a focus point in the novel.  I engaged with the characters and found the trial believable.However I did feel that some of the things that Laura says in the book does not reflect her character and for me stood out immensly.Laura is an intelligent girl with a good education with excellent qualifications including a Sociology degree. For example in court she refers to herself as feeling like a backward child. For me this is not something that would be said, there were other occasions where this is visible as well.It is difficult to review some issues in this book without giving the plot away but it is a well worth a read.",4
3426,On the whole a pretty enjoyable read.,4
3427,"Once I got around the idea of a toothbrush with wi-fi or even Bluetooth, (There's a joke in there somewhere), it works great. It cleans properly to my dentist's standard! Quite expensive, however, I did buy it on a Black Friday. I think this sits towards the higher end of the range. If you can get one under eighty quid go for it.",4
3428,"Once I started reading this book, I found it difficult to put down. A good read with surprising twists and turns. Very enjoyable.",4
3429,Once suction cups used a few times they stick better to window. Works well on daughters window in summer to block out light in morning ! Stops her getting up at 5am ! Easy to fold up,4
3430,"Once you get around the somewhat awkward UI its actually a solid, well performing device.Currently in use in Kenya so definitely getting a good rugged test the tablet is holding up well.Performance seems more than adequate coping with any game and HD movie I could throw at it. Expandable storage is a good addition but with ample on board storage you probably wont need it.The screen is very good for a tablet of this price with strong colours and a decent brightness. The speakers aren't so good however. Although that might not be a bad thing depending on that the kids are watching. Bluetooth or wired headphones work just fine.Battery life is average - on par with a compatible Samsung tablet.The user interface is where the Fire tablet might put some people off.Initially it will boot into a extremely bolted down UI for the kids where they can select from Amazons kids content which in fairness it plentiful and safe.You can switch to a normal ""admin"" UI quite easily once know how which will allow for editing the kids profile - content, apps, usable hours etc. This can also be done online via the Amazon website.Adding MP4 files for offline viewing is possible but a little awkward - you have to jump though a few hoops.Overall for a first tablet or just one with exceptional parental control the Fire Kids tablet is a great choice.Just take a little time to familiarise yourself with the UI and I think you'll be pleased.",4
3431,"Once you get the hang of folding between the suction pads to get the blind to fit your window, this is brilliant. Strong suction, has even survived a few assaults from lively and curious cats. Only gripe is they're quite fiddly to fold and get back into the bag.Works beautifully though, keeps the room very dark!",4
3432,"One thing I can say it really pushes you to brush your teeth, the blue tooth idea is definitely a plus",4
3433,"Only bought this 2 days ago so still learning this product,but have always had electric toothbrushes.This toothbrush cleans well however I have not worked out when 2 minute minimum cleaning time is up as my previous brush switched off.Clearly not sure how that works?Seems like good value compared to other products.",4
3434,only gave it 4 star as a few of the sticky things kept falling off so i ended up just draping it over the curtain rod instead. works well though.,4
3435,Oooooo what an interesting read and who to believe? Yes it might be a little slow for some people but I enjoyed the twisty ride and the outcome. Highly recommended.,4
3436,Oral B has been one of my favorite brands over the years and I have used many of there brushes like the 5000 series however this brush I received part of a market research trial and its a big improvement up from the predecessor no doubt but it could do a little help with the design and overall standing charge unit. So lets start with the bad things I would like to highlight to Oral B that if you are going to make a unit in black the heads must be too! I don't think the white brush heads go with the overall design and they need to consider this. Secondly the the unit to charge the device needs a upgrade in the design it is still same like it is predecessor and no thought or consideration has gone into the design phase of this unit. So i strongly recommend Oral B to invest more time and money in making things at least look more appealing.Now coming to the cleaning side of things Oral B never fails to deliver so well done to that Whitening results seen in only days and the interval times after 30 seconds is almost instant and not to forget all the cleaning modes to help you get the best results! so its faster and more powerful and I love the blue lights! The technology side of things relating to Bluetooth haven't used this much but intend to soon!Overall a 8/10 so please take my opinion in your next product launch and thank you once again!,4
3437,Ordered for my daugter and she's very pleased with it,4
3438,"Ordered this for when we go on holiday as this black out blind was recommended by a friend. I haven't used it yet but the one my friend has is very good, hence the reason i purchased.",4
3439,"Other family members have one of these so I knew what I was getting. Not as easy to adjust for window size as you might think, but is very effective at cutting out early morning light.",4
3440,"Other reviews are far more in depth than mine ever will be, but i've found this toothbrush is not as powerful as my old 2000 series - and will reduce even further if more pressure is applied. I suppose the toothbrush knows better than I!Might get a white one next time as the Black looks smart but shows up spit/toothpaste etc easily and is hard to keep clean.Excellent that it comes with multiple heads. I bought this toothbrush for £50.49 on Prime Day, absolute bargain.",4
3441,"Our bedroom is south facing and turns into a sauna in this heat, I was hoping this could help us with the late sun set and the heat. I am very pleased with the material, its very thick and definitely deflects heat from the sun. The only problem with the curtain is that the suckers only stick on a windows glass and since we have blinds fitted directly on the glass, they are of no use. This is my fault though for not thinking it through before buying but it would be nice if the item had another way to fix it onto the windows. I have now purchased a roll of a heavy duty Velcro that sticks on the window frame. I would also like if the curtain was a bit wider as it doesn't fully cover our bay windows.",4
3442,Our kindle came with no apps preloaded which was a disappointment.,4
3443,"Out of the box this is encased in a sleek hard travel case with a cord set which connects it easily to the mains. The plug is two pin so needs a 2 pin adapter to plug it in for charging. Once charged it is ready to go. This is a great design from Braun. It is ergonomic, smooth and easy to use. This model 9040s has a dry and wet function. This is the only model that can be used with a foam or gel, soThe shaving is smooth and comfortable.You have to hold the shaver at right angles to the skin for best results. The technology behind this efficiency is the so called ‘synchro sonic technology’, which delivers 40,000 cross cutting action per minute for an outstanding thorough shave and amazing comfort. It has a multi head lock with 5 adjustable angles for a precise shave; and a precision trimmer for trimming moustache and sideburns, this we have not bordered to use.There is a small comb like brush included in the pack for cleaning. However it can also be cleaned under running tap.The battery is rechargeable Li-ion battery and this charges very quickly. Once charged it can be used as cordless for up to 50mins. The shaver can be used with the cord on when it is out of charge but not for the models that have wet and dry shave- 9040s and the 9095cc, and rightly so to avoid accidents.The LED display indicates the battery status, the travel lock status and the hygiene status. The cleaning is fairly straight forward. One of the most important features is the travel lock which prevents unintended start up. The instruction manual is in several languages - German, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,Nederland, Danish(dansk),Norwegian (Norsk), Swedish (Svenska),Finnish (Suomi), Turkish, Russian etc. On the whole this is a great multi headed electric shaver, but if bit pricey.",4
3444,"Over the years I have had many electric razors including Remington, Philips and Braun. They each have their good points  I had three Philips in a row  because they were light with a very good trimmer for sideburns and a reasonable shave.  They  were especially very useful for holidays,  However, I had occasion recently to use an old Braun and was surprised to find it gave an excellent shave compared with the more recent ""other brands"".  And then on Christmas I was given a Braun 9 series.  This gives the best shave ever and can last 24 hrs instead of stubble  emerging on the same day.  This is now my favourite razor!  But it is not perfect.  Overall it is sturdy and solid.  It gives the best shave after trying the others.  But the trimmer is flimsy and does not cut longer, stray hairs as well as the Philips trimmer.  If Braun had been as good, I would have given five stars. Nevertheless, a close shave is what I am after and from my experience, Braun is best.In response to an enquiry 6 months later, I suggested that the enquirer should contact his merchant or Braun for warranty issues or the purchase of spare or replacement parts",4
3445,"Over the years I've tried various electric shavers and was never happy with them for one reason or another.  This one has surprised me in that I have not yet wet shaved (proper shave!) once since it arrived.  I used to use the latest Gillette blades which are excellent and give a very close shave and never 'nik' etc.  This is certainly not as close a shave, but for an electric shaver its very good, and of course the hair grows as soon as you cut it anyway!  Its also very easy to clean - run whilst under hot water and you get a technique that doesn't take long and just works.  I'm not someone with a huge enough bathroom to have space for cleaning units - it goes in the drawer when I've finished with it!The main reason for only 4 stars is cost.  I have no problem with the noise as others have mentioned, but it could also be more compact.  It also looks a bit old fashioned to my eye, but hey its only a shaver :)",4
3446,"Overall a good read, a bit slow in places but it's definitely worth persevering with for the twist at the end. I did not see it coming and it casts the whole book in a different light. Not my usual style of book but I would recommend it.",4
3447,"overall an amazing product, perfect for kids young and old. however it is let down with its two year no worry no questions guarantee. If it does break it is a nightmare to get it replaced through customer services as they are not able to put a like for like replacement through and you will get something worth half the purchase price that has been refurbished. After speaking to six different people and having to explain myself on each occasion I  had money credited to a gift card so I could purchase a replacement myself. An absolute joke of a guarantee",4
3448,Overall good but takes more than 3 hours for full charge.,4
3449,Parallel stories blend in this very different style of storyline. The format narrows down to quite a relatively sudden crescendo!,4
3450,"Perfect to help the baby sleep, my only frustration was that one of the sucker cups didn’t work that well! Still a great product and I’ve got one permanently in my child’s room now",4
3451,Perleys whites looking great,4
3452,Pleased with the product and the service. The wire on the earring I find to be a bit long.,4
3453,"Plenty of cheaper rechargeable toothbrushes available, however this one is fully loaded. Use the supplied lcd display and/or the app on your mobile to guide and track your brushing activities, helping you stay on the good side of your dentist.",4
3454,"Practical, but a bit wobbly.",4
3455,Preety good stuff,4
3456,Present,4
3457,Present for my wife. She loved them.,4
3458,Present so can't comment sorry.,4
3459,Present.,4
3460,Pretty !,4
3461,Pretty good,4
3462,Pretty good.,4
3463,Pretty good. Blocks out most light. Blocks out heat too which is an added bonus. Suction cups sometimes need a little encouragement to stick. Lovely pattern design.,4
3464,"Pretty good. Definitely keeps out the light.... but just depends how taught the Gro blind material can be between each suction cup i.e using the handy Velcro pleats to reduce the blinds overall size, does then allow each pleated area to allow small amounts of light through around the edge.",4
3465,"Pretty impressed with its cleaning performance, reasonable battery life, range of included heads and accessories and the clever (if a little gimmicky) Bluetooth timer (which at least does encourage you to brush for at least two minutes... two and a half if you want five stars and a wink from the digital smiley face).But if I'm to be honest, as an electric toothbrush, it doesn't actually perform any better than Oral-B's regular and much cheaper 'two-minute-timer-same-brush-compatible' models. I also feel that the various brushing modes available would be more useful if they were - or could be made to be - a part of a 'brushing program'... so that it would do the 'teeth timing' first and then maybe the 'tongue cleaning' mode after... rather than having to manually switch between them. And whilst the included timer has never lost its link to the toothbrush, I found the connectivity to my phone or my tablet was not that reliable. Besides, the novelty of being able to see your brushing habits (which are pretty much the same everyday anyway) soon wears off.Despite all that, I like it... and would likely buy another if this one died... but unless you really want these features or it's available on a really good 'Black Cyber Wednesday' deal, save the cash and get one of their less feature-rich but just as efficient-cleaning ones.",4
3466,"pretty little earrings, quite dainty.  only draw back is to remember to take them out as i don't think they would survive the night.",4
3467,Pretty!,4
3468,"Product is sturdy and durable, Holds just about any phone and its phone case because the arms extend quite a bit and that is a pretty big plus. It takes a second to figure out how the back end works to put it in and it works with any car's air vent. The only disadvantage to this product is the mount which comes off easily, it's always best to double-check whether it s firmly in place so that it doesn't fall off when you take or put your phone in it.It does not take much air vent space however it is noticeable when the AC is on that the flow is less significant, however that is obviously expected. The product came on time and it looks and does as advertised.",4
3469,product was good but didn't suit me.,4
3470,"Pros: Brilliant cleaning, easily compares to my usual Sonicare, feels like I've just returned from the hygienist after each brushing. Haven't really noticed any whitening effect, other than effectively removing staining due to tannins and wine at tooth margins, which it does do extremely effectively. The 2-min timer has been particularly effective for the kids, to ensure that brushing is effective, and for sufficient time. The brush heads are small, and so it's easy to reach all areas of the mouth, even for children.Cons: The brush is much noisier than my old Sonicare, but pretty comparable to other electric brushes (I get up before the rest of the household so this can be an issue). We don't have a charge point in the bathroom, so the brush is not constantly on charge and, even new, it only lasts a few days (probably due to the 'landing strip' of blue lights & bluetooth coming on. I also had to find a 'French to English' adapter to charge at a normal socket. I much prefer the design of my old sonic, with batteries in the handle.Meh: Didn't really see the point of the app, I'm not that obsessed with my oral health.Overall, the amazing performance would make it worth the money (though I got a free tester), and I would buy a replacement, or upgrade to a quieter model if one was available!",4
3471,Purchase good,4
3472,Purchased as a gift.,4
3473,Purchased for my downs syndrome son.its very user freindley and hard to damage with the kids surround.good screen quality.Obviousley not as many options as dearer tablets,4
3474,Purchased this black out blind as it was on sale compared to other sites and places I have viewed.Used for my 3 year old boy as soon as there is light coming through he's awake. First morning of using this blackout blind he woke up slightly later.Very happy with product and I would defiantly recommend!The only down thing about this product is the suction caps stick when they want to stick.Otherwise this blind is very big and adjustable.,4
3475,Quality of camera and lack of 3G/4G is considerable downside... other than that it is quite nice and my daughter liked it too.,4
3476,Quality yet again,4
3477,"Quick delivery, charged to 70% when taken from packaging, so keen 9yr daughter ready to use straight away.  Loving the cover, easy and fast to download great app's, books etc. Has been good to start some revision on maths, reading, spelling prior to going back to school.  Loving all the settings you are able to use to control time spent ( however, daughter good at putting electronics down to play with other toys, so have not needed to use).  So far so good, only had for a week so hence 4 stars and always room for improvement.  But GREAT tablet, thoroughly recommend.  Will be curious to see in a year the cost of update and payment for app's etc.",4
3478,Quick delivery. As said in description.,4
3479,"Quite a good read, kept me interested bit of a silly ending.",4
3480,Quite a gripping story with a twist in the tale or tail!!,4
3481,Quite a gripping story with a twist.,4
3482,Quite a twist at the end of a story that kept going between two people at two different dates.  Quite enjoyed it.,4
3483,"Quite an expense this one but it sticks to the window and blacks out the evening sun which is now causing my 3 yr old to question bed time!Of course it's not perfect, but I didn't expect perfection.  It sticks to the window, is still stuck there in the morning and we can tae it with us on holiday.  Couldn't ask for more really!",4
3484,Quite edge of seat in parts.,4
3485,Quite interesting,4
3486,"Quite robust, but a little gimmicky. If programming it can not only time the teeth brushing into mouth quarters, ie. 2 mins whole mouth, therefore 30 seconds on each quarter. You can also choose type of brushing, and use the appropriate brush head, Ie. general clean, deep clean etc.,",4
3487,"Quite satisfied with purchase. Fishhooks a tad flimsy and short but, with care in fitting, they look the part. Recipient liked them overall.",4
3488,Quite small but very nice,4
3489,Quite sturdy for a clip holder and easy to site/remove phone - good value,4
3490,Read for book club. Rated seven out of ten,4
3491,"Read it in one night, couldn't put it down.  Very good thriller with unbelievable twist that keeps you in suspense.",4
3492,Realistic police procedural read which I enjoy,4
3493,Really enjoyed the pace and build up of this thriller. Characters are great. A few unexpected twists with a realistic ending. Would recommend.,4
3494,Really enjoyed the solar eclipse aspect of this novel & the unwrapping of the relationships between the characters. It held my attention - the `single white female` type thriller.Passions run deep. Secrets are withheld. Loyalty is tested.Had to keep turning pages!! Un-put-downable!,4
3495,Really enjoyed this book so many twists & turns never would have guessed the ending !!,4
3496,"Really enjoyed this book. Great pace, clever and engaging plot, nice and tight (focuses on four main characters) and well written. Bit far fetched in the end but I can forgive that (aren't they all in any case). Would recommend.",4
3497,Really enjoyed this story,4
3498,Really enjoyed this. but found the time=lines confusing at times. I understand why it had to end as it did but I was really hoping for a happy ending,4
3499,"Really enjoyed this. I'm not one for ""twists"" in books as they're usually predictable but this had me guessing. A great read.",4
3500,Really good although battery doesn't last as long as i hoped,4
3501,Really good and has been taken to lots of locations and blacks out well. It would be good of this in incorporated Velcro tabs so you had the option to stick directly to the frame.,4
3502,"Really good at blocking the light out, but the suction pads are a bit hit and miss and don’t always stick.",4
3503,Really good brilliant for kids mine love it,4
3504,Really good electric toothbrush! Bought this after seeing the hygienist who recommended an electric toothbrush! Definitely 100 times better than a manual toothbrush! Cleans thoroughly with various settings. Good value for money!,4
3505,Really good for kids. My son loves it,4
3506,Really good tablet but went on offer day after I ordered so Would of been even better to save £30!!,4
3507,"Really Good Toothbrush with loads of features.I previously used a sonicare toothbrush and loved it. When I first moved to the Oral-B brand I struggled as dis not get in well with the smaller circular head. I persevered but I still didn't get on well with it. The problem I have is with the head itself so I plan to get the larger head that is simular to my previous brand and I think this will resolve all the issues I have with the brush.So as I currently cannot use the brush my children are (with their suitable heads of course!) and they love it.It has so many features:The wall mounted timer is brilliant, as they both tend to brush their teeth together it allows the child not holding the unit to know when to change sides.Personalised features, you can choose cleaning mode to either whiten your teeth, make the brush aware that your teeth are sensitive r deep clean. There is even an option to clean your tongue!Download the Oral-B app and it links to your smartphone or iPad to track your achievements. I couldn't find this through my tablet so gave to google the app to locate it.There is a sensor to tell you if you are brushing too hard, I have not personally set this off but as everything else works fine I presume this does too.The only bad point I can see with this toothbrush is to get your achievements logged is if you link the brush each time you clean your teeth. This means you need to bring your tablet or smartphone into the bathroom each time you clean your teeth, which is a total pain!",4
3508,Really good toothbrush!!! your teeth feel really clean and I love the fact it alerts you if you brush too hard! Comes with 6 different modes of cleaning with corresponding brush heads. One downfall which relates to the design the button for turning on/off and the button for changing type of cleaning could do with being the opposite way around.Did take longer time to charge initially (longer than suggested in instructions) and I haven't downloaded the App (not sure why you need an app for a toothbrush!).,4
3509,"really great idea, the cups could be better",4
3510,"Really great product, easy to put up and adjust to window size, and blocks out all the light. Two minor criticisms: I've been using in recently in hot weather but fabric isn't very breathable so it doesn't allow air to circulate from the open window behind it. Unfortunately I think that's unavoidable with good blackout material. The other criticism is when using it for more than a couple of nights I've found I've had to take it down completely each morning then put it back up in the evening as there isn't a blind mechanism to hold it up during the day.",4
3511,Really gripping,4
3512,"Really handy, so easy to put up and does a good job in keeping the light out",4
3513,"Really like this pump, although it isn't as fast as others I have used its still a very good pump. I particularly like the silicone part as it means you get a good airtight seal. Closed system and really easy to clean.",4
3514,Really liked these. Just a bit of bling but they are nice and do sparkle and are a nice length.,4
3515,"Really liked this book.  Well written, original background to the story, lovely twist in the tail.  And it's the Ladder just off Green Lanes in Haringey, which is  bit like home to me.  Definitely worth reading.",4
3516,Really please with this. Bought it to replace and ageing and cracked screen iPad my 2yr old was using. It losses 1 star as the screen could be brighter and improved vibrancy (compared to the iPad). However I really think the parental control and variety of pre-loaded vid/apps more than makes up for it.I also enjoyed watching a film on it.It appears really robust and my 2yr old hasn't once asked for the old iPad back!,4
3517,"Really powerful shaver - ploughs through stubble on my face or head like an absolute beast. It gives a smooth, close and comfortable shave. Comes in a well protected, although slightly bulky travel pouch along with a charging cord and small cleaning brush. Dead easy to clean - just pop the top off. While you can use it wet or rinse under the tap, I've not needed to.Only one unusual thing I noticed, which was that it seems to ""eject"" the hair it's shaving off as you angle it to save the sides of your face (or top of head). Downside is it's a bit messy, upside is cleaning it is even easier. Personally it doesn't bother me as I the mirror I shave in front of is over the sink, so the hair just gets rinsed down the plughole.All in all, an excellent shaver that does what it's supposed to very well.",4
3518,Really pretty. Good value for money. Quick delivery.,4
3519,"Really really darkens the room, made a world of difference. Still get bits of light in at the sides as we move it about a lot (grandparents etc) but if we took the time to fit perf3ctly, expect it would provide total darkness.",4
3520,Really thought provoking. The way it ois written enables the reader to get to know the characters well,4
3521,"Really useful product! Folds up really small, I can take this anywhere and it comes in a bag. Various uses- holidays, overnight stays, summer nights. Much cheaper than a black out blind and can be transported anywhere! Decent size, have always been able to fully cover windows wherever I have used it. Blacks out light really well even though it is not thick. Does not always stick however, but can be propped up so this wasn't a problem. Great product!",4
3522,Received. Thank you,4
3523,Recommend by a Dentist after an appointment - purchased one for myself and partner.Good product!,4
3524,"Remember the days when toothbrushes were little wooden sticks with bristles stuck on?  Ah - nostalgia!!With this toothbrush I'd really like to think we've come as far as we can get.  I'm unsure what the next step could possibly be - an ai talking toothbrush calmly advising you to flick gently to the left (in an American accent?)? A robot simply saying ""open wide""?Well, this toothbrush will look at a weeks worth of brushing and let you know (via app) that you skipped last Friday but brushed four times on Saturday.  It has half a dozen different modes, tells you when you're brushing too hard or too much and a great many other things.If you like gadgets you'll love this - and I must admit that its kind of fun - but even for those with no memory of anything other than an electronic world,  I really can't see any reason for this brush.After all, my mum (who's 90 years old) uses a bit of wood (well, plastic) with bristles stuck on and she has all her own teeth.",4
3525,Replacement for another type of electric toothbrush. This has far superior cleaning power.,4
3526,Replacing on I bought 2 years ago that died...,4
3527,"Review  written after a number of weeks of use.What I like: solid product; quick charge; great cleaning and fan dry from cleaning station; shaves close but with some issues.What I don't like: plastic body of shaver feels cheap given the high price of this item; feels insecure when placed in charging stand; inability to control speed of shaver for sensitive areas; large head makes shaving some areas a challenge.Best performance: prepare your skin with some pre-shave lotion so as to reduce burning sensation created by this high speed shaver.Improvements: stronger material for body maybe with some lovely chrome; ability to slow down speed of shaver, it really does burn some areas; magnetic clip in to charging stand so more secure.",4
3528,Review added to replacement brush box by mistake.,4
3529,"ReviewBeing in the military, I need to have a close shave every day and have only wet shaved for decades. However, I do tend to get a rash on my neck line so I thought it would be good to try this shaver out and see if it alleviated the problem. First of all, it is a very swept up bit of kit with the cleaning module ensuring a clean razor every morning. The intelligent cleaning and charging is fantastic, quick and carefree. However, I did find that I spent longer trying to get a close enough shave than with a disposable razor and I was therefore far quicker wet shaving. I also needed to go over my face afterwards to get any bits the Braun just refused to reach. Overall I would say for normal one day stubble and daily use this shaver is a great option, although any more than a days stubble and it falls a little short. ",4
3530,"Riveting and surprising. Well written and I liked the way it jumped around the timeframes, but easy to follow this with the date line on every chapter heading, very quirky with the eclipse theme running through it.  However, at the end,  the first chapter of the recommended book, The Poison Tree, is not actually that book. Perhaps this could be amended.",4
3531,Robust and easy to use. A bit to gimmicky for my taste.,4
3532,Secure and sturdy holder it's just a shame it wouldn't fit my car vent!,4
3533,"Seems to fit perfectly well on my car vents but does now and again fall off, which is a bit irritating! After receiving an email from the seller they have been more than helpful with the issues that I have had. Thank you!",4
3534,Sent back husband had already bought one,4
3535,"Set against the natural phenomena of various eclipses this was one of those books you go into thinking it's about one thing but then ends up being something else.  You know with the title and the first few chapters what you think it'll be but that's where it ends.As a female reader my natural and first instinct was to believe the 'she said' but as I read on, and only by my own interpretation and prediction (not what I read), I thought we were heading down the road of hang on a minute, what if she's lying and I shouldn't be giving her the benefit of the doubt.  As regular readers will know, I'm crap at predicting what's coming and needless to say it was no different in this case ;)I thought this book was brilliantly written although somewhat slow in places that I wanted it all to move on a little quicker but I couldn't fault the drama, the tension and all the twisty bits down to the last sentence and I didn't have a clue what was coming (coz I'm rubbish!).",4
3536,"She loves it,And YouTube can't be downloaded on to it.",4
3537,Simple and completely effective. I would recommend,4
3538,Simple and great,4
3539,"Simple, sturdy and actually works",4
3540,Slightly smaller than I thought - I saw no dimensions on seller page but item is acceptable.,4
3541,Slow burner,4

3545,"Slow to start, but halfway through it starts to come together (making you realise why it seemed slow) with a good ending.",4
3546,Small and dainty earrings.  Plastic cube to secure them is fairly difficult to slide on.  Reasonable purchase price.  Very unreasonable postage!,4
3547,"Small, but work good",4
3548,Smaller than expected but nice enough,4
3549,Smaller than expected but still nice. Very delicate.,4
3550,"smaller than expected, but very pretty, would buy again",4
3551,"Smooth shaving. The foils are very smooth and safe for the skin. Wet and dry shaving, so can be rinsed to clean. The cleaning liquid (and charging unit) also disinfects the shaver.",4
3552,"So easy to use and very effective.  I rent and didn't want to spend too much on curtains or blinds and I'm far too lazy for any diy, so this product is a reasonably priced easy solution.  Its also well made and looks like it will last me a good few years.",4
3553,So far no problems.  Shave feels closer than my previous series 7 model.,4
3554,"So far really liking this, switched from a manual to this - unsure how the clock is to be set, but the bluetooth with app is really handy! Definitely giving me a better clean! Thanks!",4
3555,"So far so good, first time buy and not much to say about this product.",4

3557,"So glad I got this kit and would definitely recommend it, 5*...",4
3558,"So I needed a new electric toothbrush, and considering we're well into the second decade of the 21st century, decided it was time to move up to a Smart Toothbrush.Plus points - and if you're a geek - I'll make it the starting point.  Yes - there is a Companion App for your smartphone!!!It's fairly good - records your time, progress, graphs and records other data as well.  Also keeps track over time and in true App fashion - provides you little Awards for accomplishments like 'consistency' etc.  Yes, it's a bit over the top, but it does serve the purpose and keeps you focussed.  The other parts of the app - showing you real time progresses of where you should be focussing your brushing at any given second is really, really helpful and has in all honesty pushed me towards a much more consistent teeth cleaning regimen.  Other features of the App/Brush combo include being able to set profiles, and things to focus on - which again is good.  I like it.  Practically speaking, it's a *lot* easier to use with the App.Synching with Bluetooth has not been a problem.  Ever.  And I've been using it now for around 6 weeks.(Should you not have a smartphone, or not wish to use a smartphone - then its still entirely possible to use all the features, it just takes a little longer.)Other plus points - it comes with 4 different brush heads, and has multiple speed/pattern settings with let you set up exactly the kind of clean that you require.Conclusion: Does a kick ass teeth cleaning job.About the only negative point I have, and I see others have also noted this - the battery life is not stellar.  I'm having to pop it to the charger every two or three days.  I get that its a battery intensive device, but I think the battery needs a little more staying power to be a true winner.  Braun -  fix this.For features and general 21st century coolness - 8/10For general teeth cleaning capability - 8.5/10.For the App - 8/10 (its not a bad App)For the battery life - 6.5/10.Overall rating: 7.75/10.(For reference - I used to use an old Colgate electric - no problems ever with it - you pushed the button, it cleaned your teeth.  I simply stopped using it because I lost the !@£$%^&* charger and couldn't buy a new one...)",4
3559,So many twists & turns made this difficult to put down - each of the main characters had demons to address - no-one was blameless but the final twist made me  feel uncomfortable with the outcome. Still an excellent tale,4
3560,"So many twists and turns , didn't guess most of them, definitely worth a read ,hard to put down at times",4
3561,"So simple to set up. My 8 year old loves it. Only issue I find is that the kids profile layout is chaotic. It would be better if there was a separation between what had been downloaded and what could be downloaded. Apologies if there is already, but I haven't figured out how to do it.My son's issue is that the games don't load even after dowload if it's not connected to the internet.",4
3562,"So what makes a good psychological thriller? Ask Erin Kelly, because she has all the right ingredients in her latest book He Said/She Said. For the last few days I have been sucked into a fascinating story with so many twists and turns that have been woven together in such a skillful way. I feel that I know the characters and the tension builds until it was difficult to stop reading. And I was not left disappointed when I finally reached the last page, which can happen so often when reading books in this genre.But don't take my word for it, get yourself a copy now.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4
3563,"So, as a family who have slowly converted over to Apple for pretty much everything, we were a little torn as to what to buy our 3yr old when looking at something to entertain him on a long journey to France over xmas. The cost was a factor and although we initially though IPAD, we looked into it further. This has a great rubberised bumper cover on so even a drop on a concrete floor does not phase it, and it comes with a no quibble replacement warranty from Amazon which has got to be worth something in the hands of a 3yr old! The downside for me is the ease of use. If you’ve had a Kindle before then you might find it easy, but this is why I dropped one star. Yes, the apps etc are pretty vast and the biggest plus is that little one can't wander off and be found attempting to log into your bank or buying something on Ebay! This comes at a cost though. You have to have one profile for the adult, and one for the child which means constantly logging in from one to the other. My son loves YOUTube kids...could we find this? Ended up on forums and ‘how to’ websites to work out how to download it. Eventually found it was only available on the adults profile page, which kind of defeats the object. I have PRIME anyway, so there were plenty of videos, games etc available for free and we downloaded some beforehand so he could watch them offline. It connects easily when tethering your phone as a hotspot, a bonus when out and about. Overall, Id still choose this over an Ipad, i’m not stressing when hes carrying it around and was a lot cheaper, but I dont think Ive unlocked its full potential yet.",4
3564,Some of the twists were a bit predictable but all in all gripping enough. A great commute read.,4
3565,Some problems with sticers,4
3566,Some suckers stick well; other suckers do not.  So I found it necessary to leave it a few minutes and adjust in order to get it to stick effectively enough to block out the light.,4
3567,Soooo nice for kids I love it,4
3568,still getting the hang of using an electric toothbrush but does clean very nicely,4

3576,"Takes  a couple attempts to stick the suction caps on, but once they are on no light comes through this blind! Best. Thing.ever for my super fussy toddler.",4
3577,takes a few chapters to get into the characters but after that the story never fails to surprise. A good read that keeps u guessing,4
3578,Takes all day and all night to charge fully from 1 bar of battery good brush thou,4
3579,Takes some getting used to if you used any other tablet or smart phone. You can't preview apps they just download and search doesn't work like you would expect but so far the boys love it. Has lots of free education apps and books. Great for my yr1 boy,4
3580,Tense and gripping. Have no interest in eclipses so found the descriptions boring,4
3581,"Terrific brush - as all but the bottom of the range Oral Bs are. It's nice and lightweight, good to grip, feels solid and cleans very well. The various brushes (tongue cleaner anyone?) are great, although I prefer just choosing a brush I like and sticking with it. The extras and gadgets - well, they took a lot of reading and studying, but ultimately, I binned them. Bluetooth? A device that mimics what the brush timer does but also knows what brush you're using? A plastic wardrobe for your other brushes? All a bit OTT. Great brush, but they're struggling to find novel ways of adding value. The obvious one would be battery life - does it really take a whole day and a night to charge a battery these days?!",4
3582,Terrifying and compelling novel - fast pace and kept me guessing throughout! Really good.,4
3583,Thank God I did not pay the full price.  Other than the gizmos it is no better than the 2000 which I use for travelling,4

3589,"The best and easiest shave that I have ever had from an electric razer. I often have long stubble to deal with and this razor disposes of it effortlessly. At the same time hair is cut very close, if the razer is used correctly. At least as good as result as a quick wet shave.The shiny silver plastice casing, I don't like. A matter of personal taste perhaps, but one which could have been avoided.The very high price is hard to ignore, but if you think about what it will cost you per day over the lifetime of the razor,  it is affordable.Overall======The best electric shaver  available, if you don't mind the bling.",4
3590,The best electric shave I have had.  A big step up from the series 3 I used before.,4
3591,"The best oral b toothbrush I have purchased and I have jad them for years.  It does leave your teeth as clean as the dentist and gets into nooks and cranny's. My only gripe is the bluetooth light, annoying!!!",4
3592,"The best tablet I've bought so far. Didn't think anyone could beat the nabbi! Only downside is I buy or unlock Apps for kids and they can only be used in adult mode. Apps cost more than Google play and the YouTube kids on Amazon app store is not worth downloading, nowhere near as good as Google's version .Still giving 4 stars as it's so durable and easy to use for kids.",4
3593,"The blind itself is excellent, blocks light as advertised. However, as many reviews say the suckers aren't great. I bought some small Velcro stickers and stuck them on the window frame and attach it that way. Keeps room really dark which will be great as lighter nights approach.",4
3594,"The blind stuck well to our window and I haven't experienced any problems with the suction so far.  I was able to easily fold the blind back up to fit into the bag. I think for smaller windows, folding the blind might let a bit of light in but we haven't had to do this so I probably shouldn't comment on that. It is certainly a temporary or occasion solution and if you are looking for something more aesetically pleasing then a more substantial made to measure blind would be better.",4
3595,The bluetooth function still isnt working however i did get this on sale(black friday) so cant complain too much!,4
3596,"The Braun Oral B 6000 is billed as a professional quality rechargeable toothbrush and comes with a plethora of accessories designed to improve your brushing experience. Along with 4 different cleaning heads there is also a handy travel case, and external monitor which times your brushing session, and a two pin recharging stand for us with bathroom two pin shaver outlets. It's also Bluetooth compatible and a downloadable app receives info about your brushing.It has six brush modes ranging from standard daily clean to tongue cleaning. I don't notice a huge amount of difference between the modes but they all seem to do a good job of leaving your mouth feeling fresh and clean. The charging process is straightforward and a couple of hours gives you a substantial amount of brush time. I've had it a few weeks and only had to recharge once. The heads supplied all seem to do a good job of getting into the nooks and crannies although I find the handle itself a little bulky.While brushing,  a light on the grip will flash red let you know if you're putting on too much  pressure and the wall mounted monitor will count down the remaining brush time and let you know when it's time to move to a new part of the mouth. In other brushes I've had this countdown was achieved by a pause every thirty seconds and cut off at two minutes and although its ok having an external visualisation.I think I prefer a system that doesn't require a separate battery driven device to accomplish this.I struggled a little to find a reason for the Bluetooth function and app but I guess it would be quite handy for parents looking to monitor the brushing habits of their kids and ensuring they were doing the job properly but for me I think it's probably a function too far.All in all this is very good brush. Well made, it does the job well  and with a host of features to sate the needs of gadget heads but, if I'm honest, it costs more than I'd ever be comfortable paying for a brush and the extras don't justify such a high price.",4
3597,"The Braun Series 9 9095CC looks and feels very high-end – it’s a good weight, with nice styling. You definitely get the impression when you’re using this that it’s a premium piece of kit.In terms of shaving performance it’s by far the best electric shaver I’ve ever used – and I’ve used a good few over the years, from different brands. It is as close to a wet shave result as possible, almost imperceptibly so. To have this performance from an electric shaver, without the hassle and mess of a wet shave, is a great time saver. The powerful and large shaver head can be fixed into position or left flexible to move around the contours of your face, either way it feels effortless across the skin. I do suffer from sensitive skin and as a result had previously limited my shaving to at most twice a week to avoid irritation – that’s with the latest and greatest wet shave razors/gels/oils as well. That’s no longer the case with this shaver, a daily shave is possible without any irritation or razor burn whatsoever. In short, I couldn’t be more impressed with the quality of the shave.Other things to note…It’s a breeze to clean. Whether running it under the tap or giving it a once over with the brush, it literally takes ten seconds to get the shaver totally clean after shaving.In terms of charging, it’s impressively quick – a 50 minute charge will deliver around the same duration of shaving, which for me equates to about a week of usage. So it’s not laboriously energy sapping.It comes with a really high quality leather travel/storage case. I wouldn’t normally be taken with such an accessory, but this one is so well-designed it deserves credit. Again, it all adds up to this shaver feeling like the expensive luxury item that it is.Now for the downsides…The detail/edging trimmer, which is neatly accessed by sliding up from the middle of the shaver, falls short on a couple of areas. It’s slightly too narrow, meaning that it’s tricky to evenly trim all but the smallest areas of the face. It’s also badly positioned to clearly see where it’s cutting, the bulk of the shaver head covering the view of the trimmer blades, removing any sense of “precision” as you literally can’t see what you’re doing. Pretty much every other detail trimmer I’ve used – mainly on real budget clipper sets like the Remington Barba, it has to be said – considerably outperform this one. Disappointing on a such an otherwise well-designed shaver.The cleaning station is in principle a handy addition, but in practice there are some issues. For a start it’s massive, and will take up a good bit of room wherever you choose to store it. The design isn’t in keeping with the chrome-styled shaver, and it looks quite obtrusive. The cartridge – filled with an alcohol-based cleaning liquid – lasts between three and eight weeks depending on how regularly you use it, after which a replacement is required. One of the benefits of using an electric shaver, for me, is avoiding the expensive hamster-wheel of buying gel/foam and blades when wet shaving. I don’t want to be locked into another expense. Looks aside, the performance is first-rate, if unnecessarily excessive – the fact the shaver is fan-dried underlines just how OTT the cleaning station is. My main issue is that it’s not that difficult to effectively clean the shaver without such a complex bit of kit. The wet+dry capabilities mean it can be safely rinsed under the tap, and if you’re shaving dry then simply removing the foil, tapping it into the sink and quickly going over the blades with the supplied brush will have it as good as new. Does it need a hugely complicated (and huge) docking station for cleaning? Well, no. It’s certainly not something that I’d have thought was even an option if it wasn’t bundled with this shaver.So, one star very reluctantly knocked off for these two niggles, but overall this is an absolutely amazing choice. Purely looking at the core performance of the shaver, which the vast majority of buyers will be interested in, it’s simply outstanding.",4
3598,"The Braun series 9 comprises a number of similar looking shavers, with a slightly differing specification for each.  The 9040 is currently the lowest priced model in the series, although it still comes at a substantial cost for what is effectively a shaver with various attachments.The unit itself is quite large, but does fit well in the hand with some non-slip material to the sides to aid grip, especially in the wet.The technology is called intelligent SyncroSonic, which gives With 40,000 cross cutting actions powered by `Sonic micro-vibrations to remove more hair than any other shaver'.For me no shaver is intelligent, it's simply a tool which does a job efficiently or otherwise. This model though has some essential qualities which suit my purpose. It's cordless, with a good working life of 50 minutes on a full one hour charge. It can be used in wet conditions, with shaving foam and is fully waterproof. The  four cutting heads I found worked well, with a close cut which was satisfactory, although no better than a good wet shave. I found the use of foam/gel tended to improve the shave slightly, but at the same time felt that perhaps all I needed to do was have a quick wet shave.The shaver comes with precision trimmer for moustache/sideburns and a travel pouch to keep things tidy.It does the job, but at a price.",4
3599,The brush itself is fine but there's no point to the gimmicky display that comes with it. I've owned electric toothbrushes before and they all take an age to charge; this one seems slower though - over 24 hours - which is a concern for longevity of the device. How on earth the manufacturer can justify a price of 75 quid is a mystery.,4
3600,"The child-friendly aspect is nice although it's awkward when viewing peppa pig videos (for example) as you can't see the names of the episodes, just the numbers, so unless you have a good memory...You can swap profiles from the lock screen in order to do more advanced procedures with the regular profile and leave just the simple stuff for the children's profile.Easy for a child to select videos etc, although the UI on the video player is very obtrusive, but thankfully it can be hidden/shown by just tapping the screen, although I would prefer it if it didn't come on as soon as the video starts.It feels fairly pretty robust with the case although not sure how tough the screen itself is, hopefully it will last.",4
3601,"The delivery arrived when it was supposed to. Didn't include an adapter plug but didn't really expect it to. The Bluetooth screen doesn't seem to work properly, keeps flashing different images and things but it isn't a problem as I have the app on my phone which does the job so I haven't complained about it to the seller. Teeth have never felt so good or been so white. Cant go wrong with oral B and I have no complaints about the seller at all.",4
3602,"The device itself perfectly held my iPhone 6s Plus. The one issue I had was that I felt the vents in my car (BMW) weren't suitable enough to hold the device while it was in the Mpow holder. The weight of the phone and the slim design of the claw on the holder meant the entire mount slipped and never seemed to hold firmly. However after gifting the device to someone with the same phone but different car (Audi) they have had no issues and remains stable. It even stretches far enough to cover the case which saves the hassle of removing the case of the phone just to mount it every time. Great device, just doesn't seem to be appropriate for all car vents.",4
3603,"The display is a useful gimmick, the toothbrush more excellent than the average Oral-B, but be warned, the battery life is rather short, lasting only about a week or so between charges with no warning of running low before cutting out!",4
3604,The earring are nice and delivery was good just 2 days,4
3605,the earrings are much smaller then I expected but they are nice and look good,4
3606,The eclipse theme made an  interesting back story for a novel tale about deception and morality with a gripping  conclusion. Who'd want to be a witness after reading this?,4
3607,"The ergonomics of the Braun Oral B brushes are generally very good. The Smart 6 doesn't move away from that; it has a single power button and a function switch button. The kit I received included a 3 heads; the excellent cross head, a whitening head and a sensitive head. The Cross head brush is for me the best brush for my teeth. The whitening brush has a rubber cap in the centre and works with the whitening mode on the brush to get you whiter teeth quicker. There are several modes that vary the speed of the brush heads rotation and pulsation to reduce the impact on your gums, or work with the whitening toothbrush head for whiter teeth.  Also inside the box was a sturdy plastic case; this doesn't have any charging ability; if you require that you will need to get one of the more expensive models. Which brings me onto battery life; I reviewed the high end Braun 9000 series electric toothbrush last year. My main criticism was that the battery life was poor. The Smart 6 proudly totes that it now has a lithium battery; but somehow it still doesn't last one person much more than a week of twice a day brushing. Then you need to leave it overnight to recharge. I accept there is a motor draining the power but the battery life isn't enough to take a two week holiday without taking the power adaptor. I have really dragged out writing the review; and even drained the battery a few times to test it through. The battery lasts about 24 minutes; which with my 3 minute cycles is about 5-6 days.In terms of features; the Braun when you get past the entry level models have similar functions - the differences are how you control them, the accessories and bluetooth. As I noted before the smart 6 has the separate control button which makes switching modes simple. The smart 6 also has bluetooth and so you can connect to your phone to monitor your brushing, It works in that it logs you have brushed your teeth; and despite dentists being proved wrong on the benefits of flossing it still suggests you do so, II have smart pretty much everything; but I haven't persevered with  the app on my smartbrush. For family use Braun still haven't really solved the family use feature which would make this great for life with kids as the toothbrush could rat them out if they didn't brush long enough or properly. One thing the app is good for; is tracking what your dentists advice is about brushing (when they tell you to brush your X more) you can program targeted areas into the app and it reminds you to brush them each time you use it. The last of the accessories to go with the connect to your phone motif is the 9000 series came with a mirror suction mount to hold your phone; the smart 6 comes with a weighted rubberised white puck that holds your phone.The braun brushes and the basic tooth cleaning modes are very good. I am not sure the app isn't technology trying to find a use. The sensitive and whitening modes have their uses; sensitive being good your tongue in conjunction with the included sensitive brush head. The battery life and charging are an issue; so  I use a Braun brush  at home twice.a day all the time and keep it on charge. When I pack a suitcase I take a Philips sonicare the battery life is no better but the usb recharging makes life so much simpler than even the braun 9000 series charging case.",4
3608,"The framework for the narrative is solar eclipses through recent years which - although it sounds un-promising - actually works!  Each chapter is headed by a major character in the story at a particular date in time.  One minute you're in (e.g.) 2015 (with Kit) then 1999 (with Laura) etc etc - unlike conventional novels which move forward chronologically in twists and turns. As a result, just when you think you're following the story and have the characters 'sussed', you are in for a series of shocks and surprises.  For most of the novel it seems that there are two 'goodies' (one male/one female) and two 'baddies (one male/one female) but by the end you discover that the REAL 'goodies' and 'baddies' are of the same gender.  I'll leave it there as I don't want to spoil the ending for you.  Enjoy.....",4
3609,"The good, the bad and the ugly.As you probably read - this toothbrush is 3 parts - the toothbrush it self which can work on it's own, the timer/clock - which shows the current time, timer of the brushing and some ""grade"" for your brush.The good - this is a great toothbrush. I love the watch/timer that is something you can use - not only when you are brushing your tooth.The app is also mostly nice - shows you the timing while brushing with some indication which part of the mouth you are supposed to brush on the same time. Plus - it shows you nice world news - which I live and not since it's not changing enough.It also has all kind of abilities - like type of brushing, (regular, tongue cleaning, whitening) and all kind of strengths.The bad - The only bad thing - that might be related with my phone - but should be dealt by the app - is disconnections - which result in the app thinks I stopped brushing while i actaully still am (2 options for Oral-B could be - a. noise of toothbrush. b. reconnect and check)The ugly - the app is taking all the brushing activities - even if my wife used it. It should be very simple to enable to sync only mine. Or only ""save"" the ones I use - but it seems they prefer to sell the 6500 - so each person will use their own toothbrush.And the most important thing - healthI used to go to the dentist hygenist to remove ""scale"" or ""stones"" (not sure of the correct word) - every 3 months.I think I can now go around 6 months or even more.This means That the value is even greater from my point of view.Also I just found out that the ""kids"" oral B heads can also connect to the same machine.Please notice - you could get the version with the timer only - without the app - it should be ok for the most of us.",4

3611,"The included timer is really useful, the Bluetooth - not so much.The carry case is nice but cheap feeling. The extra brush heads are great, especially if you don't know which type will suit you best. The stand is really spread out and takes a lot of space. Would not recommend it to those with small sinks/storage areas. The battery doesn't last long, about 5-7 days and being NiMH means I don't expect it to have a long life.",4
3612,The instruction booklet is a host of details as to how one operates the razor and maintain it which caused some apprehension initially as I was making an expensive purchase compared to previous razors bought. After a week of use I found it giving me an excellent shave,4
3613,"The is quite a spellbinding book with twists to keep the reader guessing.Though it has a slowish start, the novel is narrated by a couple, Laura and Kit. They give their different viewpoints at various intervals as the story moves back and forward over a period of sixteen years. The pair are avid eclipse watchers. In 1999 at The Lizard in Cornwall, where an eclipse is about to take place, Laura sees an apparent sexual assault on a woman named Beth. She sends Kit off to chase him, but fails to do so.As the book progresses, we learn more about the incident, including a stunning twist that makes us every everything from a different point of view. Nothing can be taken for granted.After the violent segment towards the end of the book, everything seems all over, but the very last paragraph contains a startling twist all of it's own.Erin Kelly creates two fine characters in Laura and Kit, but holds back on certain facts about them to give us a big surprise.",4
3614,The kids love it!! It has so much for them to do on it and the battery lasts really well! I’m very impressed.,4
3615,The kids love them and I love the parental controls. Only downside is they are constantly running out of memory and coming up with 'Storage critically low' so can't download any books etc. I am not sure whether this is because both profiles are stored on both tablets because they are linked to me.  They only had them at Christmas and last week.,4
3616,"The kindle is ideal for my 5 year old son. The kids amazon subscription is OK, could do with more content on there for a wide range of ages. It's geared more towards the younger child. The downloaded content he has on his kindle is fine when connected to WiFi, once WiFi is off you can't tell what your looking at because all the pictures disappear. Apart from that it's good.",4
3617,"The major thing about the Oral-B 6000 is that it gives you a really great clean. My teeth feel like every spot of plaque has been removed and are squeaky clean. But that would probably be true of any of the Oral-B range, so you pays your money, and takes your choice. for a saving of £35, I would probably go for the 5000 series.On unpacking and following an overnight charge, the toothbrush was ready for action. Having downloaded the App, and connected iPhone to Brush, I was ready to go.The 6000 is supplied with 4 different brush heads, assuming that you may want to use all of the different types so you may need to get a set for other family members.CrossActionFlossAction3D WhiteSensitiveThere are also a number of different programs or modes that can be selected from stardard, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and gum. All run a different speeds, or vary the speed of the brush. I usually stick to standard or whitening, and my wife prefers sensitive ... at least this 6000 model gives you the choice.The toothbrush is supplied with a decent travel case which will hold the toothbrush body and a couple of heads ... but not the charger.As usual, the mains lead supplied fits a continental socket or shaver socket. Fortunately we have a shaver socket in our bathroom, otherwise I would be hunting down a Euro converter.I can't say that I will take much notice of the bluetooth element. It might be a bit of a motivator for kids who need to be cajoled into cleaning their teeth, but the App isn't really designed with kids in mind. You don't need to walk into your bathroom with your smart phone and bluetooth enabled each time, as the brush body will store up to 20 sessions which will sync with your phone at a later date if you are interested in such things.I do like the wireless Smart Guide module ... probably as much for having an easy to read clock in the bathroom as having a count up timer.Bottom line is ... I got a really great clean from the 6000, but the 5000 does everything I want.",4
3618,"The mixed reviews of this book are quite understandable.Yes, the rape scene in the aftermath of an eclipse, raises the interest level acouple of notches, and the backwards and forwards of blame that ensuesthroughout the next 15 years kind of keeps you guessing; all that anticipationand conflicting views keeps the readers on their toes, the ending twist isOk'ish, but somehow lacks that knockout punch.But for that this could have been a GREAT book instead of a GOOD one.",4
3619,"The only problem with this product is that there is no 'release' button. A button that opens the arms out would be very useful, as when your attempting to slide you phone into it, you have to try and hold out the spring loaded arms at the same time and often find your phone being catapulted. Once you have mastered the technique however there is no drama.",4
3620,The only thing stopping a 5 star review is the fact that when using some apps the home button often gets in the way and ends up closing the app that you’re in.,4

3622,"The Oral-B 6000 seems to be a good electric toothbrush, as long as you can get it at a discounted price. However it's perhaps a bit on the bulky side, presumably to provide the slightly longer (roughly 7-day) battery life than the cheaper model. Unfortunately the battery life of all these Oral-B electric toothbrushes is pretty disappointing, so it's not possible to go on a 2-week vacation without taking the charger unit. I wish they would focus on improving battery life, and shortening the recharge time, rather than including fairly unnecessary gadgets such as the ""Wireless SmartGuide"".",4
3623,"The Oral-B Pro 6000 offers everything you could want from a toothbrush, and plenty of things you won't have thought of too. In terms of cleaning, what you get is pretty top notch - the brush head is reassuringly firm without being prickly, and it feels like you achieve a good clean. There are a number of cleaning setting available for brushing, including a ""sensitive"" option; so there should be no discomfort here (I used the setting, and didn't feel I got quite as vigorous a clean). As well as this, the toothbrush comes with a smart monitor, which times how long you can brush for (the brush vibrates every 30 seconds, too), pressure sensors which will tell you if you're brushing too hard (both via the brush and the smart monitor) and connects to your phone via bluetooth.This bluetooth functionality seems a little extraneous to me, and I don't see myself using it. Basically, your phone provides the same information as the smart monitor, plus the ability to track your brushing, and hints and tops for brushing. I wouldn't have considered this as something I was interested in, and only tried the feature for the purposes of review. You can, however, happily ignore this and continue to enjoy the toothbrush.The brush itself feels pretty robust, without being too heavy, and it's clear numerous electronics have been crammed into a very small device. The brush comes with four different heads: for flossing, whitening, sensitive teeth and trizone cleaning. A travel case is also provided for good measure, which seems to fit the brush well (you'll need to pack the charging station separately). In terms of battery, the box claims to be able to last 10 days (2 minutes' burshing twice a day), and this seems in line with my experience.In concluding, there's no doubt that the Oral-B Pro 6000 offers a spotless clean. And there are plenty of added functionalities, both useful and gimmicky. If you're looking for a high-end toothbrush. this has everyone you could possibly want, and a fair bit you don't. But at the reduced price of £90, the Oral-B Pro 6000 is worth it.",4
3624,"The Oral-B Pro 6000 SmartSeries is a very effective toothbrush that feels like a serious piece of kit and comes with a nice range of accessories: wireless SmartGuide, charging station with brush head storage, travel case and four different types of brush head. In particular, the CrossAction brush head - Oral-B's ""most advanced"" head - really feels like it's going to work on your teeth, gum line and tongue.But the marquee feature of this model is the fact that it's Bluetooth-enabled, and unfortunately it's this feature that falls flat. The first thing to mention is that it only works with Bluetooth 4.0, so if you have a phone with Bluetooth 3.0 you're out of luck. Secondly the app you use with the toothbrush is in dire need of development. Before using the toothbrush I imagined an intelligent app that would effortlessly record a range of new things about my brushing habits and suggest methods of improvement. Instead I got poor layout, flaky connection and a range of information that isn't much better than what the wireless SmartGuide has to offer.In my opinion Oral-B has made an error of judgement here. Who wants to be carting their smartphone into the bathroom, trying to get it to connect to their toothbrush, whenever it's time to brush their teeth? Oral-B should really have concentrated on improving the SmartGuide's capabilities. It's already there ready and waiting, showing you the brushing mode used, the duration of use, and informing you when you're applying too much pressure and when it's time to replace the brush head - why not store all of that data? Then, rather than the toothbrush having Bluetooth, the SmartGuide could have it instead, so you could take the SmartGuide to your phone, sync the data and analyse it at your leisure. Oral-B's suggestion that you would use your phone as a remote control for your toothbrush is so unrealistic it's risible.Despite this, I really like the toothbrush itself. It's well-built, feels very nice to use, and the CrossAction head is wonderful. Plus - who knows? - maybe Oral-B will develop its smartphone app to the point where it's actually worth using.",4
3625,"The Oral-B Pro 6000 Toothbrush offers your teeth an excellent clean, and it is great that it comes with 4 different styles of brush heads so you can find the one to suit you. It offers a variety of different settings, and will 'rate' your brushing based on how long you brush for and how hard you push. It comes with a container for travel which is very handy, in which you can fit two brush heads.It truly gives a great clean, but then much lower priced toothbrushes give the same effect. The extra settings on the toothbrush are rather unnecessary, and the bluetooth connectivity drains the battery so that it loses charge after 4-5 days.Overall, a rather expensive item for a few gimmicks that arguably don't justify the cost.",4

3630,"The smiley face that appears on the wireless timer at the end of a successful brushing session has proven to be an encouragement for our brushing-averse daughter to brush properly morning and night.The provision of 4 heads in the pack - and storage for them on the charging stand - is useful as it allows the whole family to use the same 'brush' while having their own head. The only slight downside is that each of the heads is a different type, obviously as a means of advertising the range available, but it does mean that if you want to make used of the free brushes, you'll have to decide who gets which type.The toothbrush has several modes allowing you to tailor your brushing experience, and it is possible to personalise things further using a smartphone app, but I've not tried this yet.Ultimately, it's a question of whether the features make it better than the less expensive brushes available from the same manufacturer. In my opinion, the price difference is greater than the performance difference, but if you like the timer and the other non-essential extras, it is still a very good brush.",4
3631,"The story starts with an alleged sexual attack on Beth by Jamie and it is partially witnessed by Laura and close behind by her boyfriend Kit.  The saga then unfolders, over two time periods, 15 years apart, between these 4 characters, and their ever changing relationships and fears.  Who is the one with the obsessive behaviour and who is hiding lies? The characters are well layered and you’re often pulled in directions that make you feel you know where the story is going, except that may not be the case.The development of the story is great and a super plot with plenty of twists and turns.  My main criticism as with many other reviewers is that the middle third of the story drags and I found myself putting the book down and reading other books in-between. Once the story picks up again in the final third it is really good and keeps you going right to the end.  The ending is one of the best endings I’ve read because it’s not the typical ending that drags out to finish a story long after the plot has ended, and there are twists right to the final page.The middle third of the story prevents me giving 5 stars.",4

3638,"The toothbrush is a pretty standard Oral-B electric toothbrush with the addition of Bluetooth which lets it talk to the enclosed wall unit and an app on your phone.The wall unit is very good; showing the time when you’re not brushing your teeth it’s a handy addition to the bathroom wall. it affixes to a plastic holder which itself can be screwed to the wall or attached with the provided 3M strips which are removable at a later date without damaging paintwork.When you turn the toothbrush on to start cleaning your teeth the wall unit shows a 2 minute count down and which zone (left, right, upper and lower) you should be focusing on.I feel that the app lets this product down; the interchangeable heads of the toothbrush clearly lends itself to being used by more than one person, but the app is very much geared towards only one. From the app you can sync your brushing history from the brush, but it includes every time it’s being used and is a relatively slow process to go through and manually delete other users’ data.While brushing, the app provides a slightly enhanced version of the wall unit (countdown timer, zones, etc.) plus some news stories and other trivia to read while you’re brushing. Unfortunately if you decide to switch apps it will pause the timer until you come back to the Oral B app.",4
3639,"The toothbrush is very good, however, I find most of the extras rather useless. It is not worth the full price, but get it if it's on sale!",4
3640,"The unit is a cordless multi-function shaver that comes with it's own charging station. In all you are getting the shaver, charger/washer unit, cable, storage/travel case, brush and a cartridge of cleaning solution. The charging station, which also serves as the cleaning station, is quite large and goes against the idea of the unit being a portable shaver.Thankfully the cleaning/charging station is not essential as a cable is provided which enables the user to plug the shaver directly into a power supply, thereby enhancing the portability aspect. The charging level on the shaver being indicated by LEDs. A single charge having lasted me for a couple of weeks now despite daily use.Ergonomically the shaver fits comfortably in the hand and looks good, as does the provided robust well fitting case. The head of the shaver can be rotated or locked in position and the level of trim required can be adjusted. A sideburn trimmer being a welcome extra.In practice I have found the shaver to be excellent and probably the best electric shaver I've ever used, although the hefty price is somewhat off-putting. Having said that, if you want a top of the range electric shaver which produces excellent results, that looks the part and is comfortable to use, then you need look no further. Thank you.",4
3641,"There are really three aspects to this device; as a toothbrush, with the remote screen and with bluetooth. Bluetooth is not my thing & I can't really envisage a world where I would want to install an app on my phone/tablet (I am fairly fussy about what I put on them) to talk to my toothbrush so I'll pass on that aspect.I decided to try the brush simply as a brush first without the ""smart guide"" for a few days. I've used a number of Oral B brushes over the years and always been happy with them and this one is no exception. It cleans well and works well. It gives you 30 second visual/vibration/audible warnings on brushing which is ok but I find I've tended not to worry about too much that in the past. What I did find was that I had no real way of knowing what mode I was in so I set up the smart guide device.It didn't take long to do that after I'd fiddled a bit and then read the instructions (!) and it has the time on it, a smiley and some stars. I understand another reviewer's comment that the device helped a youngster to clean their teeth properly. Having used electric brushes for well over 10 years now I guess I thought I was doing the job reasonably well however I found the smart guide did help to do it ""right"" as it indicates 30 second intervals and a quadrant to be cleaning as well as the current mode setting. I found this helpful in general and looking at for example getting the tongue cleaning setting almost essential. I have to say I do find it can be slightly irritating too as there are times when I am in more of a rush and end up getting a sad face and less stars so it may work well for some and less so for others.In passing the cross action brush which comes with it is an excellent addition to the range for me. I found it very good at cleaning. You get one of these and three other brushes with this device (not the tri-action one though which is the other Oral B brush I prefer). Is it worth over 200 quid - probably not but there is no reason you should pay that on Amazon and I imagine elsewhere. Is it worth something a bit over 100 quid - almost certainly however unless you really want your phone to talk to your toothbrush maybe go down a model and loose the bluetooth. It is an excellent brush (4.5/5 probably) which is at least as good as my usual brush which is a good Philips Sonicare. I plan to continue using both and will update this review as time goes by.UPDATED after 6 months use. The problem I have with this toothbrush is the battery. It takes at least 24 hours to charge it once it is flat and I guess the answer to that is to leave it on the charger when not in use. However our bathroom simply isn't suitable for that. However today, halfway through brushing my teeth (!), the battery went from 2 bars to dead inside a minute. I'm going to give it one more chance and will update this after that however if it isn't more reliable I am going to bin it. I guess it is the first bad Oral B brush I've had in years but based on my experiences with this one I cannot recommend it.",4
3642,"There was a real sense of nervousness at the beginning of this book. The blurb mentioned an attack during the aftermath of an eclipse so I assumed it had something to do with that. It was clear that the story started off after that particular event and this meant that I would have to piece together all the details. At this point I had a million questions racing through my mind!The mystery of why Laura and Kit were so nervous hung over the storyline and forced me to keep turning the pages. It became a need - I needed to know why this couple were being targeted when all they had done was help someone.The author's words created a 'just one more page' atmosphere (all you bookish people out there know all about that one, am I right?). I couldn't figure out how this one event could have possibly affected the rest of their lives so drastically.I enjoyed the scenes from the year 2000 but I equally enjoyed the scenes set in 2015. Sometimes I find it difficult to keep track when a book jumps from one time line to another but this one worked perfectly and allowed me to gradually fill in the gaps between the two.On the cover of the book were the words 'Who do you believe?' and I have to say that I just wasn't sure. My opinion changed several times until the truth started to seep through and then I had chills. I admit I was surprised. I think the realness of this story is what made it so good, I could actually imagine it all happening, what a freaky thought!Secrets and lies all tangle together in this heart-poundingly good psychological thriller.",4
3643,"There's a lot to like about this shaver. It's a tad garish looking to be honest, all super shiny chrome style with a butch and rather complex shave head, but there's no denying it's very well designed and put together and it does actually do a very good job. I've owned several shavers and ultimately let them go because the performance to price ratio has never been there. I even had an older model to this one with the same sterilization/cleaning bath set up. This device gives a very good, fairly close shave. It's not up to the standard of a good manual wet shave but using it 'wet' is comfortable and the usual problem of electric shavers, razor burn, is less of a problem. I think overall it's OK in that respect.It comes in a nice box and looks prestigious throughout, even the plastic bags inside are quality ... so, possibly a very nice present for someone. The sterilization bath is good in terms of its ability to clean but tends towards spilling unless you are careful. In reality, once you have a place for it in your bathroom then all you need to do is change the bath tank every so often, so it's a reducing problem. First time tho' you might find more spills out than you retain - take care! Whether it actually adds enough value to justify the replacement tanks, which aren't cheap, is debatable. Overall, I see this set up as more en extra income stream for Braun than a high value benefit to the owner. The instruction book is comprehensive and I was left with no questions after skimming through it. Of course, few of us ever read these books and I'm the same. It all fits together fairly obviously, so it probably doesn't matter.So overall, while I see the quality and performance as high for an electric, when looking purely in terms of wet shaving comparison it does fall down value wise. Given the high cost it's hard to recommend strictly on those terms, but if you want electric, want the cleaning solution, want the wet dry and want the prestige looks then give it a go. The rating given considers these benefits and assumes you have decided price is less of an issue.",4
3644,"There's certainly a lot of kit with this Braun electric toothbrush. Four separate brush heads, with holder, a travelling case and a bluetooth enabled monitor that not only works separately but can also connect to an app on your phone.First things first, the toothbrush itself is very very good. Easy to use, and by that I don't mean brushing. I mean its easy to switch between the four brush heads and also to switch between the different modes of brushing the model has. By the electronic monitor you can easily see which mode you are on and it counts down a 2 minute clock to show you how long to brush. The brush also lights up every 30 seconds to show you to change ""quadrant"" in your mouth.Lots of it seems a little superfluous though, before you even get to the app that monitors your routine. I simply don't see the need for it and won't use it. Battery life is short, and charge time is long though its very simple to charge.Great toothbrush but falls short of five stars for me due to the expense and the fact that some of the features simply seem overkill and things I won't use.",4
3645,These are a lot smaller than I thought they would be and a bit flimsey looking. Okay for what I paid.,4
3646,These are great for on the go but can be difficult to get to cover a small window as the Velcro leaves gaps. When it is up it’s great at cutting out light and works really well,4
3647,"These are just awesome for blacking out windows but as they are actually black, they do heat up any sun facing rooms very quickly!",4
3648,These are nice little earings. They come packaged very well and my wife really likes them.  A bargain too!,4
3649,These are very pretty and get lots of compliments. a complete bargain for the price. I love them.,4
3650,These blinds block out the light well. The best part is that you can adapt them to the size you need.,4
3651,They are very good at blocking out day light but dont stay up fully.,4
3652,They came when they said they would....lot smaller than I thought the picture made them look a lot bigger can't believe they dropped from £135 to £5.99,4
3653,"They do the job, room is much darker. They are a bit of a hassle to put on but it's worth it.",4
3654,They looked good but much smaller than expected,4
3655,Things I do not like in this toothbrush is the noise and charging time. I am more frequently using the sensitive function (which reduce the noise). If you gonna have it plugged all the time it will be charged but if you want to charge it from time to time it will take few hours to charge.Other than above it is a very good product.,4
3656,"Think you should get Velcro to stick on Windows as there is Velcro on the curtains as well as sucky pads,  happy with the quality,  totally does the job now I've bought extra Velcro.",4
3657,"This 'Smart' toothbrush from Oral B is the step before the more expensive 'Genius' line, but seeing as the only tangible difference between the 'Genius' and this 'Smart' is the ability for the toothbrush to detect where you're positioning the brush on your teeth and if it's in the correct position, I'd say that this one is the better value, unless you go the step even further for the highest end dual charging 'Genius'.Anyway, the packaging here is simple and inside you find a very well designed and made carry case, stand, charger, handle, phone stand and three heads. I charged the handle for a couple of hours, and appreciated straightaway the mobile phone-like charging progress bars. The display is actually very nice as a whole actually, where each setting is denoted by a different pictogram. You have to click a separate button to cycle through these settings.The different settings are quite noticeable, with the sensitive one being the most I think, where the hardness of the vibration is lessened, meaning you get a softer brush, which is recommended on the back of the packaging of most sensitive toothpastes. I can't say that the whitening mode has really made my teeth any whiter though, but this may bee because I refuse to go anywhere near whitening toothpastes. I mainly use the daily clean mode or the sensitive mode (with the included head).The app connectivity is fun, but I don't really use it. I want to be in and out of the bathroom as soon as possible in the morning, and when the 2 minute timer of this runs out, with the pressure sensor not being tripped I'm done. You can change the colour of the light on the shoulder of the handle in the app, but the rest of it seems a novelty that I imagine will wear off pretty quickly. I brush twice a day every day and for two minutes each time – I don't need an app to confirm this for me.As for the rest, the battery life is fantastic, the heads are of good quality and pleasingly widely available and cheap, which is more than can be said of the ridiculously expensive replacement heads of the Philips Sonicare.",4
3658,"This blind has been amazing, it fits a variety of windows and has meant my daughter will sleep in an extra hour. Only slight downside is that the suction cups have fallen on on occasion, easy to put them back up though so not a big problem!",4
3659,This blind is really good! I bought two and had them sewn together and altered to fit the size of the window in the nursery (our windows are on the large size) my twins have slept through the night since having this up at the window and would definitely recommend.,4
3660,This blind really darkens the room. I bought it for the nursery. I already had a black out roller blind up but due to the type of windows we have they had to be fitted outside the window frame which resulted in light getting in around the edges. This blind is very big! It has suckers that stick to the windows and is a bit awkward to try and fit it. I ended up putting it up and leaving it and rarely open the blinds now as it's a lot of work taking it down then putting it up. It does work though and my baby sleeps more soundly than he did before we had it so I'd recommend it. We're going on holiday to a caravan soon and I'll be taking it with us,4
3661,"This blocks the light well and is the best temporary solution I have found so far. Definitely not suitable for every day use though, it takes a few minutes to get it in place and the suction cups sometimes do not work very well.",4
3662,This book deals with suspense and plot twists very well while tackling one of the great problems of our times.,4
3663,"This book made me annoyed throughout...and I couldn't stop reading it! It tells the story of Kit and Laura, one horrible night at an eclipse festival and the subsequent fifteen years of hiding. The chapters are split between Laura's perspective and Kit's, which is a good way of rounding out the action and revealing certain aspects by drip feed. The subject matter is difficult - it deals with the rape of a girl, Beth, and the aftermath but the actual attack is not too graphically detailed and the author considers the emotional implications too. What made me annoyed was that the book described the prevailing culture in the justice system to put the woman involved on trial in terms of her sexual background. The very title of the book demonstrates the often painful result of going to court - it is his word against hers. I also was irritated by Laura, who was a little bit goody two shoes and Kit, who was a little bit ineffectual. Some of the reveals are shocking and the ultimate path of the story is pretty compelling. I can't say that I enjoyed this book, but it certainly kept me turning the pages.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.",4
3664,"This book started out very quickly but then, I found it slowed down, part way through. Once past the slowness it picked up a pace which had so many twists and turns it made me say 'Oh' out loud quite a few times!To anyone who thinks this book goes 'quiet' - persevere, you will not be disappointed.",4
3665,"this brush is top of the range, i love the case but it would be nice if all 4 heads fitted in it as they all do different things. the new cross action heads i find are quite gentle and do a really fantastic job of cleaning your teeth . the smart guide is useful the pressure sensor is a good thing to have but it is heavier than the usual brush handles to accomodate the bluetooth and as others have said i really dont see the pointof it maybe some teens might like it for a few days but really all it does for me is drain the battery faster, i do however love he battery life indicator, the case for me is more useful than the stand for the heads but thats just my preference",4
3666,"This brush was obtained with the express purpose of educating a young child on how to brush properly. There is an absolute myriad of phone apps out there to assist with brushing, but if you're anything like me you don't really want to mix up clumsy children, running water and technology.This is a great unit, and worth the expense. It can seem gimmicky at first, but when you take in to account the additional extras, the extra brush heads, the technology that goes in to the functionality, then it is worth it. Plus your phone is no longer in the line of fire for the sake of dental hygiene education ;)Use your common sense on this one - if it's for a younger member of your family have it on a lower-powered setting, with a smaller brush head. You have the options; so use them. A great addition to the family bathroom.",4
3667,This came up ever so slightly smaller than advertised and so left a gap around out window. Otherwise it's good. Luckily the little one doesn't seem to mind and sleeps soundly most nights!,4
3668,"This certainly does give a terrific shave. It is very maneuverable. Although it's not so good on longer hairs, so it's great if you shave every day and you like a close shave but if you just shave a couple of times a week, it might not be so ideal. It's comfortable to hold and hugs the skin nicely. This one is as the wet and dry facility although I never get so rushed off my feet I feel I need to shave in the shower. It comes with hard-top case and a two-pin plug. I like the fact that it's cordless. The instructions say that only needs charging up for one hour, even with first-time. So you can use the shaver right out of the box. I plugged mine in for an hour and, sure enough, it showed a full charge.It's a very nice-looking, sleek machine. I like the multihead lock switch on the front because it's just nicely shaped for your thumb.You use this to lock the head into a specific position. There are far to choose from. This is a great innovation. It weighs in at 215g approx on my kitchen scales. Really like the fact that the trimmer is integrated. It simply slides up at the back. You can do it with one hand. I also like the soft-grip rubberised feel on the back so it's not going to slip out of your hands if they are damp. It comes with its own little bottle of lubricating oil but there is no brush.For this kind of money, I would have liked a brush.I have the 9040s w&d model, which you cannot use corded. The head comes off easily for cleaning -- there are two side buttons you press together. I've just been running it under the tap and leaving it to dry. I'm impressed with this shaver. It's nicely designed and gives a great shave.",4
3669,"This comes well packaged, and complete - there are four brush heads, 2 pin charging adaptor for bathrooms (requires 3 pin adaptor for outside the bathroom), clear travel case and the external monitor and wall mount (comes with batteries).The brush already has charge so it's simple to get started straight away - even setting up the bluetooth monitor was easy and it set itself to the correct time and date.Very easy to use and there are six different modes - daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, gum care and tongue cleaning. All seems a bit over the top, and I generally use the daily clean although I did try each mode.The brush is excellent, as I've found generally from Braun - holds a decent charge, has plenty of power while brushing and does a good job.The bluetooth monitoring seems to be a bit of a gimmick, I've got the monitor attached to the wall at eye level and it tells you when to change parts of the mouth (the brush does this well enough by a quick stop/start) and you get smiley faces - good for young children. The timer is set at two minutes, but you can change this.As this was a review product, I downloaded the app for iPhone just to test it all - not something I would normally have done. It surprised me, as even though I mentioned the bluetooth connection was a gimmick, the app is actually quite good. As well as the information listed above, it also displays snippets of news, photos, quotes, facts, and other daft snippets so you can see what's happening in the world and use the time while brushing.Overall, I like the tooth brush. It cleans your teeth as well as any other of the type, but it's on the more expensive side due to the wireless connectivity and monitoring. If you can live without that, then I'd recommend a cheaper model as it will do the same job, but I have to admit that I like reading bits of news while I'm waking up.Recommended.",4
3670,"This has an interesting story line and plenty of twists to keep interest going after a slow start. However, don't make the mistake of reading other books by this author - I tried one and found it very unbelievable and not nearly so well written.Maybe this book is the start of better things from Erin Kelly.",4
3671,This has helped with the light coming into my daughters room when she goes to bed.,4
3672,"This has made a massive difference to my daughter's sleep pattern. As the mornings got lighter, her wake up times were getting unbearable but this really helped. Room is so dark once the blind is up. The blind has fallen down on one corner a few times which made it lose a star but the whole thing is pretty well designed.",4
3673,"This is a book that succeeds only because the main characters all choose to hang onto information. With this, the entire story is hanging by a thread and comes crumbling down if any of them do the one thing that, basically, real people do - and talk.Despite that stretch of credibility, the book is very well plotted and written. It's exceptional, really, that in the age of cheap ebooks, cheaper ideas, and appalling writing that a book this well crafted has overcome all around it. The success is deserved. I did roll my eyes once or twice at the contrivances - but I do think that should be forgiven for the sheer skill in the final product.",4
3674,"This is a cordless shaver that comes with it's own charging station.  The charging station doubles as a cleaning station and there is an alcohol based pack you place inside the station and then place the shaver in for cleaning.  I have not so far used it enough to say if this is effective or not.  What I can say is that the charging station is so big that my wife has already expelled it from the bathroom and I have to store it in my wardrobe.  Luckily you can plug the power supply straight into the shaver, which takes up very little space.  Charging/ charge level is indicated by some blue LEDs it did not take a great deal of time to charge up and it has held it charge well for a week's worth of shaves and looks to have at least a couple more week's worth in it.In terms of shaving Braun recommend that this is done beofre you wash you face.  I tried a couple of days old beard and it coped very well, being not too painful.  It does not match the results you get from wet shaving but it is not bad.  With the switch in one position the head is fully rotating.  I don't have a square face by any means so this came in very useful.  Switching to the other position keep the head firm to allow you to get under the nose more easily.  Flip to the back and there is a sideburn trimmer.The package also comes with a well fitting robust zip up case. It has been used on a business trip already and it works well for it.  All in all this is a well though through package, but the cleaning station is too big!  Recommended",4
3675,"This is a dark, murky and atmospheric psychological thriller, it is a tale of Laura and her boyfriend, Kit, chasing an eclipse in Cornwall where Laura happens to see a violent attack being carrried out on Beth by Jamie. Laura insists on calling the police. A traumatic and brutal court case ensues with Jamie on trial for rape. Laura is the only eye witness. Jamie's family are there to support him and the defence run Beth ragged, it becoming a case of he said, she said. Jamie finally ends up being convicted, in a crime where there is such a low percentage of convictions.After the trial, Beth comes to visit and she and Laura begin to build a friendship, only for things to go awry and ends up with Laura and Kit's home burning down. Laura and Kit change their names, go on the run and get married with the hope that they are untraceable. Years later in the present, Laura is pregnant and Kit is off to chase another eclipse as the past comes back to threaten their lives once more. This is a story where nothing is as it appears, there are secrets, lies. issues of trust and multiple twists. It is an intricately plotted story revolving around the four characters, their relationships and interactions with each other and the issue of perception. On occasion the story feels a little over egged for the sheer sake of it. However, overall I found it an entertaining and absorbing story steeped with an air of menace and fear. Thanks to Hodder and Stoughton for an ARC.",4
3676,"This is a fascinating read which leads the reader on what seems a straightforward, if worrying, journey through the past events of Laura and Kit's lives.Taking us between the present and 1999 and told in turn by Laura and Kit, we learn about their first meeting and Kit's fascination with eclipses, which leads to some horrifying and life-changing events when they go to Cornwall to see the 1999 eclipse. It is this event which brings Beth into their lives and sets the course for the next 16 years.Erin Kelly describes a damaged individual and psychotic behaviour with aplomb and conviction. As both the past and present stories unfold there is mounting tension between the characters but also between the pages.As I read I felt unnerved, a sense of foreboding. Something was not quite right but I couldn't quite out my finger on it...Such is the epic writing of Erin Kelly that it had me completely hooked and when the finale came, I was not disappointed. I hadn't guessed the twist. The story leads the reader to think of different scenarios, keeping us guessing but always alert for clues. It's a labyrinth of what could happen and delves into the psyche of more than one character.Although initially it seems to be a straightforward story of a crime and its after effects, it is much, much more, portraying as it does the complexities of relationships, trust and truth and Erin Kelly does this brilliantly with her, not always likable, in fact sometimes downright unlikable, characters who are whole, three dimensional and utterly believable.If you want your mind to be teased and tormented, then look no further, this book does it.",4
3677,"This is a good addition to the Oral-B range with some questionable capabilities.It is an excellent toothbrush, with different modes of operation which will fit varied needs, including modes friendly for children.The brush comes with a wonderful little screen that can be placed nearby, or stuck on the wall/mirror that operates as a clock when the brush is not in use, and offers a timer when in use.

There is a tongue cleaning function. This is utter nonsense and I remember watching a comedy sketch about this years ago. You do not need to clean your tongue!The brush connects with Bluetooth to your smartphone/tablet. Keeps data on your brushing etc etc. Utter nonsense. What do you want to do that for? I challenge anyone to use this function more than once. The app on android works well and displays news and info to keep you amused while you are  brushing (do you get that bored, that easily?). Otherwise the app is 88Mb that will probably clog up your phone's memory.The brush comes with a travel plastic kit etc as well which is handy I guess if you want to stick this entire device and accessories in your luggage.For those of you crazy about connectivity and a smart home and all this stuff, this will be a good purchase.For the rest of you, this is still a good purchase and the little screen will keep the kids amused while brushing (while the app will probably never be used).",4

3679,"This is a good shaver, and it looks nice, although I personally don't like chrome effect plastic. It's not that heavy (220g/10oz) but does have a feeling of quality about it, which you'd expect from a top end Braun product.This unit did work well, but I think it performs best on short stubble; usually I grow mine a touch longer. I do have sensitive skin, and like all electric shavers my skin felt a little dry after, but nothing excessive that a moisturiser wouldn't fix, and the unit can be used in wet mode also, which helps.The unit charged from flat to full in around an hour, but I didn't time it. It has 5 blue LED bars on the handle to indicate charge level, and counts down the last 9mins of charge life in numbers, which is a nice touch. In use, it's not too loud, but not what I'd describe as quiet, and the vibrations to your hand from the cutting head are minimal, which is good.The carry case is the best I've seen, hard shell, leather look, zip up and 'tailored' to fit the shaver perfectly, top marks. You get a little cleaning brush, which fits in the case. The charger would not fit.The cleaning module (and charger dock), Clean and Renew, comes with a cartridge of fluid (170ml); other similar shavers I've had before came with a bottle of cleaning fluid which you poured into the machine. I do feel the bottle method is better, and more cost efficient for the user... is if you run out of the fluid... you could make your own of sorts... where as spending £4-5 on a new cleaning cartridge is an extra expense I wouldn't personally like. One cartridge lasts approximately about 30 cleaning cycles, so potentially just one month... which is an additional £45-60 a year in cleaning. This may work for you, but something to be aware of. The manual says you can run it under the tap though.The charger is a 2-pin shaver style and the unit doesn't come with a 3-pin adaptor. The shaver has a 2 year guarantee.All in all, a really nice unit.",4
3680,"This is a great device and I am very happy with the Fire HD 8 for Kids. My 2 year old Daughter has already started to test its rigidity by throwing it on the floor, in a tantrum.Needless to say it faired very well with the protective case. I am still learning my way around the usage of it ands how to download onto the device for use away from wifi. My daughter on the other hand seems to be getting to grips with how to use it quite well.There is just one concern and that is that if my daughter constantly presses the screen whilst watching a program or film, which she has a habit of doing, the screen goes black and the only way to get it to work again is by rebooting it ans starting up again. Not sure how to stop this from happening and whether there is a way of locking the screen to stop future accidents like this from occurring .",4
3681,This is a great product however in the hot weather the blind attracts the heat something awful and increases the temperature of the room it is in considerably.  Had this in my sons room and had to remove it as it attracted and threw off so much heat into the room.,4
3682,"This is a great product if you want to be quiet and in the dark, returning it in its package in a mission though.But great item!",4
3683,This is a great product. I bought this to allow me to get a good sleep in the early summer mornings. On the whole it works really well. All you do is attached the suckers to your window and adjust so that it blocks out the light. The only tiny downside is that its a bit fiddly to adjust the suckers on to your window. I'd recommend it as it gets the job done.,4
3684,"This is a great toothbrush and is the best for speed, leaving my teeth feeling wonderfully smooth and clean, but the vibration could be a bit stronger to thoroughly clean between teeth. It is gentle on the gums and the head is small enough to reach right to the back teeth on all sides- which I always find difficult with larger headed brushes.The instruction manual could have more information in it. I liked the travel case but I found the counter wasn't really necessary and only really worth it to check how long I had been brushing. The brush head case wasn't very secures a keeps opening. I also didn't like the way it could be wall mounted- which is basically just doubled sided tape, meaning you can't more it once it is fixed. For the price- I'd have expected something better.",4
3685,This is a gripping read on quite a topical subject,4
3686,This is a life saver..as im a night worker this blocks out the sun perfectly.,4
3687,"This is a marvellous shaver I really like it. It is very powerful and its shaving action works quickly and efficiently, no need to press hard, just gentle pressure is enough for it to give a close shave. So it doesn't irritate the skin much at all. It's very helpful that you can clean it by rinsing under the tap, no need to fiddle around brushing it; and it does get very clean this way. It is very luxurious. I say this because it is a luxury, being so expensive, and that's why I gave four stars rather than five. The cheaper Braun shavers give a very good shave too, and so if you're on a budget you can do very well with a cheaper one. But if you are feeling like treating yourself, this is the one!",4
3688,"This is a really excellent tooth brush which does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth, you can definitely tell the difference over a manual brush. I leave it on its base all the time it isn't in use and the battery life is plenty sufficient for a single brush and is charged in time for the next time you need it.The display shows the time and automatically starts counting when you turn the brush on which is good. There are 4 pieces around the face on the right hand side which tells you which quarter of your mouth you should be brushing and moves on automatically. The motor changes when you need to do this so you can tell even without looking at the screen.You can connect over Bluetooth to a mobile application which essentially shows the same information as the display it comes with. Also, you need to remember to open the app for anything to happen so there isn't much point in it. It also ""helpfully"" reminds you with a notification if you've been using a toothbrush head for too long and recommends you buy some more.The charger has a small area for you to store heads built into the base which is a nice touch. It comes with a few heads of different types to get you started and it comes with a plastic storage case if you need to take the brush on holiday.Overall a really high quality toothbrush but for me the display and the mobile application was a bit too much and gimmicky,",4
3689,"This is a really good read and well written. It's pacy and you want to know the outcome of the next twist in the plot. Added to that, it has an unexpected outcome with a great classic max.",4
3690,"This is a REALLY good toothbrush, according to my dentist I've turned around my standard of dental care in the 7 months I've owned it.  The different modes offered really give a broad appeal and the ability to chart your brushing habits and trends is a nice touch, but I can't see anyone really relying on it.The timer, which indicates zones you should be at and when is a nice touch and mentally gives you a bit of a subliminal push to get the smile face beaming is great.  I find that it runs out of battery very fast (as I use the 3min brush time, instead of the standard 2min)and I've actually had to get one replaced so far, but truthfully? I've never had teeth that have felt so clean.  Just make sure you dock the thing in between uses and you'll not go far wrong.Recommended.",4
3691,"This is a really good toothbrush. I have been using it for over three weeks now and I would find it hard to go back to a manual brush.  In fact, I went away for a weekend and didn't take this away with me and really missed it.  The feature that is really good on this brush is the different speeds that you can use the brush at.  The brush can also be connected to an app on your phone.  I was not too impressed with this feature but I could see it being of value to teenagers who don't clean their teeth for long enough as it might encourage this.  Overall, a really good brush, only getting 4 stars because of the app feature isn't the best but otherwise a really good brush.",4
3692,"This is a really powerful Toothbrush with many features, as for cleaning teeth goes this is the best on the market, but the battery is a not very good and it takes hours and hours to charge which is why its not 5 stars for me.",4
3693,"This is a really well made shaver. I'm coming from the 7 series so will be comparing the two. First, I have to say I'm slightly disappointing with the feel of this shaver as in the picture it looks like a premium product. I'm not sure what I was expecting as the 7 series in my opinion already feels like a premium product but the plastic on the 9 series does feel a little bit cheap to me. It could be because of it's shiny looks or it could be just me.In the box you get the shaver, travel pouch, brush and the clean station. I'm not sure how braun managed this but the travel pouch feels very premium compared to the one provided with the 7 series. The cleaning station also looks sligtly different however it's the same concept. Place the shaver, press a button and leave it to do its thing. It uses the same cartridges (if that's the correct name) so you don't have to buy them again if you're going from the 5 or 7 series (not sure about the 3 however this should also be the case here). My only issue with the cleaning station is that the cable goes in at an slight angle from the bottom.The shaver is well balanced and is comfortable to hold. I had no problems with grip while my hands were wet. The battery life is very good and lasts about a week or so, depending on your usage. With the 9 series, you can now charge the shaver without the cleaning station if you need to charge it while on holiday or if you just don't want to use the cleaning station. The display on the shaver shows you the battery life and when your shaver needs a clean. In my case it needs a clean after every shave however I usually go 2-3 shaves before putting it in the cleaning station. You can also lock the shaver by pressing the on button for about 5 seconds. You will see a lock icon. To unlock, press the on button for about 5 seconds and the lock icon will go away. When the shaver is locked, it will beep but not turn on. The trimmer works well, it slides out easily and smoothly from the back.The shave is pretty good. The biggest difference I've noticed between the 7 series and the 9 series is that the 9 series no longer pulls longer hairs. The shave is very smooth and comfortable. When it comes to how close the 7 and the 9 series are I'd say it's almost (if not) the same. I cannot see a massive difference between the two. The 9 series struggles around the neck just like the 7 series no matter what angle I use it at.Overall, great shaver!",4
3694,"This is a reasonable electric toothbrush but I am not sure how much greater this is than other models.Its USP is a gimmick that it uses bluetooth (radio, not the results of using the brush) which talks to an Android or iOs app. All very well but I don't feel comfortable having my phone in the bathroom while I brush my teeth. I'm not impressed with the App itself. and had difficulty from getting it to connect at first.It seems pretty effective, but I don't feel that there is much difference in the results from the new 3D brush head, which can be bought separately for use with existing Oral-B models.The brush comes with several other heads, the mandatory charger, a travelling case and a brush head store. It also comes with a timer display which performs the same key functions as the not very useful App, although it doesn't keep a long term record of your usage.",4
3695,"This is a slow paced crime thriller that really gets exciting towards the end but plods along most of the way.  The main character Laura is at an eclipse festival with her boyfriend who is absolutely obsessed with eclipses, she witnesses what she thinks is a rape but is never really quite sure despite becoming good friends with the victim, she is constantly in a state of turmoil as to what she thinks she saw and is hearing conflicting stories which just confuse the issue even more.  The book tells the story from the side of Laura the witness, her husband, the victim and the perpetrator and at times I was very unsure who was telling the truth, it certainly kept me guessing.  The twist comes in nicely at the end and really shocked me and I can usually guess twists way before they happen but I didn't with this.  In all it was an enjoyable if somewhat slow read, I usually read a particularly exciting thriller book in under a week, this one took me 3 weeks to finish.",4
3696,"This is a smart, sturdy and well made shaver from Braun. Easy to use and straightforward to set up. Charges in an hour and you can clean the foils using the clean and renew solution included in the pack. My partner used this for a wet shave on a couple of days worth of stubble, the shaver coped well with his face but struggled under his chin! If you have any ingrown hair in your beard this shaver will not shave it off, he found he had to get his disposable razor out to shave these hairs. Sadly this shaver just would not remove the ingrown hairs like a manual razor does. Really disappointing as this razor is otherwise brilliant, and was a much more pleasurable shave than the manual razor.",4
3697,This is a very good brush but the battery life is not very good compared to my previous oral b models. Could be the blu tooth.,4
3698,"This is a very high class shaver, and that is reflected in the price . This is not for the poor man and unless I had been given it to try and review there is no way that I would be able to afford it .It seems to have every  facility that you would want on a shaver is on this  Braun . It is not perfect though and a couple of things need to be addressed : The beard trimmer is somewhat narrow and could do with being wider for trimming sideburns for a start.Now comes the thing that would figure high in my list of things that would prevent me from buying it . I mentioned the price , well it is almost £330. !The instructions (which are quite good) say that one should put it into the clean and charge station after every use . That means you have to use the fluid cassette (one suppllied) which has alcohol inside . It is stated that this will evaporate over time and that it should be renwed every 8 weeks. I am not sure what these  cleaning cartridges cost , but it does mean that there is a constant outflow of money . That coupled with the initial price is a grooming money pit .In the box as delivered is a charging / cleaning station , the shaver itself which as I said earlier has a wealth of facilites like a swivelling multi angle head and a pop up beard trimmer,and a colour display showing the state of charge of the battery and cleaning indicator .There is a very nice zipped shaver case and the whole set is of a very enviable quality . I say enviable , because if I knew anyone that had one of these I would be green with envy . Anyway ,I have one now , so there . I would recommend that you read all the reviews before buying and cost the price of cassettes and heads , which Braun say should be changed every 8 weeks for the cleaning cartridge and 18 months for the head. This is a good razor but I still get a better shave from my old gilllette wet razor that I inherited from my old Dad .",4
3699,"This is a very high quality shaver but the price is not the end of the story. There is a cleaning cartridge for the blade that you are required to replace after only 3-8 weeks depending on use. Also, the blades themselves should be replaced after about 18 months depending on use.Performance: A really good close, accurate shave.  There is a pull out clipper for sideburns or beard trimming that works extremely well.  The small head makes it perfect for detail.Design: This is the largest shaver I have ever used and that is not a bad thing.  It feels solid and meaty in the hand and helps to guide it across the face.  The design is a work of art. Really nice sleek body and surface.The cleaning station is rather loud for some reason but this is not a big issue.Charging is fast and efficient and the Braun should provide about 60:50 (60 min charge time for a 50min shave time). So far I've charged this once and shaved 4 times.I would recommend this product if you take shaving seriously and want a really close neat shave.",4
3700,"This is an early Christmas gift, a good price! Confident it will be fine son used similar products before.CF",4
3701,This is an excellent razor.  The only issue I have is that even after cleaning a warning light comes on after only 10 seconds of use.,4
3702,"This is an insanely fancy toothbrush, and it should be for the price! It includes a 'power brush', a charter, 4 brush heads for different cleaning experiences, a travel case and a wireless guide, which gives you a smiliey face and star rating based on how well you cleaned your teeth from data transmitted wirelessly from the toothbrush.While this is definitely an awesome toothbrush with a million different settings, I think you have to be very committed to dental hygiene to make good use of it. Although my teeth do feel much cleaner than when using my £30 Oral-B toothbrush, I'm not sure I'll use all of the different fancy settings, and I certainly won't be downloading the app on my phone to monitor my brushing habits, because quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time.An excellent toothbrush, but I'm not sure anyone would manage to get good use of all the different settings on it.",4
3703,"This is from the point of view of my son.I have commitment problem with electric shavers. I have shaved with manual `high street' razors for most of my life, but I occasionally get tempted to go electric. This usually happens when I see a shiny new model, promising power, precision, and convenience, and if it's a modern Braun it often lives in an impressive multi-purpose residence as well.Does it shave well?Before I go into a more detailed review, I will answer the most important question in any review of any shaving system: does it shave well? Every man's face is different, but the short answer is, yes, it shaves well enough. This model is pitched at the premium end of Braun's offering, and while it offers a tidy, quick and convenient shave, I'm afraid the results for me simply did not compare with a reasonably careful manual shave. To try and add a tiny bit of scientific comparison and test my own bias, I shaved with various manual razors, ranging from very cheap disposables up to the higher end high street models, straight after shaving with the Braun Series 9 each day for a week, and found that the second, manual shave improved the result on each occasion.Everyone will have a personal view on manual versus electric, but if you are considering making an investment in a Braun Series 9, and you're not a committed electric shaver, I recommend that you see your investment in terms of the many very good features of this system, other than the closest possible shave. The Series 9 offers a convenient, tidy shave, used wet or dry, and enough charge (50 minutes as promised) to use it for several days without charging. If you find yourself wanting or needing a quick late afternoon or early evening shave before heading out, the Series 9 will also deliver. To be fair to Braun, much of the marketing around the Series 9 is about convenience as a key feature of the system.Sensitive skinMy most recent electric system was the 2013 Braun CoolTec  shaver, an affair that lasted about 9 months.  I have sensitive skin (I'm still not sure who doesn't!) and the `cooling' feature worked exactly as promised. As my most recent reference point for electric shavers, I definitely miss this feature in the Braun Series 9 9095cc wet/dry model, and if you have sensitive skin, you will too. The Series 9 not only lacks the CoolTec feature, but - I was very surprised to find - the shaving head gets surprisingly warm during use. If you do have sensitive skin, particularly around the moustache and chin areas, this will not be a pleasant experience during a dry shave.SetupI found it easy to set up the Series 9 shaver, and went from opening the box to charging to first shave with a minimum of fuss. Braun produce excellent instruction manuals and I got the shaver up and running with the help of an accurate and fuss-free visual setup guide. It is worth taking the time later on to read the full instructions, particularly on cleaning the shaver.Look and feel of the shaverThe Series 9 is the lightest Braun shaver I have owned, but it feels substantial enough to reassure you that it won't skip over your face accidentally. The reflective silver case looks great at first, but easily gets smudged by being held a few times even with clean hands. The back of the shaver has a good  grippy surface, a function which contrasts nicely with the shiny form of the front.Using the shaverOne of the distinctive features of the Series 9 is the `MultiHeadLock' which lets you quickly and easily adjust the head to lock into 5 different settings. It took me two or three shaves to get used to this feature but it works well and is worth experimenting with to find the best setting for different parts of the face and neck. The trimmer, found on the back of the device, works very well on sideburns, and slides in and out easily. In keeping with the theme of convenience, the Series 9 is, in short, very easy to pick and use. I keep mine in its smart black protective travel case.Cleaning and chargingThe Series 9 comes with Braun's `Clean and Charge Station', quite a large docking station which will take up a sizeable chunk of your bathroom shelf, or another part of your home close enough to a wall socket. It works well and does what it promises, charging the shaver from empty to full in an hour, and providing a comprehensive clean (courtesy of the replaceable cleaning cartridge), before drying the shaver head. The cleaning process takes about 15 minutes and is best done straight after you have shaved. If you have small children, the cleaning station needs to be kept well out of reach, as the hazardous cleaning fluid can easily come out of the base of the cleaning station if the station is tipped over.The cleaning cartridges need replacing every three weeks if you use the shaver daily, and I learned from my previous Braun shaver that the fluid actually evaporates within about two months if for any reason you don't use the cleaning station regularly. The cartridges do need to be factored into the total cost of owning this shaver (as does replacing the foil after 18 months), but it is worth using them as they deliver a much more comprehensive clean than running the shaver under a tap.RecommendationI am happy to recommend the Series 9 as a dependable, smart looking and highly convenient electric shaver, with good battery life and high quality accessories. Despite the promise of various breakthrough technologies listed in the product description (e.g. 'Intelligent SynchroSonic technology' and `OptiFoilTM for perfect closeness') I cannot say that it delivers a significantly closer shave than other, older models I have used. If your skin is in any way sensitive, the heat generated by the Series 9 will quickly put you off. All of that said, if you know your way around electric shavers and understand the trade-off between convenience and closeness, the Series 9 is well worth a look.￼",4
3704,"This is most certainly the best shaver that I have ever used. The quality of the cut, whether it's a hasty Monday morning mow after a lazy weekend or an evening touch up before a night out, is unsurpassed.On that front it's absolutely recommended.Unfortuantely this particular unit has proven to be problematic and has been back to the (very well run) service centre in Nottingham three times. The same fault each time which is more than a little annoying.If you get a reliable one this shaver will last you a very long time. Fingers crossed!",4
3705,"This is my 3rd Oral B brush in a row, the batteries tend to die after a few years and can't be replaced.This is a little lighter than the previous ones. This doesn't come with a smart guide and is not compatible with the smart guide from my past 2 brushes. So I bought the updated smart guide (3742) from shavers.co.uk and that works fine. The smart phone app is gash, just penny pinching by Oral B.The case is actually a basic case and not the ""premium case"". The basic case is gash and went directly to bin.I recommend this brush.",4
3706,This is my best best vent holder ever.Doesn’t move around or fall off the way others have.,4
3707,"This is my second blind which I bought as I ripped the first (apparently when it says 'do not pull on the material to get the pads off the window' they mean it)  It is still fantastic at keeping the light out and my baby has a good night's sleep whenever I put it up, but the have changed the adjustment system.  It now has velcro tabs which you double the fabric over to make it shorter to fit different windows.  This means you have big folds in the fabric and can only adjust it in chunks (you could gather the old version up into little pleats).  I have eneded up putting the old one back up, with the rip, because I was able to make it fit the window better....",4
3708,"This is my second oral b toothbrush in the past few years, this one seems a little more powerful, absolutely delighted my one gripe is the rechargable battery lasts about 2 years and the brushes are not cheap so on average I would say it costs a little more than a good quality manuel toothbrush.",4
3709,"This is one of the oddest books I've read, in that I found it highly intriguing and enjoyable and gripping and yet sometimes annoying too. The chapters jump about in different time lines and are written from different characters' perspectives. This works to a point, but I often found myself at the start of a chapter flicking back to the start of the previous chapter to see if it was leading on in the same time frame or not. Sometimes it does, sometimes it skips a few days, sometimes it bizarrely skips forward a few days in one chapter and then back just a few again in the next, and sometimes it's 15 years. This is a clever way of unraveling a suspenseful story, but it also gets a bit annoying at times. Especially on a kindle!A couple of other reviews mention that it takes too long to find out why the central characters are scared, and I agree, at times you just think ""for heaven's sake get on with it, tell me!"" but overall it is still a very good story, mostly cleverly told. It is definitely unlike anything I've read before.",4
3710,This is really good.  It sticks to the windows with little suckers and expands to as big or small as you need.  We have a really tall window in my daughter's bedroom and it is the only thing we've found that has enough length to cover the whole window.It makes the room completely black and it stays on rather well.  The odd sucker comes unstuck every now and then but the whole thing doesn't come down.  Just have to re apply the sucker that came off every so often.Recommend highly,4
3711,"This is something of a deluxe package.  The equipment is will packed - you get quite a lot of stuff.  The main handle unit - mine is black and silver in colour  It has the main on/off button and a speed selection button on the front panel.  It also has blue indicator lights to show that bluetooth is in operation, and a three segment charge indicator.  You also get four slightly different heads, the charging stand (which has room to store the heads too), a plastic hard case to store the brush if in transit, and the digital timer/progress indicator screen (with a small stand).In practice the unit is comfortable in the hand and effective for cleaning.  It has some good features for example if you press too hard the lights on the unit flash red to warn you.  It also has an indicating pulse when certain times are reached.  So overall the cleaning is good.  Regarding the separate timer/progress screen, this was a bit of a fun element for a couple of days but to be honest it has barely been used since.  It might be a useful aid to encourage kids to brush more thoroughly though.  I find the battery lasts about a week, but does need a very long charge at first to get to full power (18 to 24 hours).  So why 4 starts and not 5?  Taking value into account, this is a better clean than a £40 brush from the same manufacturer, but not that much better, so you really need to be prepared to pay extra for a few bells and whistles, with the clean being slightly better than a much cheaper brush.",4
3712,"This is the absolute top of Braun's range of electric shavers - their topmost range is the Series 9 models, and this is the most expensive Series 9 shaver. It's a lot of money - I normally use a Wilkinson Sword Hydro razor, and even given the ridiculous price of shaving heads for that, you could buy 5 years worth of shaving heads for it for the cost of this shaver - so is it worth it?First off, I've always preferred Braun's horizontal cutters to the rotary version used by Philips, and I already own a Braun Series 7 shaver, which is pretty good, albeit still not quite as good as a wet shave. But a quick run of the 9095 across my face and I was staggered at the results - this is the first electric shaver I've used which I would say actually gives as close a shave as a blade. The head moves very smoothly with no pulling, tugging or irritation, and your skin feels great afterwards, and so smooth. This is the first electric shaver I have tried that I would seriously consider giving up wet shaving for.So it works really, really well. But it's still an awful lot of money - so what do you get? The shaver itself includes a head which either pivots freely or can be locked in one of 5 positions - I found leaving it to move freely worked fine. There is a short sideburn trimmer on the back; it's only about an inch long and slightly curved, so actually less useful than the trimmer on my Series 7, which is straight and a centimetre or so longer. The shaver itself feels comfortable in the hand, but it's really quite big. The shaving head itself is about 2cm across, with 4 separate floating shaving elements - a foil on each side and two trimmers for longer hairs in the middle. The shaver is fully waterproof and can be used wet or dry, and can be cleaned by being run under the tap or brushed clean. A full charge with the supplied travel charger takes around an hour, and provides 50 minutes of shave time, with a useful charge indicator on the front of the razor. A high quality zipped real leather case is included.The kit also includes Braun's ""Clean and Charge Station"", which circulates cleaning fluid through the razor and charges it up between shaves. This works really well at keeping the razor clean (and smelling great - the alcohol-based cleaning fluid is lemon-scented!) - you just stick the shaver in it when you're done, press the button, and an hour or so later, the razor is clean and dry and fully charged. The only problem with the cleaning station is the cost of the refill cartridges; a cartridge lasts around 3 weeks, and costs around a fiver - if you use these, you'll spend more on cleaning cartridges than you would on shaving heads for the most expensive system wet razors. Also, Braun recommend changing the shaving head itself every 18 months or so, which is another £40 a time.Overall, if you prefer to use an electric shaver, this is without doubt the best you can get; no question. But it's hugely pricey, both upfront and in cleaning cartridges if you choose to use them; it starts to make expensive wet shave system razors look like a cheap option. If money's no object, though, I'd recommend it without hesitation.",4
3713,"This is the accesoory filled Mercedes of the electric tooth brush world. Just opening the package is fun! Instructions are good (they need to be, since there are 4 brushes and 5 settings).The Bluetooth connectivity is a gimmick really - unless you are prepared to trust kids with something this expensive. LED smileys do NOT motivate me to brush my teeth more carefully. There is a separate clock/smiley generator which picks up how long and how well you clean.Bluetooth wears the battery down v fast, just like on your mobile. I turn it off every time I finish brushing -dead simple, and now automatic procedure. My old brush lasted a month. You could go down just to a week before recharging if using a lot of this brush's facilities - not so great on a 2 week holiday. There is also a red light that pervades the handle when you brush too hard. More useful, but anther drain on battery life. I realize that many people leave theirs plugged in all the time, but this is both  a waste and the source of noise. It is very low noise - but I CAN hear it. The prior brush was worse.The settings - too many. The brushes - too many, too clever. The 'polish' and milder ones seem pointless to a mere male like myself. The case - a great idea, very robust too. The stand - also excellent.",4

Makes for a perfect holiday read and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good story with some interesting and unexpected turns...",4
3715,This is the first electric Toothbrush I have bought and I love it! It came with a variety of heads to try and clear instructions. The battery is great and I very rarely have to charge it. It's made me realise how much I wasnt brushing properly. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush. The only reason I can't rate this as a 5 star is because the Bluetooth and brushing app was an anti climax. It's rather boring - sorry. Maybe I was expecting more?,4
3716,"This is the second model in Braun's top of the range Series 9 that I have tried. There are two wet+dry waterproof models, the 9095cc and this, the 9040s. The 9040s is slightly cheaper (but still rather expensive!) so I thought it would be useful to compare the two.As far as I can tell, the actual shaver is exactly the same in the two packages; the 9040s is in a rather more tasteful black and pale blue than the 9095cc's silver, but the shavers themselves are otherwise identical. They use the same shaving head, and I assume the same motor and battery, and seem to perform identically well too.I've always preferred Braun's horizontal cutters to the rotary version used by Philips, and I already own a Braun Series 7 shaver, which is pretty good, albeit still not quite as good as a wet shave.

The shaver itself feels comfortable in the hand, but it's really quite big. The shaving head itself is about 2cm across, with 4 separate floating shaving elements - a foil on each side and two trimmers for longer hairs in the middle. The shaver is fully waterproof and can be used wet or dry, and can be cleaned by being run under the tap or brushed clean. A full charge with the supplied travel charger takes around an hour, and provides 50 minutes of shave time, with a useful charge indicator on the front of the razor.This model does not include the 9095cc's clean and charge station (although it does have the relevant electrical contacts, so could probably be used in one), and instead of the 9095's real leather travel case, this includes a fabric one of the same design (which is probably actually more practical for use in a wet place like a bathroom). The display of remaining charge is a little less sophisticated on the 9040, lacking the 9095's 9 minute countdown to completely flat. You save around 25% on the cost of the 9095 for this.Interestingly, the 9040 claims to be usable with a shave gel or foam, which the 9095 does not - I suspect, given the similarity of the two shavers, this is down to something to do with the clean and charge station becoming contaminated by shave product residue.This is an excellent shaver; without a doubt the best electric shaver I have used and the only one which I would consider getting rid of my wet shaver for. But it's very expensive, even in this slightly cheaper version. Frankly, if I was spending this much on a shaver, I think I'd be inclined to find the extra for the 9095, as the clean and charge station is worth having. But if you can't quite stretch to that, this is definitely the next best option for a top of the line electric shaver.",4
3717,"This is the second time I have bought one of these as they really work quite well, the only downside is that no matter how well you think it's stuck on there have been occassions where you will wake up or be drifiting off to sleep and you'll hear it fall from one corner.It is however excellent at keeping the light out providing it stays stuck.",4
3718,"This is the sort of book that right-minded people take on holiday. It's a well-structured, well-paced and undemanding thriller. Granted, Ms Kelly plays by the rules, but where's the harm in that? You'll come to expect early on that there'll be at least one twist, because books like this always have to have one by law. At least in this case, the first twist is a good one, and if some of the others feel a bit tacked on, it's not enough to ruin the experience of getting to them. There is padding-the eclipse cruise sections add nothing to the plot-but books like this have to have padding to spare holidaymakers from the tedium of going on excursions to shoe factories on rainy days. For what it is, this is a fab book which does exactly what it needs to do and the characters are nowhere near as annoying as they are in Sophie Hannah's books. Stupidly, when I went on my recent transatlantic sojourn, I decided to take a rather dry biography of Henry IV instead. This is because I am an idiot. Downloading a copy of He Said, She Said, didn't stop me being an idiot, but it did mean the second week of my holiday passed more quickly than the first. Actually, with hindsight, that's probably not a good thing and, arguably, Ms Kelly owes me a few grand compo for her deft act of temporal manipulation but, because she's produced such an enjoyable read, I'll let her off.And note to publishers: when you're trying to shift copies of a gripping bestseller, don't give it the subtitle, 'the gripping Sunday Times bestseller with a shocking twist'. First, it should be for the reader to decide whether it's gripping or not and, second, if you tell people there's going to be a twist before they read the book, you'll spoil the surprise. Admittedly, I've done it above, but that's my right as a pseudonymous internet reviewer.",4
3719,"This is unlike any other psychological thriller I’ve read and I’ve read a lot of psychological thrillers. The book is about a couple, Laura and Kit, who are eclipse chasers and who during one of their trips to watch an eclipse in Cornwall in 1999 chance upon the aftermath of a rape. Being the only witnesses, they have to call the police and so begins the long and protracted case of whether Jamie raped Beth.The book alternates between Laura and Kit’s viewpoints and a series of flashbacks. These are very well done and rather than leaving the reader confused, as with some books I’ve read that follow this format, they show us a complex picture of flawed characters, all fighting for their own survival.This is not a thriller that hurtles along at breakneck speed, twisting and turning every which way, but instead the tension is built slowly and ingeniously and the twists are clever and unexpected. One particular twist caught me so off guard that I gasped out loud with surprise,Over all, this is a thought-provoking book that slowly peels back its many layers and will make you ask yourself whose version of the truth you believe.I definitely recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Erin Kelly’s books soon.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for their ARC.",4
3720,this is xmas gift it looks like a good product/reviews are good as well,4
3721,This item did exactly what it said.I had read other reviews in which buyers complained that the grips would regularly fall down.This is not the case if correctly removed and applied. I would recommend this product.,4
3722,This item is very good it does a good job. Thanks Oral B,4
3723,This item was good for the time I had it. It is perfect for those who are looking to pump occasionally and not too fussed about the size and convenience. I eventually went for something else as I wanted to pump more regularly. Otherwise a decent item would recommend for mums who want to pump once in a while! Good price too compared to others on the market.,4
3724,"This oral-b brush gives a lovely clean and you can really feel that your teeth are ""squeaky"" clean after you use it!  The pulse timer goes off every 30 seconds so that you know to move on to the next section of teeth.  (It surprised me that I felt I needed a bit longer than 30 seconds though - I end up spending longer than the recommended 2 minutes on my teeth now!).As with all of these Oral-b brushes they eventually seem to loose their charge very quickly, for this reason I'm not sure they offer great value for money if you choose the expensive models...",4
3725,This product does what it Saids only ish is that the Velcro lets in light so I've stretched the suckers across so no need to use the Velcro but a little bit of light isn't the biggest deal when 95% is dark :) am thinking about buying another and the suckers are fine hold on to the window even when it's windy and window open,4
3726,"This product is better than the Mpow magnetic car mount I bought then returned(my view only).Item is compact, light, tightly fit into the A/C blade. Bilateral clip allows enough extension for bigger screen phone.Limitation:1. The stalk is too short, once the car mount is fitted to A/C blade, you can NOT place your phone perpendicular to the road/floor, and in a sunny day, it can be a problem when the sunlight reflected to your eyes and you can't see your mobile phone screen clearly, I am only point this out because I use google map as GPS when driving. Wearing a sunglasses will help.2. The depth of clips can be deeper. It does not clip well when using a flip case and you fold the cover backwards, in my case, I can not manage to maintain a good grip, when there is a bump one the road, the phone WILL drop, although this does not happen very often, but its good enough to be a worry.Overall I am quite happy with the product hence four star.",4
3727,"This product is very good and better that the clamps are made of good quality rubber. The only thing is if you have a bigger case (charging case), then you would notice the phone comes out unexpectedly.",4
3728,This pump is easy to use. There are quite a lot of parts to it but once I'd put it together once I'd got the hang of it.I sterilise it using my microwave steriliser and I've also been able to attach some other brands of bottle to it (mam).It didn't fit the tommee tippee bottle that I tried with it though - it came with 1 lansinoh bottle anyway so I didn't really need the other bottles.It's a really efficient pump and I was amazed at how quick it was compared to the manual pump I'd been using - I was quite happy with the manual pump but looking back I wish I'd had this from the start.Definitely worth investing in.,4
3729,"This read certainly has quite a few surprises in store for readers. I liked the concept, perhaps because it is a hot topic and a core setting people really need to take on board.To be perfectly frank I think the author could have kept the plot as the simple he said/she said scenario and still delivered a thought provoking read. As it stands it evolved from whether a rape actually happened, to a story with the tense undertones of a psychological thriller.With that in mind I actually enjoyed the read, but wasn’t as enthralled with the ending. I liked the way Kelly drew the story out and created this shadow of doubt around every single character, but was especially interested in the way Beth was perceived.I know other reviewers found the whole eclipse sub-plot a little tiresome, however I felt it was an intriguing way to show how predictable we are and how easy it is to find someone in this day and age. We leave behind huge digital footprints, so big that they can be followed by anyone with the most basic digital skills.I felt as if the crux of the plot was how easily Laura was eventually swayed in her opinion of the event. Her instincts told her what was happening, and she called Jamie out for what he was, a rapist. Then suddenly it only takes a trickle of a doubt for her to question what she saw with her own eyes.Kelly makes some very valid points about rape. The victim is almost always shamed and blamed, whilst the perpetrator is treated like an innocent person in the middle of a set-up to destroy their lives. Even when there are eye-witness statements, it seems as if the victims always have the scales of justice weighted heavily against them.Kelly does an excellent job of sewing the seeds of doubt in this story. Before you know it a certainty becomes a maybe, and then you may start to question not just the one person who needs the support, but also everyone in her vicinity.Oh and by the way, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is probably a duck. Just saying.*I received an ARC/free copy of this book courtesy of the publisher via NetGalley.*",4
3730,"This replaced an earlier model that became noisy and less effective. It is slimmer in the hand but it lacks the closeness adjuster of the other one. Perhaps there is an even more expensive version that has this feature but it wasn't easy to tell this from the product detail. I prefer the display of the earlier one because it's visible when it's switched off, whereas this has a column of illuminated bars that can only be seen when it's on. The charger/cleaner holds the razor less securely and seems to use the fluid up more quickly. I've also had to replace the head already because one of the cutter bars kept popping out - though I'm not aware that it was dropped or something similar. So overall a mixed bag but it shaves well.",4
3731,"This replaces our old Triumph version of pretty much the same toothbrush, but clearly Oral-B have used the time well, because there are some features that are a definite improvement:- The actual quality of toothbrushing is improved - and that's what you're actually buying this thing for.- The smiley-face remote unit is smaller, partly because it uses AAA instead of AA batteries.So why is it downvoted one star?  The Bluetooth feature.  I have learned that there are two kinds of Bluetooth devices - those that pair reliably and work as you would hope, and all the others.  And this toothbrush is definitely in the latter category.  I've tried the Android app on my Nexus 5 and the iPad app, and both are frustrating and in my opinion pointless.  The idea that I will give an app permanent access to the microphone on my iPad is insane.  In the post-Snowden era it's not just conspiracy theorists who are starting to think a little more cautiously about who they share intimate personal information with.",4
3732,"This shaver arrives in a large box with its large 'cleaning station' and fluid, mains connector, small brush, and good quality case for the shaver. There's also a good multi-lingual paper instruction manual. The mains connector ends in a two-pin plug so if, like me, you're charging it from a standard mains socket you will need a shaver adaptor. The shaver took less than an hour to fully charge. There is a visual indicator to show how the shaver is charging. Much of the weight of this hefty shaver is probably due to the battery and I would expect it to last a long time; my current electric shaver (Braun Series 5) lasts about three weeks on one charge. The shaver, which is made in Germany, feels well-built and has a two year warranty.The quality of shave was very good indeed. I like the way the head moves to accommodate most of the curves on your skin.  But to be honest, it's still not quite as good a shave as that obtained with a blade razor. I'm not sure an electric ever will match a blade. Everyone's skin/ hair growth is different, some will find this better than others.Braun recommend you use the cleaning station after each shave, but I find this too much of a faff and you can clean the cutting head under running warm water, which I find is fine.One thing I miss is a cover for the cutting foil for when the shaver's not in use.  My old Braun Series 5 came with one, and I am amazed that there is no cover supplied with this expensive model; it would be very easy to damage the foil cutting head.  Or perhaps they just forgot to put one in the box?  There is no reference to a cover in the booklet.So, overall a very good shaver giving a very good shave. But it's at quite a price, and I'm not convinced the cleaning station is an essential item.",4
3733,"This shaver is very gentle on your face compared to the 7 series predecessor, I've used it for a while now and so far I've never felt it yank a hair out, and it's caused no skin irritation at all (something that would happen every so often with the 7 series).  The cleaning fluid carts seem to last a lot longer than the 7 series cleaner too, which is a bonus as they can get quite pricey.Having said that, it does also seem to take longer to get a shave of a given closeness than it did to get an equivalent shave out of a series 7.  Additionally, the actual shaving head is pretty huge which makes getting to areas like under your lip awkward.It's a good buy at the below £200 price point Amazon are selling at.  At the £329 RRP I'd have far more reservations about recommending it.",4
3734,"This shaver was put through its paces in this house by a confirmed wet shave/razor user of several decades. At the end of using it for a little while he pronounced it as ""almost"" as good as a razor shave, and it's still being used every other day as part of his normal regime instead of his trusty non-electric razor . The shaver has lots of positives, and a few things to consider, the first undoubtedly being the investment needed in buying one in the first place. This is not a cheap product, but it does have lots of good features which may or may not make it worth the rrp depending on your requirements from a shaver. This one certainly has good looks, is nicely made, charges really quickly, is easy to use and is more or less self cleaning. Ownership does also involve running costs which should also be considered - you will have to buy cartridges every months or so if you want to use the cleaning function on the base.Out of the box the first thing you notice is that the charger/cleaning station requires quite a lot of space in the bathroom. Ours is kept in a cupboard and removed for use - you need to be able to access a shaving point for the plug. I've added a picture of the plug because it's HUGE. You attach it straight to the shaver to charge or to the charging station if you want to use it. As it happens it's fine in our shaving point but I could see it struggling in more confined plugs, for example in a hotel. A plus is that the shaver charges in 50 mins, as billed, and you get a good deal of shaving time from that.The shaver itself is, without a doubt, really nicely engineered. The back is made of really soft and grippy plastic and all the details are chrome, or chrome finish. The head is lockable and another nice feature is the mini sideburn cutter that pops out cleverly from the main body of the shaver.In use it works really well and it's good that you can choose to have the head fixed or not. The on/off button can be locked for transport and you also get a very swanky carry case to put the shaver in for trips away. Mr A to Z found his skin was left well shaved and that it was pain free - no nicks or cuts, though until he got used to using it he did experience some sensitivity. It does remove all the hairs you want to - I would advise watching the video tutorial on the Braun website for insight into use.After use the head can be washed under a tap or, easier still, set to wash in the charging station. This is not a whisper quiet or quick operation but, through using a cartridge which seems to contain scent and alcohol, the head is left dry, clean and ready to use. It's hassle free, though not without expense as the cartridges need to be replaced - there will be a running cost.This is is a high end shaver, which is an indulgence to own. It's not perfect, but it's been pretty well received here where it faced quite harsh judgement. Overall then, recommended if in your price range.",4
3735,"This style of writing, a bit Gone Girl, I can find annoying but it worked here. This is a captivating book about solar eclipses, rape, revenge and relationships. Told in alternative chapters by the two protagonists it keeps you pretty well glued to the page with the required twists and turns. It's a book about honesty at the end of the day and being true to yourself.",4
3736,"This system - you can't really just call it a toothbrush! - has got to be a cut above anything that I have ever used before. It looked a bit daunting at first but the instructions were clear and I soon got into the swing of things. I like the choice of brush heads to suit the type of cleaning, my particular favourite is the crosshead brush.  I really can feel that the surface of my teeth is smooth and free from plaque etc.  After using the whitening brush I could really see that stains were less noticeable - as a coffee drinker I'm aware that my habit is not good for my teeth but my teeth are definitely whiter now. I have also enjoyed using the Bluetooth timer and app. I haven't used the app every day but I like the encouragement that it gives you. It's great fun!  The timer is great for reminding you when to stop and start cleaning different areas of the mouth. The only reason I haven't given this a complete 5 star review is that it is rather noisy which is not ideal when cleaning teeth at bedtime and not wanting to disturb others! However this is a minor matter and didn't really detract from my opinion of the brush. I think that using this brush has really shown up that I wasn't cleaning my teeth thoroughly enough before but hopefully this has now changed - I wonder if my dentist will agree?",4
3737,this tablet is very good my son is very happy. it has included shows for kids and the 2 year warranty for peace of the mind.,4
3738,"This tooshbrush is really good, it does a great job at cleaning. I think it's a bit over the top though. I had a feeling that it would be the case but I am a real gadget freak so thought the bluetooth would be cool to have but honestly I have only used it about two times then the novelty wore off. The wireless SmartGuide is kinda cool and useful, I do use that. One irritating thing is that when you change the brushing modes, it doesn't remember your selection and it defaults back to it's standard setting so you have to change it every single time which becomes really irritating. Overall great toothbrush though.",4
3739,"This toothbrush amazes me at how advanced technology has came, the fact that you can connect it to your iPhone via an app and track your brushing is amazing.  The clock/timer gadget not only is great for use with the toothbrush but works as an everyday clock in the bathroom.  So far I've only used the whitening head but find it makes my teeth feel clean compared to other brand electric toothbrushes but the added too much pressure function makes me realise I've been brushing too hard all my life, the fact the toothbrush flashes to notify you is a great bonus so you don't have to rely solely on the app or timer gadget. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is a find the battery doesn't last I've charged it for ages and am yet to get a full charge.",4
3740,"This toothbrush comes with a lot of extras and thus takes a little bit of setting up. Along with the toothbrush and charger you also receive 4 different toothbrush heads (cross-action, floss-action, whitening and sensitive), a case to hold the heads, a case to hold the toothbrush and the smart guide which connects via blue-tooth.  The smart guide is like a little clock which tells you how long you have been brushing for and tells you which section of your mouth to be brushing. However after the first few times of use I got bored of the gimmick as the brush itself tells you when to move on to each section of brushing as it is set into 30 second segments with a little flash and buzz when it is time to change. I also linked up my iPhone via the Oral B app via blue-tooth but again did not really see the necessity of this as it just tells you how long you have been brushing. It also tells you if you have put too much pressure on whilst brushing and for how long but again the brush minimises the need for the app as the brush flashes red if you apply too much pressure. The app also reminds you to clean your tongue, floss and use mouthwash but overall I really don't think it is necessary to warrant an app for cleaning your teeth.Overall the Oral B toothbrush is a high-quality product which certainly helps keep your mouth clean. However I have found the 'added-extras' on offer here are really not needed and just add to the extortionate price. I would recommend other Oral-B electric toothbrushes along with my previous Philips Sonicare toothbrush too.",4
3741,"This toothbrush does make your teeth feel cleaner than normal (than with my old oral b), but personally I am finding that the Bluetooth connection is not worth it. You have to have your phone by you, connected to wifi and with the app open in order for it to collect data. I'm finding I'm not bothering with that very often and because it needs to collect 30 days of data before you get any analysis, I am not seeing the benefit. Battery life seems very good, and my teeth feel great, but I wouldn't pay over the odds for the Bluetooth feature again.",4
3742,This toothbrush is easy to set up and a pleasure to use. I like the clock which makes sure you brush for sufficient time.,4
3743,"This toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh no matter what toothpaste I use.  The speed of the rotating brush head seems to be at the optimum speed on the daily clean mode for removing plaque and making my teeth feel smooth.  I have used the tongue cleaning mode and find it good, but perhaps could be a little more thorough?  The app is useful and I tried the various programmes, but it brought up a warning that it was making my phone run slowly so I may have to uninstall it?  Also, I was concerned about getting my phone wet by keeping it nearby when brushing.  However, I really liked the wireless smart guide that you can put on the wall which shows you which areas to brush and for how long.  The recharge frequency seemed to be much longer than my previous electric toothbrush.  I'm not sure that I will use all of the different modes.  I haven't had a visit to the dentist yet so have not applied a dentist recommended programme.  All in all, an effective toothbrush for a sparkling smile to give a thorough clean.",4
3744,This toothbrush make you teeth feel dentist clean. Its heavier than the standard old Oral B but it fits nicely in the hand and the battery lasts a long time. It comes with several different heads so you can find your own personal favourite. It also has a timer that connects to your phone via bluetooth. It shows you on screen if you are brushing long enough and hard enough. Completes complete with charger and travel case.,4
3745,This toothbrush was a great replacement for my older electric one. I can really feel the difference in the clean. The bluetooth stuff is a bit gimmicky but I guess thats what the kids are after these days.,4
3746,"This was a great read.  It was slow to start with but was so compelling and really kept me guessing until the end.

A splendid kit for either starting out with electric toothbrushes or replacing or upgrading from previous models or other brands, this set has the lot including a fun/useful Bluetooth enabled screen and available app to enable you to track and guide you to better brushing.I don't usually compare against other products but I do normally use a Sonicare and this applies to you, the Oral B is bigger in diameter (bigger battery), slightly heavier and much noisier in use but none of this detracts particularly as a stand alone product of its type, more of an observation.I've reviewed the black version, as you can imagine it does show up toothpaste residue more but that means it is also easier to keep it clean looking. Included with this set are 4 different brush heads (Cross-action, Floss-action, 3D White and Sensitive Clean) and a plastic travel carry-case. This will take the handle unit and two brush heads.A good clean, fun to use and intelligent in simple ways. The brush head will slow if pressing too hard and a red light will flash and warn you if you go harder still as well as a grumpy face on the monitor.

3769,"Undoubtedly, this is a top-notch toothbrush that leaves the mouth feeling really clean after you use it, it comes with 4 different brush heads (floss, 3D, sensitive, trizone) and has 6 different cleaning modes and at the present time on Amazon it's 62% off RRP (£88.23) and at this price or near enough, I recommend it. But to buy it at the full price (£229.99), I think you would need to have more money than sense.It's also a toothbrush with Bluetooth capability and will connect with your Smartphone (you can see a good demonstration on You Tube) trouble is, I'm a Windows phone user and there isn't yet an App for me, it's only for Android or IOS, no Microsoft. That said, the Wireless SmartGuide still works without it so I don't feel I'm missing out and I doubt I would use it anyway (I'd rather save the phone battery). However, I think for others, especially youngsters, this feature could be a very helpful way of getting them to maintain good dental hygiene.Tooth brushing sure has come a long way since I was a kid and if you can pick one of these up for the current price I would say go for it, your teeth will thank you for it in the end (because you'll still have them).",4

3773,"Using the natural phenomenon of a solar eclipse as a metaphor, Kelly's latest novel tackles the difficult subject of a rape case. Laura and Kit, a couple who 'chase' eclipses, travel to Cornwall in 1999 to witness the eclipse there. Whilst they are there, Laura stumbles into a quiet area where she finds a man and a woman. Laura is sure of what she sees; he is raping the woman. The man, Jamie says she has just interrupted consensual sex; the woman, Beth, says nothing. As Kit also then comes across what is happening, Laura and Kit end up as witnesses to a trial. But, when she is in the witness box, Laura makes one lie. And, after the trial, Beth won't seem to leave them alone...It is hard to say any more about this novel's plot without giving too much away. Kelly tells the tale through the voices of Laura and Kit; with both of them flitting between the present and the past. At the very beginning of the book, we are also aware that they are both living in fear of Beth although we do not know why. As their past unfolds, it sheds light on their future, explaining why they are so changed from the people who we encounter in Cornwall, back in '99.As with any thriller, as you would expect, there are plenty of twists and turns along the way. The chapters are short, another device often used within this genre, keeping the pace of the tale going. As the title suggests, the main focus of the tale, and the reason for the eclipse as a metaphor, is that the tale purposefully makes you question who you should believe in regards to what really happened in '99.Overall, I did enjoy this book. It  definitely kept me reading it; I found myself opening it up whenever I got the chance. The reason that I have only awarded 4 stars is that, working within this area, I realised there were some fairly minor flaws to the tale (irritating to someone who can spot them, but perhaps not so bad otherwise). One of these was the time-frame of the offence taking place and then the court case date. It was less than a year between it being reported and then the court case; in reality, this can be much longer, well over a year. The second was the time-frame described for Laura to receive counselling via the NHS. She was facing a six week waiting time (she lives in London). Again, this is completely laughable. For someone waiting to receive counselling from the NHS, they are often looking at months rather than weeks. The final thing, which if I am right is a larger mistake, is that Beth comments on Sapphire's response to her as a rape victim; but, Beth was raped in 1999. I could be wrong, and I have tried to check this information on-line before reviewing this novel, but I don't think Sapphire was around in 1999. One on-line piece of information I found stated that the first Sapphire team began in 2003/04 (The Benefits of Police Specialist Rape Teams - Nicole Westmarland). If this is right, this is a pretty glaring mistake.Other than these flaws, this is a well written, fast paced thriller which doesn't shy-away from a difficult subject.",4
3774,"Using this in the summer changed my toddler's wake time from 5.30am to 7.30am, so it was worth its weight in gold for us!The window we apply it to is much smaller than the blind, so there's a lot of extra fabric and while the velcro is a good idea for resizing, it's not as neat a solution as I thought it would be. Zips might be better, but I expect that would shoot the price up. However, it still works brilliantly, so I'm happy.",4
3775,Vary good,4
3776,Very clever story-line.  Realistic characters who get themselves into serious difficulties.,4
3777,Very comfortable shave during shower!,4
3778,"Very complex, where do people get these ideas from...took a long time to get to the point of being interesting.",4
3779,"Very detailed, unpredictable plot. Kept the reader completely engaged. Characters well thought out and convincing.Recommended read for long journeys, holidays.",4
3780,Very different story but with interesting twists and turns.  Became an absolute page turner which hurtled you to the end,4
3781,Very easy to use and does what is says very professional clean,4
3782,Very easy to use and feels like it wont break easily. It held my LG G5 securely and does not slip or slide going over bumps in the road.,4
3783,Very easy to use but you need to charge it for a while before use it.,4
3784,"Very effective product, but the Bluetooth panel seems an unnecessarily complicated addition.  The brushes all seem to work well and the battery on mine has not drained especially quickly, although it doesn't last as long as my old Oral B toothbrush.",4
3785,Very effective we used this our flat and it was a godsend to allow our two small boys to sleep during the day. If you cannot fit a proper blackout curtain then this is ideal. Some of the suction cups (maybe one or two) seem to have lost this ability to stick onto the window but the blind it fairly lightweight so it stays in place. Just make sure you check your window size before ordering.,4
3786,Very enjoyable but so many twists and turns at the end and could sort of see some of them coming.,4
3787,"Very enjoyable, total page turner. Twists I didn't see coming. Great book",4
3788,Very exciting book.  Full of surprise turns in the story.  Shows how strangely people behave in fear of being found out.,4
3789,"Very good - although not sure I need Bluetooth connectivity (no, I still haven't bothered with the app!)",4
3790,Very good bit disapointed didn't come with a plug ?,4
3791,"Very good blind, stopped my son from waking at 4am this summer! only downside is that it doesn't let much air through if you have the window open on a hot night but I don't think there's anything they can do about that",4
3792,Very good book.  I enjoyed it from the beginning.  It keeps you hooked.,4
3793,Very good book. The twists and turns keep you engaged. Only bad point is a few times it was predictable BUT this didn't take away from the story in the slightest. I read this in about 4 days it was that gripping! Well worth a read.,4
3794,Very good couldn't put it down,4
3795,"Very good device, loaded with a lot of interesting games, programmes and books for children, Kids loved it. Slightly slow but not a noticeable problem. Good value for money and a recommended purchase. Excellent delivery service from Amazon, free within 48 hours.",4
3796,Very good Does exactly what is states,4
3797,"Very good for the kids with easy functions. hard to get back to the home screen sometimes and not as easy to use as an apple product. however nice and small, good cause, very reasonably priced so great for kids to watch cartoons on.",4
3798,"Very good product and a good price, the toothpaste is disgusting though.",4
3799,Very good product. Disappointing that the product came with an inappropriate plug.I had to take a charger from an old product so I could use the new product,4
3800,"very good pump, easy to put together and use. I ordered the tommee tippee one which was rubbish so I decided to try this one. I would give it five stars however for myself I feel it could be a bit more powerful, but that's just me.",4
3801,Very good quality,4
3802,"very good quality, and very sturdy when mounted on an air vent. However my only gripe is it is not very slick and easy to place the phone and remove it from the holder it could do with a release button. You have to hold the mount with two hands and use one of them to pry open the grips to insert the phone and the same with removing the phone.It doesn't release easily or slide out you have to pry open the jaws and lift the phone out.",4
3803,"Very good quality, I love it. The fact that it can be connected to a smartphone was quite interesting for the first month but then I realized it was a waste of time. I have never used the clock as the toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds and at the end of brushing. It is a good toothbrush but, for less money, you can buy an older version that does the same thing but doesn't have that many accessories.",4
3804,Very good quality. Arrived well packaged and very quickly. As described.,4
3805,Very good read and twist in the end,4
3806,"Very good read.  Not the sort of book I would normally enjoy, but the twists are excellent",4
3807,Very good read. Couldn't guess what would happen. Very well written. Would definitely buy other books by this author.,4
3808,Very good st blocking out light but sometimes falls off the window in the night as sticky pads difficult to attach perfectly.,4
3809,Very good story,4
3810,Very good storyline. I wonder how authors make these things up.  Lots of twists. Will definitely read more by this author,4
3811,Very good tablet for kids. It’s a little bit challenging to operate by my 2 yr old due to the transition from iPad to android. Apps and kid vids can be hard to find. Unable to download kid tube app as this is the app my 2yr old prefers. In all a good table but needs time to get use to.,4
3812,"Very good toothbrush doe,s everything as the maker claims. good battery life, very good service from the supplier",4
3813,"Very good toothbrush, but Ivery not used the Bluetooth.  Personally I think it's a gadget too far and a waste of time.  Got it at a very good price and love the ""clean"" feel from it, but would not have paid a higher price to get a gimmick.",4
3814,Very good toothbrush. They work at optimal level for about 2 years when used in a house hold of 4 but having had a few different types of electronic toothbrush this make is the best I have had.,4
3815,"Very good, although the Android app is quite buggy",4
3816,"Very good, light weight, proper secure cover and very easy to useI bought this for my son’s fifth birthday and he’s really happy with it",4
3817,"Very good.  It has fitted onto the 3 cars that I've tried it with.  I like the fact that it takes all of the 3 phones I've tried it with, so I shouldn't need to buy another car mount when I get a new phone in a couple of years",4
3818,Very good. Battery doesnt last forever between charges (not convinced it would last you a holiday away from the charger) hence the 4 stars.,4
3819,Very good. Battery small capacity.,4
3820,very good. but battery life not that long,4
3821,Very good. Many modes to use. Well made.,4
3822,Very good. The app is a bit unnecessary though.,4
3823,Very gripping,4
3824,Very gripping story. The tension was built up  slowly and the ending a complete turnaround. A must read for anyone who likes a real pageturner.,4
3825,Very happy with it,4
3826,Very happy with my purchase but one complaint.  There should be at least 6 replacement heads for the toothbrush when taking into concern the money spent on this item.,4
3827,Very happy with the product but you would of thought for that price it shud of been a uk plug,4
3828,"Very happy with the product, I have used the blind several times while on holiday to keep my baby daughters room dark in the summer evenings so she could sleep. It was easy to put up on and is a good size",4
3829,Very happy with the tablet. I removed one star as my daughter got it for Xmas when we were in UK. What we have learned later is that the free 1 year of kids stuff that is like subscription only works in UK and as we are leaving in Ireland we can't get that. Was disappointed but with my next wisit in London I activated the content and downloaded apps on tablet now my daughter uses them in Ireland but not great workaround if you ask me.,4
3830,"Very happy with this item, the seller and the delivery . thank you.",4
3831,"Very nice material, they look like good quality-made. The only problem is with the suction cups, some of them keep on falling.",4
3832,Very nice shave mashin but if your face hair is a hard one is dificult when grow up little more. The results are not the way you want....,4
3833,Very nice.,4
3834,Very pleased with electric toothbrush and a good price,4
3835,Very pleased with the toothbrush. Would recommend,4
3836,"very pleased, good all round cleaning system.",4
3837,"very pleased, my wife is a happy bunny",4
3838,Very pretty but a bit small.,4
3839,Very quick service and a great toothbrush,4
3840,Very simple but it works,4
3841,Very simple pump with not too many buttons to get used to. Easy to put together.Negatives...the plug makes a ringing sound when plugged in which is really annoying!! Unsure if mine is faulty or not and the actual pump is a little noisy.,4
3842,"Very sweet, smaller than I thought they would be , great value.",4
3843,"Very useful product which allows me to use my phone as a satnav while driving. Fits really easily onto the air vent (I have a Toyota Yaris) and easy to see while driving. Also really easy to take off when not using and only small to store. The only problem I've found is that you do get reflection of the phone screen on the windscreen when using at night due to the angle, but on my car it's right at the top of the windscreen so doesn't obscure my vision. And obviously your phone does block the airvent a bit so you don't get quite as much blow (although this does keep your phone nice and cool!).",4
3844,very useful!,4
3845,"Wanted something to stop our 16 month old playing with our ipad and needed to be robust, this fits the bill perfectly.Not bad value, screen resolution good but dont expect ipad type clarity. Perfect for the kids tough.Does freeze up now and again which needs a restart but not unlike any other device, battery life is good at the moment.Plenty of free apps to keep them amused, im now an expert on in the night garden and telletubbies!",4
3846,Was a bit skeptical about spending so much on a tooth brush but I would say it is worth it!,4
3847,Was a good book and agree with other reviews that it was hard to put down. Just thought that the concept of the book was big but the ending was a bit disappointing,4
3848,Was bought as a gift; recipient says it is very good and meets expectations.,4
3849,Was very big when opened fully and quite heavy so wouldn't stick to window with suction pads. Had to use velcro sections round the curtain pole. Returned anyway as made no difference to my sons early waking although did keep room dark.,4
3850,"Wasn't sure about this after reading some of the reviews. Bought for my Grandson, six months old, who was coming to stay and needed his bedroom to be in darkness. The sucker type fixings held up well and the fact that it can be altered in size is really good. I recommend it.",4
3851,"We are taken along in the flow of events, not even thinking that maybe what we hear is true. I felt frustration more than once when the main female befriends the one causing all the trouble. However a twist in the tale and things are not as they seem.Keeps you guessing to the end.",4
3852,We bought this for our granddaughter and she loves it,4
3853,"We bought this for our holiday as our Son has a tendency to wake at the crack of dawn! The blind itself is huge, making it great for most windows and attaches using suction cups. It can be a little fiddly, but once you've got it sorted, it will stay up & blacks out the room entirely. Amazingly, you can fit it back into its small pouch afterwards too! 4 stars due to its fiddliness!",4
3854,We had some trouble with the delivery but ir was sorted out. The product is brilliant and helped a lot!,4
3855,"we had to buy a blackout material mostly for my 2 yrs old daughter not been able to sleep with too much light in the room, since we have received it now she sleeps every day  until 0830 :)",4
3856,"We have a 15 month old who is very hyper, and cannot sit still even when she's eating. Whether we are at home, or in a restaurant, this has been a life saver. My only qualm would be that certain items aren't available and you have to buy them separately.",4
3857,We have a 4 month old daughter who would wake once it starts getting light but with the blackout blind she's been sleeping till 8/9am. A good product that keeps out the light. The suckers will stick eventually.,4
3858,we have just purchased this fire because the one we got for our 6 year old grandson let him get on utube through Nickelodeon umizoomi.Amazon were not bothered that the 6year old got onto a Porn site. we had to pay for a new one with the promise of a refund. not what I would expect for such a serious flaw in their fire.  PLEASE DO NOT THINK YOUR CHILD IS SAFE KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.,4
3859,We have kindle fires already and the kids have had them. Old ones didn't have enough storage (8gb) the new 8 inch has 32gb which is a lot better. I know you expand storage with a memory card but some things wont install on the card. I returned 1st one as the web content would not load on kids profile. We had enabled the browser in settings of course.  Talked to amazon help and nobody could sort it. The replacement is the same. I have done 3 updates to get to version 3.6 and left it on standby overnight and content has magically appeared. It now lets me add approved websites and videos through adult settings as well as amazon chosen web content. Everyone I know with a new kids kindle is having same problem so I hope tech people read this.,4
3860,"We have two of these - one for travels and the other for use at home. It is winter now so we have taken this down in the nursery but during the brighter nights and mornings this helped keep our daughter from waking early, and helped her go to sleep at her usual bedtime.Its easy to fit onto the window directly and with some moisture(bit of saliva on the sticky bit) will stay up there for a long time. I would highly recommend that all parents have one of these at hand especially if your nursery/kids room is sun facing first thing or in the evening, and also for travels to a sunny climate.",4
3861,"We have wide window frames which means light comes in from the edges, and also it can be awkward if you need to open the windows it covers. It's makes the room dark enough, but just a couple of little issues.",4
3862,"We tested it on a teenager first time shaver - and he managed a pretty clean shave, with no skin irritation,  without ever having picked up a shaver before - so pretty easy to use. 'Feels satisfying', he said. The trimmer is a neat item - for a straight edge to sideburns and even, in skilled hands, a bit of eyebrow trimming!Charges quickly. We got going with this test after just a few minutes charging.",4
3863,"We were recommended the gro blind by a friend as our daughter has started waking up at 4.30am with the light which is a nightmare! We've only had it a few days and so far so good. Shuts out the light nicely. First night it did fall down but I don't think we pressed the suction cups onto the window properly/hard enough and it hasn't fallen down since. Yesterday morning she slept until 6:30am (usual normal time for her to wake) and then this morning she slept until 7:15, which never happens! Very impressed. Good price and fast delivery.",4
3864,"Well it's an electric toothbrush and it works like all toothbrushes before it. One criticism: when I ordered it, the box on the photos looked like metal and it was black, what I received was see through and plastic. Not cool amazon, not cool.",4
3865,Well liked by 3 year old,4
3866,Well made and can cope with thicker or thinner mount points. May not be entirely suitable for the round vents on some Ford models as they swivel and have a greater round of movement. I found myself straightening the phone during journeys.,4
3867,Well made with good protection. My only gripe is the inability to access Amazon Prime video while overseas. This will not be an issue for most people though.,4
3868,Well plotted and plenty to think about aftewards!,4
3869,Well what can I say about this electric toothbrush. It changed the way in which I brush my teeth & it feels like a professional tooth brush. The battery life seems to be between 7 & 10 days compared to my old oral b 3000 that started to barely last 5 days!,4
3870,Well written and easy to read.  Kept me in suspense wondering how it was going to turn out in the end - slightly disappointed but would still recommend reading it.  Makes me wonder if there will be sequel.,4
3871,Well written and keeps you guessing right until the end. Good plot and characters are believable. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.,4
3872,"Well written, interesting twist",4
3873,Well written. Good insight to a disturbing topic.,4
3874,Well written. The writing was so good I felt uncomfortable reading but had to carry on. Glad I did. It suddenly turned in a direction I never expected.  I was held captive until the end,4
3875,"Well, the smart function isn’t available for Windows so that’s a feature I won’t be able to experience for now.  I’ve used electric toothbrushes for a number of years now and have always found Oral-B to be consistently good in terms of quality and performance.This toothbrush enhances existing features and has one or two others which may or may help you depending on your point of view.  Most electrical toothbrushes will give you a buzz at 30 second intervals, which helps determine how long you should be spending cleaning each section of your mouth.  You’ve now also got a visual smiley face on the unit you can stick in your bathroom which may help.  The toothbrush unit will also warn you visually and audibly if you are applying too much pressure.There are four heads, including sensitive, whitening and gum care.  The replacement heads aren’t too expensive if you shop-around.  At a little over £80, this toothbrush more sensibly priced now.  Gimmicks aside, this is a quality product that performs better than any other electric toothbrush I’ve owned.  There are ‘brushes out there that will give comparable performance for less £; but as a package, I think this is recommended purchase.",4
3876,"Well, we managed to change the wake up time to start with a 6 or even a 7 on these lighter mornings.  So I would call this a result.  Had no problem with the blind suckers staying on the windows.  Great to know it can travel with us as it is a must to pack now when staying away.",4
3877,"What starts out as a thoughtful story about rape, non-consent and different subjective views of the same event, ends up as a thrill-a-minute thriller where things happen for the sake of another narrative twist however unlikely or out of character it might be. Like so much contemporary commercial fiction, less would have been more. Right from the outset we know that after being witnesses in a rape trial 15 years ago, Kit and Laura are now living in fear of their lives. So alongside the 'then' rape story is a 'now' pot-boiler which is a bit Single White Female with additional twists, ending in a rather silly climax awash with blood, and then a last-page twist that made me giggle.If the book had stuck with the contested rape story I would have enjoyed it better: but it goes off the rails with everyone becoming manic and a bit psychopathic, everyone having lies and secrets, and some wholly ridiculous developments in the last 20% (Kit!!). Alongside that are sub-stories of an alcoholic brother, and the backstory of the accused rapist so that the book gets very cluttered. It's a shame, as when Kelly keeps things focused as at the start of the 'then' narrative, she writes compellingly and uses the atmosphere of eclipses well with its imagery of light and darkness.Readers wanting twist upon twist, however unlikely, will enjoy this - I would have preferred a bit more verisimilitude and a more constant attention to character: 3.5 stars.",4
3878,"When first we practice to deceive! .....and the moral of the story is - little white lies can escalate to life changing issues! The book was very well plotted and certainly keeps you hooked. That said, the characters are irritating. None of them are likeable, but in truth they probably reflect the norm in that all people are flawed and nobody is perfect.  These flawed characteristics are shaped by events in the book that to discuss would spoil the plot. The lies told in the earlier part of the story by the then young protagonists, grow due to the characters not being brave enough to confess or be totally honest. The lies shape their long term relationships, putting lives in jeopardy. However, you cannot condemn them initially for this as you wonder how you would have handled a similar situation.The ending of the book is rather over done, which is a pity as it goes against the credibility of the rest of the tale.  It also stereotypes - particularly the male characters, which I found rather sad. These 2 elements stopped me from rating this a 5star read.The book highlights that the treatment in court of rape victims and witnesses has not changed to any great extent.  It's unlikely to encourage anyone to report the crime.Like others have said, this could make a great TVs series or film",4
3879,"When I first received this Pro 6500 I was so excited!  It was very well packed on external box packaging.  The Pro 6500 box itself was very eye catching and what with all the accessories that came with it.  This is a very good posh ideal gift set to buy for a very special person or occasion.One of the many best accessories are the four different compatible replacement heads and I have previously used all 3 out of 4 on my Oral B 2000 electric toothbrush before I swap to another brand.  And now I am back to Oral B.I like the idea of the sensitive replacement head, as I have not tried before.  The electric toothbrush handle is comfy. The best part of this gadget are the six settings and the pressure sensor.  It has stop me from brushing quite a few time as I was brushing too hard without realising it.I only have it for nearly 3 weeks therefore, I can't genuinely give you my result on the claims it make that I will get teeth whitening whilst I am brushing it, only time will tell.  But I can say that it doesn't vibrate so much like other electric toothbrush that makes your mouth sore or gums bleed.I am still learning / trying to figure out how to use the bluetooth sensor!Please note that this product was given to me free in return for my honest unbiased opinion",4
3880,"When I first started reading He Said She Said by Erin Kelly I was surprised that this book had so many five stars and rave reviews , I found it to be a slow starter and the constant changing between narrator and time lines took a while to get used to, but around the 120 page mark everything clicked into place and this turned from a mediocre read into a book that actually made for an intriguing read.At the centre of the plot are four characters whose live’s become entangled after a chance meeting during an eclipse, the story is told from two perspectives, Kit and Laura’s. After witnessing a brutal attack during an eclipse, the couple do what anyone would do if they found themselves in a similar predicament and call the police, but little do they realise life will never quite be quite the same for them again. As events unfold it soon becomes apparent that nothing is quite as it seems, the characters credibility plays a major factor in this tale, and the reader is led a merry dance to get to the truth.I’m sure at this point I’m going to get some shocked gasps but here we go, although I enjoyed He Said She Said I did have some issues with this book. At times the plot felt drawn out and there were chapters that didn’t necessarily add anything to the read, but actually distracted from the story, if I’m honest I actually found the whole eclipse thing a bit tedious after a while, although in the authors defence I can see why it was included in relation to the plot, it just didn’t work for me.On the positive side come the last half of He Said She Said I was pleasantly surprised at how crafty Erin Kelly had been, I don’t want to give anything away that might spoil the read for others, but suffice to say the conclusion to this book absolutely threw me, as did the surprises along the way. If I were to sum this book up I would say it’s got a great premise, a brilliant second half, but I’m afraid this one struggled to keep my attention. I definitely think I’m in the minority with my thoughts on this book as it’s received so many fabulous reviews and in this case it maybe one you need to read for yourself.",4
3881,"When I put my phone in for the first time before even using it in the car it the plastic casing fell off one side of it..... they then sent another free of charge that works fine, so maybe the first was an anomaly",4
3882,"When I revived my electric toothbrush I was really surprised at how thick the manual was or it.  I had been previously using an electric toothbrush and did like the results I got from that.  I have been using this Oral B toothbrush for just over 2 weeks now.Cons -The actual toothbrush handle is much larger and heavier than my previous toothbrush.  Just something to consider.  I wouldn't think it would be suitable for a young child.I haven't used a round toothbrush head before and that took a bit of getting used to but I did like the cleaning resultsPros -Does a really good cleanLike that you can have a number of different brush heads to clean your teethI like the bluetooth clock but you can also use the toothbrush without this as it changes slightly on its speed when you need to move to cleaning the next area of your mouth.  The bluetooth clock does indicate which part of you mouth you should be cleaning so that is really helpful so you know that you whole mouth is getting a good clean.I like the different settings you have via the bluetooth clock which can be changed to soft clean, much harder clean, cleaning your tongue.  Never seen that before. It also tells you if you are cleaning your teeth too hard.The charge seems to hold well for this toothbrush and I am finding I only need to charge it about once a week when cleaning my teeth twice a day.The toothbrush is quite expensive but having used an other electric toothbrush for a number of years I do think it is a good investment and it is important to give your teeth a good clean .",4
3883,"When I started using my first electric toothbrush I thought I was getting that ""dentist clean feeling"" you hear about, but after upgrading to this, the Oral-B Black Pro 6500 actually makes my teeth feel even cleaner, which I didn't realise was even possibleIt has different modes to choose from, I prefer to alternate between normal and deep clean, fas well as a bit of the tongue cleaning setting. I've been using it along with the bluetooth phone app and its really good. The app will let you connect to the brush to change settings such as light up and vibrate when its time to move quadrants, which I thought was a feature missing out of the box. You can also change the order of the cleaning modes. Now I have changed mine to Deep clean/clean/tongue cleaning first, as these are the modes I use the most.I like the SmartGuide timer it comes with, so you can see what mode the brush is in and the time and quadrants. The app does this, but occasionally you might not have your phone with you in the bathroom - crazy I know!  Another great feature is that the brush handle lights turn red, and the little face on the SmartGuide frowns when you use too much pressure.The handle is a bit heavier than I was expecting and its quite loud but still, I really do like brush",4
3884,"When the box arrived,there was a rattling noise and i suspected something was broken.Upon opening,it was merely the little cleaning brush and small bottle of lubricating oil weren't fixed in a position,just thrown into the box.Trivial,but at this price,i expect better.The razor is supplied with a 2 pin plug and i needed an adaptor.I charged the razor for an hour as the instructions state and used the razor dry.I found i had to continually go over the same skin in order to achieve a clean shave.It was very good but not amazing.The following day,i shaved after applying shaving gel and the results were far better,particularly around the top lip area where i tend to nick my lips with a blade if i'm not concentrating.The razor can be submerged up to a depth of 5m so during the shave,i continually rinsed the razor to remove the gel and the hair.At the end,i removed the shaving foil to rinse thoroughly which is easily done.The razor comes with a protective case but the charging lead won't fit into that as well so i've kept that in the box.The razor has a built in attachment for sideburns but i haven't got any so couldn't test that out.Overall,the razor feels robust,high quality and gives the impression,it will provide many years of good service.It's a good light weight and fits well in the hand.The battery is of the type that doesn't degrade over time.My only reservations are the trivial bits,rattling bits in the box,nowhere to store charging lead.This razor,at this price, is a considered purchase.Overall,an excellent razor using gel,less good shaving dry.",4
3885,"While I was waiting to get hold of a rollout blackout curtain, I used this product for several weeks and it indeed did the job. It's not too pretty, so I was determined to go for a different permanent solution, but for travelling or as a transitory measure to black out a room, this is great. We're actually moving to a new house and I'll be using this while new curtains are being made.",4
3886,Who to believe? That is the question.  Lots of  good twists and turns right to the end.Very enjoyable read.,4
3887,"With Oral-B Pro you can rest assured you are doing the best for your teeth (as long as you floss also) and I think your teeth will thank you in years to come.  After using it, my teeth and gums feel very clean.  However I do think this model is expensive and I think you can get many of the benefits without necessarily spending so much.  It does have very smooth functions but I have not yet set up all the extras and am unsure they are entirely necessary.",4
3888,"With the battery on my previous Oral-B now starting to show its age and having dropped the clock a few too many times which led to the display finally breaking I went and purchased this model.  Does the job quite nicely and continues on from what my old model did, it also comes with a bluetooth connection to use with your smartphone/tablet and an app you can get. Not a function that interested me that much but some people may found it worthwhile.  Comes with a very handy travel case which will be of use to me.",4
3889,"Wondered where the story was going, but it made compulsive reading.  Did not want to put it down. Unexpected twist to the ending.",4
3890,Wonderful value Christmas gift they loved it,4
3891,"Worked pretty well so far, a few of the sticky things did come off occasionally but the blind stayed up so it's ok",4
3892,Works,4
3893,Works a treat. Only 4 stars as you do need to purchase the velcro strips recommended on ordering as the suction pads will not do the job alone!,4
3894,Works but expensive.Do not need the bluetooth,4
3895,Works fine so far. Agree with other comments that it doesnt sync neither with app nor timer from time to time. So if you need smth similarbut cheaper go for Oral b smart series 4000.,4
3896,"Works fine, but putting my phone in and out of it sometimes twists it, as it is essentially ""wedged"" in the air vent.",4
3897,"Works fine, clean's good. No better than my old one and my old one doesn't switch off if I press to hard or try to get in an awkward angle. Probably as good as any cheaper ones out there. Haven't used to app and couldn't work out how the brushes fit into the holder.",4
3898,Works good but like other said sticky things are not very sticky.,4
3899,"Works great but even with all the velcro for adjustments, the light gets in thru the crevices.Still makes miracles for me as a night worker I need to sleep during the day.",4
3900,"Works great to block out the light. Harder then I thought to stick to the window as sometimes the suckers don't stick fully. The Velcro is a bit fiddly at first, but with practice it's easy to put up.",4
3901,"Works great, good price and service",4
3902,"Works great, tho pretty big for my window so has a few gaps, but you can reposition so it shines the light away from the bed, also still able to open the window for cool air at night and helps reduce the bugs that get in too!!",4
3903,Works great!  Perhaps a little over kill for a toothbrush but excellent price!,4
3904,Works like a charm. A bit tricky to get up and running.,4
3905,Works perfectly on the air vents or either my Mercedes C-Class or my wifes Focus. You have to push it in quite hard into the vent to ensure it wont droop (it very occasionally does) but for the most part it works as expected. So happy.,4
3906,"Works quite well.  Suckers are too near edge of material, set just a cm further in would allow for slightly better fit as light beams on round edges, especially if gathered,  but far better than nothing",4
3907,Works quite well. I can sleep very well now during the day. The only think I don't like is sometimes i can fell the plastic smell from it.,4
3908,"Works really well at blocking the light so does exactly as it says it will. Only thing is it's a bit fiddly to put up, especially for short people! Lots of poppers and velcro to battle with so can take a bit of time to get it right. Definitely easier the bigger the window.",4
3909,"Works reasonably well, but took ages to put up as the poppers kept coming off and I had to use a lot of force to get them to stick (even with putting some water on them).  By the next day, some of the poppers popped off again which was frustrating so you have to check them every day.  They are also spaced quite far apart so parts of the blackout curtain do not lie flat against the window and leave gaps for the light to come through.  Still better to use this than not at all.",4
3910,Works very well but sometimes difficult to get suckers to stick,4
3911,"Works very well to keep sun out of room -- good size as it adapts vertically or horizontally to quite a number of windowsBest to buy the velcro (stick on squares) as well to be sure that it stays up without falling everA pity it's not thermal too, as sun heat through glass is accentuated on the black material and makes room too warm",4
3912,Works well and a little smarter than our previous ones.,4
3913,Works well and cleans really well but feels like the manufacturers couldn't come up with a way to improve on previous models so they stuck in the wireless display and Bluetooth mode ( to connect with phone app). For a toothbrush that is pretty pointless.  I used the display a few times but found too much lag between brush and display and between brush and phone. Now using without display or phone app and loving it...,4
3914,"Works well and easy to fit but during the summer months, when you need it the most, the black colour attracts the heat and can make rooms hot",4
3915,Works well and easy to get the phone in and out,4
3916,"Works well as a blackout blind, and convenient to use. Just need to make sure you place the suction cups on a very flat area (we used a plastic window frame to attach) and use a little water to stick!Also it took me a while to put up as I am short so this could be a duty for a daddy!The product came in a pouch so some of the suction cups were bent which made it difficult to put up so the manufacturer may want to reconsider packaging.",4
3917,Works well but for some reason found that the suction pads kept falling off one section of my window. Think it may have been the window though as it didn't happen when we went away.,4
3918,"Works well, bit fiddly getting it to stick sometimes but keeps light out and great for travelling",4
3919,"Works well, but not big enough for our double bedroom. Some light gets in at the bottom as it isn't tall enough. Definitely helps though, we were sick of waking up with the sun at like 5am!! We work nights a lot, get to sleep around 3am, and this made us both less cranky haha",4
3920,"Works well, smells a bit plasticy but soon goes. I had to stick some of the suckers a few times but overall really pleased. about to go on holiday and taking it so ill see if it re-sticks? Definately does the trick for now though",4
3921,"Works well, suction cups need a little water to stick well",4
3922,Works well. Not total black out but really  makes a difference.,4
3923,Works well. Simple to use for a kid. Slightly annoying and fiddly when it comes to adding an app or allocating permission on something that is not in the pre-list. Some contents will not work when travelling abroad due to copy right rules of each regions. Highly annoying when your little one cannot see his cartoons when travelling abroad. Had to download stuff on the USB before hand.,4
3924,"Works, surprisingly  ...",4
3925,"Would get five stars except the suction cups are useless.  I was expecting to have to do the whole thing with velcro anyway, so it's not that bad, but if you're going to put suction cups on, at least make sure they work.",4
3926,"Would have 5 stars except I tried to suggest an improvement and they basically said ""Go away""",4
3927,Would never pay £200+ for this. Got it on offer. Just a normal toothbrush with a lot of gimmics.,4
3928,"Yep, does what it is supposed to do, clean teeth. Apart from that I can`t get excited about it.",4
3929,"You get a lot of 'extra stuff' with this toothbrush that I think 99% of people don't need and won't use.  And as far as I can tell it is just like the 'lower' models (for the most part)... so if you are debating between this one and the one below it, I would go for the one below it!  A great toothbrush though, very happy with it.",4
3930,"You have no doubt heard the familiar idiom to `wax lyrical', to talk about something so enthusiastically?After having watched the promotional video of this electric shaver, the Braun 9095CC I thought this could be the the electric shaver men have been yearning for but never found.Opening the packaging you certainly get quite a bit for your money, the Braun 9095CC, a very decent travel case, a cleaning cartridge and a charging and cleaning base station. Not forgetting the two pin lead and the little brush. Hmmm. Size wise this is no shrinking violet, but it is not heavy.I was a little disappointed that the chromed and silvered shell of the shaver is in fact coated plastic, the only metal being the charging pins and the cutting edges and foil. The rest is all plastic and it's rubberised at the back to enhance grip. On a personal level, for such a high end product Braun should have used metal rather the plastic chrome.Out of the box it had no charge, but as the advertising blurb stated, within the hour it was ready to go. Braun are not pulling your leg on that one. As I hadn't had a shave for a couple of days I thought I'd get straight to it. I don't have baby face stubble, mine has been honed to Desperate Dan strength over the years and the shaver coped really well.My first impression was how it didn't irritate my face and make it itch, which was the norm with a number of Philishave shavers I have had in the past. My second impression was that I noted it struggled with some areas, under the jaw line, a little on the neck and under the nose, where more flat laying hairs are found. After a thorough 8 minute shave I was fairly and reasonably clean shaven. However when I ran my hand over my face to check how it had performed it was not completely smooth, there was still a fine `sandpaper' rasp.Let's be clear, while this electric shaver is an extremely good `electric shaver' it is in no way as close as a blade. To illustrate the fact I dry shaved with the Braun first and then shaved with my trusty, and old, Mach 3 and the evidence was there in the bottom of the basin.This morning I tried a wet electric shave with gel, afterwards I used my trusty Mach 3 and again there was evidence in the bottom of the basin. There was a fine dusting of bristles.This does not provide a true British Army closely shaven chin, it's close, but no cigar, though it is a highly competent electric shaver it is not as close as a blade.The other point to mention is that it has running costs, the cleaning cartridges cost extra and the cutting head should be replaced every year. Still, razor blades are also expensive so once the initial outlay has been made the running costs for the year are not much different to wet shaving.In conclusion I think this is a very good premium electric shaver but it not as good as the promotional video suggests, it's a close shave but the wet razor wins. As to the price of the product, it is a premium product and it is expensive. You will have to decide whether it is value for money though I think the chrome coated plastic cheapens it a little. 4 Stars because it is a decent electric shave, but only just.",4
3931,"----------UPDATE----------26/06/2015After about 3 months of not being able to use much of the bluetooth functionality, Oral B finally released an Android app update!The app reliability has vastly improved and so too has my user experience. To reflect these changes I have upped my star rating from 1 to 3.Overall a good quality product form Braun, hampered only by it's painfully slow charge time. I would still like to see the return of an 'on handle' integrated timer, as was previously seen on my old Braun toothbrush. Not everyone wants the hassle of connecting to a smartphone, or carrying around an extra display. I really used to like seeing how long I have brushed, by simply looking at the handle. I don't understand why it had to be taken away and replaced with a gimmicky external display (that I never use!).--------------------------------Bluetooth support seems to be VERY temperamental on Android. In fact I am so disappointed with the lack of support on this issue, I've decided to copy and paste my months ignored feedback from the Google play app store. Take a look for yourself before you buy, I am not alone on this matter. I just want to warn others before making such an expensive toothbrush investment, based on what I feel are unreliable product claims. Hopefully a fall in sales will make Oral B notice!!!My feedback from the play store:Synchronisation on kitkat was patchy, sometimes requiring multiple attempts for the app to initiate session synchronisation with the handle. Since my lollipop update, the app now fails to retrieve stored data from the handle. There is also no user profile functionality for multiple users. Very disappointed with this Oral B; this brush was a lot of money for what seems to be nothing more than gimmick. This app really degrades Braun's superb engineering. *GET_YOUR_ACT_TOGETHER!*",3
3932,...just fine,3
3933,"""Pure"" but doesnt clean very well",3
3934,"*Warning: contains spoilers*I couldn’t wait to read this, as Erin Kelly is one of my favourite authors and I’ve loved all of her other novels, and also because the subject matter is something that interests me. However, my initial feeling was disappointment – I’d got into all her other books straight away, whereas this one felt very slow, with too much scientific detail about eclipses. Kit’s present day chapters were particular slow and very little of interest happens.Her writing style also didn’t seem as distinctive as usual (though I’m not sure if that was just the effect of reading this one on the kindle, instead of in paperback like the others.) If I hadn’t known this was by the same author, I don’t think I would have guessed. For example, the sex scenes in her other novels have been really well written, emotive and not crude at all, whereas between Laura and Kit they just focused on the mechanics and didn’t seem romantic at all. I can’t put my finger on it exactly, but the ‘first contact’ section (almost 40% of the book) didn’t grab me at all. The rape and aftermath should have felt tense, but they felt very flat and formulaic. The hints about Beth were more confusing than tantalising. I kept hoping something unexpected and shocking would happen, but it never did.But, from 40% onwards I did become more intrigued. What grudge could Beth possibly have against Laura and Kit, given that Jamie was convicted? When and how does her behaviour change? The pace definitely does pick up here and becomes a lot tenser once Laura and Beth become ‘friends’. However, the incident in Zambia, and the moment when Beth finally comes back into their lives feel anticlimactic. Like Laura’s anxiety, a lot of build up and no action. But I do like that at this point you’re still not sure who the villain is; or are Beth and Jamie both the villains?The big twist comes three quarters of the way through. And it was a good twist, I hadn’t seen it coming; although, once you know the first bit, the rest falls into place.I liked the feminist theme of the novel: whereas the traditional ‘happy ending’ is romantic love and marriage, this one ends with friendship and bonds between women. I also liked that Beth was shown to be the most honest, genuine person with the most integrity, moving away from the harmful stereotype of a rape survivor as a liar or mentally unhinged. It shows the thought patterns of controlling men, even those who don’t actually commit crimes against women; in many ways, Kit had the same selfishness and sense of entitlement as Jamie, he’s just more cowardly. In this, Kelly did well.In terms of the actual plot and style though, this isn’t a favourite of mine. I wasn’t nearly as engrossed as I was with her first three novels (The Poison Tree, The Sick Rose, The Burning Air). I didn’t want those to end, whereas with this one I was happy enough to finish and move on to something else. It seems like maybe the author is trying too hard to please, now that she's more popular, but it felt strained and melodramatic. I hope she goes back to the style of her excellent early novels.",3

The phone mount holder is by nature of its size, shape and fixing method going to limit what can be mounted to small lightweight  variety.4 /.  The design requires it to be attached to your vehicle fan vents. The Phone holder separates into two separate pieces by pressing  a small button on the rear of the unit.5 /.  The only practicable way to locate the mount is to place the rear piece on the vent than add the front piece which gives a loud click  when locked into place.6 /  The frontal piece turns through a full 360 degrees but I found my mount to be very stiff, so much so that I would not be surprised to  find damage caused whilst trying to turn it.7 /  The area that grips the phone has two small rubberised grab areas approximately 3/4 inch deep. The grabs open to a maximum of  3 and 3/4 inches wide.8 /  I can see the possibility of a phone separating from this kind of mount whilst in use. Bumps, in the road, sudden braking and similar.9 /  Overall this mobile holder is my my opinion only of use for small and very lightweight mobiles. The probability of separation gives me  concern about safety. The last thing needed whilst driving is such a thing happening whilst driving. The item relies on the strength of  the pressure of the spring holding the grips closed to in turn ensure the mobile stays in place. I believe it likely that the spring will  become less efficient with use.10 /  I hope that this review has provided you with some helpful information.

The novel has an interesting premise: after a young couple witness what they believe to be rape their own world starts to fall apart through the strain of the secrets they keep from each other.  As the alleged victim forces herself into their lives they start to doubt what they thought occurred.  The story develops the themes of guilt, betrayal and trust.  Many of the reviews for the novel describe the tension and suspense but I struggled to engage with the characters.  The plot was interesting and the story unravelled with adequate twists and turns.  I never felt the background of solar eclipses added significant value other than enabling the characters to predict the movements of each other, and expected a little more.  But fans of the genre should enjoy.Overall 3/5. (Plot 3/5, Characterisation 3/5, Literary Merit 3/5, Readability 3/5.)",3

3959,"A mid-priced, Wet/Dry shaver and trimmer from the German brand of Braun.The box uses a tricky closure method but is not too difficult to open. It comes with a Euro-type plug and thus is suited for use with most bathroom and hotel shaver sockets but not those that use US-style flat-pin sockets. The charger plug/adapter unit is quite slim and will easily fit into a typical wash bag. I often charge my shavers (I am about to retire one) using either a two-pin shaver adapter in a convenient 13A socket or use the specially-shaped adapters when they fit - Braun's plugs never seem to do so.Packed with the adapter lead in a separate box is the cleaning brush and the head cover. However, when fitted, it is quite easy to remove the cover and head as one and this is typical of other Braun shavers (I had recently tried a series 7 model) unless you gently push off one side at a time. Usable with or without a balm or similar shaving lotion, gel or foam and also washable after use if needed.It requires an initial charge of around 4 hours, by which time its LED should have ceased to flash, although an hour is normal thereafter. This will provide about 45 minutes' of use, enough for a couple of weeks' shaving. It also has a moustache or sideburn trimmer, as is now common, which slides up for use.With two types of cutter, foil and blade with a slim blade between the foils, it should be capable of handling most men's whiskers for up to 2-3 days' growth. However, for those with very heavy growth, 1-2 days will be more realistic.As a user in recent years of mostly rotary shavers although I do have a foil shaver that I use when travelling, this seems less than fully effective on my moderately light two-day growth; it had left several areas completely untouched and a distinct ghost shadow where it had performed to its probable best. A touch-up with my rather worn rotary shaver cleaned up where the Braun did not.",3

However, having read all of her books so far and enjoyed them, I wasn’t blown away by this one.  There was a slow start, way too much information about eclipses and I just didn't engage with any of the characters.

3967,"A very good quality shaver, let down by a weak trimmer, no dock and the hefty price tag.The 9 series 9040s both looks and feels like a premium quality shaver. It comes in a sleek, black finish and feels reassuringly heavy. When you switch it on, also (following the initial 1-hour charge) you are met with a unusually loud and fast motor, which sounds like a swarm of angry mosquitoes! It both handles and sounds expensive and powerful.The claims of ""proven of 3 day beards"" are totally true. It makes short work of medium growth and is so powerful, you won't feel worried about tackling anything longer (though to protect the blades, it may be better to shorten them down with a trimmer first).It also tackles neck hairs very well (as well as I've found, though still struggles on some!). Overall, it gives a lovely shave and you feel yourself unavoidably stroking your neatly shaved cheeks after. I've found very  little difference in pressing the ""wet"" button, it seems to give a great wet shave on either wet or dry setting--though, for reasons not really explained, it does have a dedicated wet mode, so you're probably better off using it. It's also fully waterproof (to 5m), so you can use it in the shower or bath without worrying.It's not all good, though. Despite the power and ease at shaving down growth it's not very good at tackling detail areas around facial hair you want to keep. The best cutting seems to come from the central two cutters and the outer foil shavers aren't very good at dealing with longer hair on their own. This means you can get close to (say) a goatee, but not enough to leave a razor edge.The flip up trimmer on the back is (as another reviewer has noted) very poor quality. It's no better than the cheapo £20 trimmer on a shaver I bought in the 80s! And if you're hoping to actually use it for anything other than the odd awkward neck hair (such as tidying the edges of a goatee or mustache) you're going to need to get a secondary trimmer. (note: that the premium Philips Series 7000 comes with a professional quality beard trimmer).Another detractor is the lack of a dock. This may seem like nitpicking, but as the shaver is already built with charging nodes on the back (presumably for the more expensive charging station), I see no reason why they couldn't have added a cheap docking stand given the price (many cheaper shavers manage this).A good point is that it comes with a very good quality travel case (which, to be fair, is probably as desirable as a dock, especially if you travel a lot).Overall, I can only recommend this if you can afford to splash out this much on a shaver and don't have any facial hair. For a clean shave, it's pretty exceptional and as good as I've ever tried for face and neck. Though, if you can afford this, you're probably better off splashing out on the full clean and charge version (series 9 9095).If, on the other hand, you do have facial hair, then I'd recommend the Philips Series 7000 over this. It's not quite as good at giving a clean shave, but it's not far behind and far better for shaping facial hair (in Top Trumps terms, this is 98 Clean Shave, 05 Facial Hair; The Philips is 90 Clean Shave, 90 Facial Hair).",3

3972,"After about three weeks, I now feel that I can make proper review on the device. For clarity, the review was written in bullet points.  In short, I am unfortunately a bit disappointed.First impression:- The razor makes a moderate impression and does not seem so high quality. The workmanship is impeccable and it is not too light, but it looks hollow and plastic. You can't expect much more from a razor at this price however.The shave (dry):- The razor slides well over the skin and adapts well to the skin.- The shaving result is not that impressive compared to other shavers (Carrera for example). The neck is hard to shave with me.-It is a very gentle shave, but unfortunately the shaver does not catch all whiskers well, so I have to go over a few places 5 to 6 times or even remove it with my traditional razor.- Overall, unfortunately only ""okay"".The shave (wet):- The razor glides pleasantly over the skin.- I had the great hope of wet shaving, but it quickly left me when many hairs just were impossible to get. Both the neck and the face, the result was very dirty and bad, although the shaving with shaving foam was very pleasant. Even shaving once with and once against has not led to a satisfactory result.Functionality:- The razor has a power button with good feel and good pressure point.- Integrated LED bars indicate the battery level well.- The loading and shaving time is very good (load 5 minutes = one shave, load 1 hour = shave 45 minutes).- The razor and the shaving system can be easily, quickly and easily rinse under running water. The brush is somewhat redundant, but can be used to perfectly clean the razor when it is dry.- The device has an acceptable operating volume.- The device is quite light, fits well in the hand and is very grippy with a blue rubber coating.Conclusion: Overall, I can not recommend the Braun 3010s wet & dry, mainly because of the shaving result (wet not good, dry acceptable). All in all, ok for the price, but would not buy it again.",3
3973,"After just over 6 months of usage I feel that:1 - This is a good toothbrush to use, I really like the 2 minute countdown and the different modes2 - The bluetooth/app combination is a pointless gimic I've only ever used for the first few days3 - I have been having problems with batterylife, so likely to need to return it under warranty soon. However the returns process would appear to be excellent (free postage and clear/easy to use website), so that is a positive.In future I'd go for the slightly cheaper version without the application/bluetooth combo that is unnecessary.",3

3975,"After watching an eclipse, Laura and boyfriend Kit witness an attack that changes their lives forever. Flipping back and forth over 15 years and from the point of view of different characters this is a unique, thought provoking thriller about rape, revenge, relationships and solar eclipses where you're made to question who to believe. The first third of the story covering the court case and introducing us to Laura and Kit's relationship are tense and interesting but the book loses its way as the couple chase eclipses while essentially in hiding and living in fear and we're left waiting for something significant to happen. The book is salvaged by a final third full of twists, turns and revelations but I struggled to like the characters and found the ending just the wrong side of believable. Not bad but not blinding.",3
3976,All about the court room outcome of a rape case - interesting but not inspiring,3
3977,all good thank you,5
3978,"All I can say is I had to work at reading this book, slow going and at times dull. Made it to the end and glad I did.",3
3979,"Although the final third of book has good pace and is full of suspense, I found the rest of the book without suspense or pace . The plodding detail of the first two thirds of the hook killed the suspense for me and I had to force myself to continue. Whether the  eclipse chasing was symbolic/allegorical or not, I found this unnecessary to the story and it felt to me like an add on.",3
3980,"Although these contain no chemicals and are good for your baby, the design needs to be improved. Once you're about two-thirds of the way down the packet they are significantly wetter. I often have to give them a squeeze before use, or use some dry wipes (so yet another thing to buy and remember to take with you and replenish). I also think the combination of the dispenser hole and the way they've been folded is useless. If you have only one hand free (as you would most of time you use one of these) trying to pick out just one wipe is tricky. Often I've tried to get one wipe and ended up with three or four, which can be really wasteful. I get that these are an ethical choice, but they could be much better.",3
3981,"Although these do as they say: the protect the screen, they tend to chip easy and crack easier than others I have triedOk for the price but if your looking for something robust I would spend a little more",3
3982,Although this is a great accessory and really does block the light out I don't feel it is usefull for everyday use as it is a pain getting it to stick up every night then take down. I think its great for holidays or short periods of time but with the cost I wisjh now I would have paid a little more and had more of a fixed blind that I could roll up.,3
3983,"Although this product is top of the range and it feels and looks professional, it really did surprise me with the power and ""hardness"" of the action. It felt like I had an electronic brick in my mouth!!! Takes some getting used to and although it does do a good job, I feel like my teeth have been battered by this tool. The included battery operated monitor is a bit of a gimmick and as the brush itself vibrates every 30 seconds you don't need a separate monitor with a smiley face to tell you how long you have been brushing - some may like it but it doesn't add to the experience for me.I have had to revert back to my bog standard electric brush for a few days to give my teeth a rest from the bombardment they received from this brush!! I don't have particularly sensitive teeth and I have had some  work done at the famous place in Budapest last year so they are in very good shape. Glad I got it at a knock down price.",3
3984,Although water wipes are fantastic to use and have I really don't understand why they are so expensive...its such a good product and I've recommend to lots of my friends and family but some can't afford them.,3

3993,Arrived promptly and well packaged.. But does not cover the entire screen on the iPhone 6s.! It's approx 3mm shy of the edge of the phone all round? It doesn't effect the use of the phone and was easy to apply. Looks ok but just odd that it doesn't cover completely.,3

3995,"Arrived very promptly and packaging of the product was good.  Instructions on how to apply were clear and concise and once on the touch and feel are good.  However, the biggest disappointment is the fact that it does not cover the whole screen.  There is a gap all around the edge and, when paired with a case that forms a lip, dust builds up in the gap. Surely a screen protector should protect the whole screen.",3

So it takes a while to get going, but once it does it has enough intrigue and twists to propel you rapidly to the end. Its a bit like a rollercoaster that takes as long getting you to the highest point as it does releasing you through the ensuing fast drop and loop the loops.",3
4004,"As I was sick of buying razor blades I thought I would give an electric shaver a go. My criteria were decent battery, wet & dry, and that's about it.It's OK, charge lasts for ages, but I shave three times a week. Works perfectly in the shower. Compared to a wet shave, yeah - it is not as good, and to be honest it takers longer to get a less good job.But I must have saved at least six billion quid on razor blades ijn just one year, given what they cost. What do they make them out of, eh?",3
4005,"As other people have posted, this screen protector does not cover the whole phone. Simple and easy to apply.

For this reason I give it 3 stars.",3
4006,"As others have said, there were small errors regarding Cornwall (I'm not from there, but know it well) and dates, and it did irritate me. And who were ""the girls"" mentioned in (I think) Chapter 45?The two main characters were one dimensional and I disliked them both, particularly Laura who came across as a smug social justice warrior, accentuated by the reference to ""women's studies"". Kit's obsession with the eclipse was boring, and too much was made of his twin brother and drunken father without them having any real purpose in the story.The first half of this book was tedious and I nearly put it away, but I did enjoy the second half. Perhaps I don't read as carefully as others or was too distracted to notice them, but I was surprised by the twists. I'm glad I stuck with it.I've never read anything by this author but I will have a look at her other novels because apparently they are better than this one.",3
4007,As per other reviews it is a little small but so far it has done the job,3

4011,"August 1999.  Laura Langrishe and her boyfriend Kit McCall are in Cornwall for a music festival timed to coincide with a solar eclipse when Laura stumbles on what she believes to be the rape of Beth Taylor by Jamie Balcombe, although Jamie claims that the sex was consensual.  Called as a witness at Balcombe’s trial, Laura is indignant that his defence rests on attacking Beth’s character and behaviour and tells a small lie to help secure a conviction.  After the trial, she and Beth form a friendship but it’s not long before both she and Kit become concerned by Beth’s behaviour, which quickly develops into a dangerous obsession.March 2015.  Now married, Laura and Kit live under assumed names in Harringay and, haunted by that 1999 event and what happened afterwards, have done everything they can to make themselves invisible on-line.  But Kit is a dedicated eclipse chaser who’s arranged to see the next one in the Faroe Islands, leaving Laura (now pregnant with twins) at home alone.  Laura never told him about her lie, terrified that it will destroy their relationship, but no secret can remain hidden forever and the consequences of discovery could very well be fatal …Erin Kelly wrote this psychological thriller to show how the criminal justice system fails sex crime victims but while there are some clever ideas and an interesting twist, the story is skewed in one direction and the 2015 sections (particularly the Faroe Islands trip) drag while the ending is so ridiculous and overblown that for me it undermined the author’s aim.  My two big issues with the plot were Laura’s lie (which any defence barrister should have undermined with cross-examination and questioning of the victim and which carry no real consequence) and Kit’s 2015 sections, which seem intended to build tension but ultimately only serve as filler.  This is a shame because Laura’s sections were well crafted and I enjoyed the slow build up of her anxiety and fears and how she got to the point she’s at and Kelly’s depictions of eclipses and Kit’s interest in them are well written and evocative.  Beth is also an interesting character with Kelly giving her an intensity that justifies Laura’s doubts but it’s a shame that Balcome is not given the same nuance and depth.  Ultimately although this book didn’t quite work for me I would definitely check out Kelly’s other work.",3

4023,Be great if they stayed up,3
4024,Before buying this I used Phillips Sonicare and I must confess I like that one better.This Oral-B feels rough and makes a noise like a road workers drill. Plus it doesn't make your teeth any cleaner than the Phillips and the battery charge doesn't last as long. It's okay but I would no buy it again,3
4025,big problems to attach it properly on glass... it fall down easely and I hate that.,3
4026,"Bit confused by the claim that they contain no chemicals when the main ingredient is water. I think someone may have failed basic chemistry there. But still, cute marketing gimmick I guess. Anyhoo, baby's butt is clean so I'm happy.",3
4027,Bit disappointed with this toothbrush. If used on the highest setting it really does drain the battery so it doesn’t last very long before it’s needed a charge again. My teeth are a lot cleaner though so top marks for that! Just not as “high tech” as I thought it was. I think I would recommend it though.,3

Having added movies from our home PC to watch offline I was very disappointed to discover you cannot make them available in the 'kids' user account - you can only make available films bought from Amazon in the kids account. So, if you do not have Wifi, the only way to watch your own films is to log your child in with the adult profile which defeats the point of having a kids account so you may as well have any tablet. How difficult would it be for them to let you select which films to make available? Once our 'free' year runs out the kids mode will be useless unless we renew subscription (at cost) or buy a load of content - I have no issue having to pay for unlimited access/ films we do not already own but it is ridiculous you cannot make your own - already owned - content available. Would be interesting to know why this is as apart from making even more money out of the product there doesn't appear a logical explanation.Other than the above the device seems ok for children and well built.",3

4047,Bought on an impulse because of the offer and quite good reviews but after several weeks of use I have come to the conclusion that it's only as good as my phillips aquashave which was around £150 cheaper.I guess you're paying for the clever??? cleaning device and the ungenerous (only one supplied) solution.Coincidently I recently bought a Steba mini oven also from Amazon which is also a German made product and was over £100 so again you think you're paying for a quality product so of course it's got to be good! - Nope!That's my twopennyworth comment on German engineering,3
4048,"Bought the shaver on Mar 2015. It's been working fine since I had it. The quality of the shave is good. I'll give it a 3.5 out of 5 for quality and the battery life is pretty strong so you don't have to recharge too frequently.The main is the trimmer which was damaged today 21st Sept 2015.

Going to leave it on as either one it's doing a good job and prevented me scratching the screen or two there was a fault.  Either way a little disappointed as I can't think what in my bag could have caused it.  Anyway I've posted a picture too, it is just above the home button.Any ideas welcome,",3
4051,Bought this a couple of times because it arrives super quick and it's super cheap. However they seem to crack very easily which is very frustrating. They are quite fragile but they do protect the phone really well.,3
4052,Bought this as a spare in the fire sale. I already have a 9 series and the charge and clean module. This does not work with the charging cleaning cradle - it has all the connectors but is not compatible! Lesson learnt.,3
4053,Bought this at a good price on Black Friday. Like all Oral B electric toothbrushes (and I have had several over the years) it works very well. The different brushing modes are useful but the bluetooth connected display and the smartphone facility are a useless gimmick and I would definitely not pay for these at full price.,3

4055,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. It is a great little tablet however after 2 days of use it decided to pack up and there was no life even though it had been fully charged. After speaking to amazon they replaced it very quickly as it has a 2 year worry free guarantee which I was impressed with, however I didn't expect it to die so soon which is why the low stars. I'm just hoping the replacement doesn't do the same.",3
4056,Bought this many many months ago and I am highly embarrassed that I paid this stupid money for something that has so many useless 'qualities' ... I mean Bluetooth on a toothbrush???!!! What was I thinking this ain't much different from my £30 one I had a few years ago only this one just has the added lame gimmicks. Only buy if you've got more money than sense. I now have neither after buying this toothbrush. Oral b laughing all way to the bank!,3
4057,Bought this product for tenants in a property.  Have not had no complaints can only assume all is well.,3
4058,"Bought this product on a Prime deal from AmazonThe pros - cleans teeth really well, though, having previously used a Colgate omron for a couple of years I've found it a big clunky in comparison.I've not used the Bluetooth, but the led timer and clock is helpful (5* and a smiley for 2.5 min clean, only 4* smiley  for 2 mins, and no smiley if you don't  last 2 mins - would be great for kids!)The cons  - the time it takes to charge - closer to 18 hours, and you lose a bar within a day of using, and a 'full charge' doesn't last more than 5 days of 2x 2 min sessions. Compared to other models on the market this really isn't good enough - it's just too high maintenance and the Philips  Sonicare with its 3 week charge is on my Christmas list this year",3
4059,Bought this so that I could keep a track of my childrens teeth brushing (make sure they're brushing their teeth often/well enough). Impossible though - the phone app you're supposed to use with this doesn't distinguish between toothbrush heads. So what's the point!,3
4060,"Bought this to replace my old OralB toothbrush which lasted me for years. I did my research and felt that this model probably met all my requirements, particularly the choice of settings for different types of brushing. I was not really interested in the more technical wizardry, syncing with applications etc does not do it for me. What finally made up my mind was that it was reduced in price from some £80 to £62, which I still thought was pricey, but with a £20 amazon voucher, I thought at £42 that was about as much as it should cost. And my advice is you should not need to pay more than that for what is otherwise just an electric toothbrush, the rest is wizardry that does nothing for your teeth.As a tooth brush it is ok, Yes it does clean my teeth well, but then again so did my old one that cost around £25. So I get a smiley face that tells me which ""quadrant"" of my teeth I should be brushing and a red light if I press too hard, And it awards you stars for length of time spent brushing, 4 stars being the max. This morning I only got 3 stars so slapped wrists for me. The rebellious  part in me felt good, hate being told what to do. It also tells you the time.Wow! So underwhelming, so unnecessary.  It has one other benefit in that when you are an early bird like me, brushing your teeth at 5.30 am, it makes a loud enough noise so that if you were only half awake it will make sure you are fully awake. And lets not forget you can do weight training at the same time - this is no lightweight model,To summarize, its a tooth brush, it will clean your teeth well, it will tell you the time,  And if you register online, you get an extra year's warranty making it 3 in total instead of 2.  Not bad but not great",3

4063,"Braun Series 3 3040 Men's Electric Foil Shaver...Xmas gift. as a starter shaver, its used, must say its not brilliant but works.Very fair for price",3
4064,"Braun Series 9 9095CC Wet/Dry Electric Shaver.Braun have launched their long awaited new flagship foil shaver - the 9 series. The previous top of Braun's shaver range was the 7 series of which I had two and for many years I thought they were the best shavers on the market. Given the opportunity to test this new top of the range shaver I must admit I really looked forward to using it. Was this the ultimate foil shave ???.From the box it looked very promising - a smart stylish substantial handset, a new shape charging / cleaning station with one (Normal) cleaning cartridge, probably the best ever hard shell leather travel case, a charging lead, a small brush and the multi-lingual instruction book.The box is most impressive with 5 out of the 6 surfaces extolling the new features along with lots of new buzz words essential in selling a new model (of anything) and telling you it is better than the last one. It says that this is Braun's No. 1 shaver with intelligent ""Syncro Sonic"" technology. It is their best ever for efficiency and comfort, has a newly designed and advanced cleaning / charging station and a new type of shaver head for an outstandingly through and comfortable shave.Big claims indeed. Now did the new flagship shaver live up to them ???  Well no I am afraid to say.After charging in what appears to be the same type of station that came with the 7 series (albeit a different shape) I tried the shaver on a day-old growth. The first thing I noticed was the vibration in hand which after a short time became uncomfortable to hold. This alone would be nothing if Braun had achieved a really good shave but they have not, certainly no better than the 7 series and no where near as good as another I have found. There is more vibration than my old 7 series and even more than a 3 series I tested a year back and the shave just does not live up to the claims nor to the performance expected from a new top end model.The handset is designed to be used wet or dry and as a result it cannot be used ""corded"" for safety reasons. It can however be used in a shower or bath but here's a strange thing - the instruction book says it is NOT to be used with gel or foam. Now I cannot claim to have used such a shaver ""wet"" but what else would you use it with  ??? For dry shaving they stress not to wash first and this is normal. If it works best on a dry face you would need something to use it wet. Braun do not say what that might be...just no gel or foam.The handset is made of shiny chromed plastic and a black rubberised back and only time will tell if the shiny finish will last when it gets wet.. The shaving head is deeper than the 7 series indicating that it might do more with each pass but this is not so. Braun's claim of skin comfort from this head is true for me as I have not had any problems in that area.A useful feature is that the floating head can be locked into any one of five positions for shaving awkward places. The total shave time of 50 mins is about right although the number of individual shaves will vary according to performance and the trimmer at the back works well.One item I thought was missing was the plastic clip-on head protector that is usually added but reading the instruction book I found that Braun expect you to keep your shaver in the cleaning station when not in use. and even go so far as to say use the cleaning operation after every shave. This practice is not only inconvenient but expensive. There is no point in have a shaver with a 50 min capacity and then top up the charge every day plus your rather expensive cleaning cartridge will not last long HOWEVER it will substantiate Braun's claim to give you a clean fresh shaver every time you use it but just remember you are paying not Braun.For travelling the on/off switch can be locked which is also a useful feature and as I said earlier the hard shell, leather travel case is a joy to behold and will protect your investment against any eventuality.If we were to consider the ultimate shave as 10/10, I would score the 9095cc at 7/10 and whilst that is perhaps not a bad score, I do not consider it is high enough for a new flagship model with so many claims and such a high price point.  That price point is another story, listed at £330 it has been discounted by 1/3 BEFORE the official launch date ! Is this a marketing ploy to create a false impression of price ? You have all seen Braun products at 50% of list price in a major High Street Chemist. No one makes money at these discounts and certainly not the retailer so just exactly what should the price be ??? At the end of the day you really need to try it to see how it performs for you however by the time you have done so it is too late so think before you jump in especially at over £200.Perhaps I have been spoilt as I recently purchased a new shaver (also with a cleaning and charging station) that performs so well I thought I had found the ultimate - no vibration and almost single pass shaving that leaves the Braun 9095cc far behind. I expected the new Braun to be as good but I regret to say I found it disappointing. There is a lot to like about the 9095cc but it's purpose is as shaver and that's where it is lacking. All the buzz words mean nothing if the new technology does not deliver. There is at least one manufacturer out there whose technology does work.",3

May have to do more leg work to see if this is what I'm to expect or whether I can get a replacement.I would have given this product less star rating from the bad battery life, but as it does a great job cleaning I'm sticking with ""it's ok"" 3/5.",3

4071,Came in a pack of two unfortunately the screen is not fully covered the first one did not reach the sides not the sellers fault manufacturer if you want full cover this is not the screen protector for you,3
4072,Came quickly and the screen protector is good - not as great as ones I've had previously however.,3
4073,Came with two that was a bonus. But it doesn't fit the entire front. Haven't been able to find one that does so this is a good purchase if you can't either. Came early,3
4074,Can be prone to falling down easily depending on how many of the suction pads are attached to your surface where it is hanging. The suction pads often don't stick well. Once we managed after several attempts to get the thing up it did stay up then for 5 nights but this was as I say after several attempts at getting the suction pads to stick.,3
4075,"Can shave myself quicker with a wet razor, it doesn't get your neck clean shaven without spending long time on it, product overrated.",3
4076,Can't see the point in the Bluetooth connectivity. Would have preferred it if they'd invested more in the speed of re-charging and battery life (which is only just ok).,3
4077,"Can't seem to get the sucker pads to stick to the window. Fiddly, but blocks out the light if done right.",3
4078,"Carefully plotted, but characters often irritating. Not a fluent read.",3
4079,"Characters too stereotypical at times.....the posh boy, the barrister, and some that really didn't matter such  as the brother and his partner.  The plot rather plodded along but the plot twists were decent enough",3
4080,Charger with EU plug is not good idea for uk :-),3
4081,cheap and nasty plastic thing it says A4 but only if you fold it in half or just want to trim the narrow side the quality of it i would expect to pay about £2for it not £6.99 and deffo not £12.00+,3
4082,cheap and nasty quailty,2
4083,chipped quite quickly,2
4084,Chips and cracks really easily and I look after my phone! I've never cracked my screen or damaged it. This makes it look like it's saving your screen. A clear screen protector and a good case will do a better job.,3
4085,"Chose this to replace my Phillips electric toothbrush, I could not believe how noisy it was after the Phillips.",3
4086,"Chunkier than I expected. But it works, which is always good",3
4087,clearer instructions on all the heads you get would have been helpfull,3
4088,"Compact holder that on close inspection appears to be well made, the strong metal runners of the phone holding jaws are a notch above others I've come across. The downside is that the air vent prongs do not clamp that tightly to every type of air vent of every car, with no means to tighten up if required. This for me was a let down. I'll stick with it for now a quite a few others have the same set up. Also there is no ability to set it out from your dashboard if the vents are at a slant to it.Wouldn't recommend to others for these points but that could be car specific issues rather than a product fault. Ps instructions a bit vague.",3
4089,could be a closer shave but ok for electric shaver,3
4090,Could be larger. Doesn't cover as much of the screen as it could.,3
4091,Could not feel empathy with any characters in this story. Maybe that was the writers intention but every thriller needs a hero/ine. One for the brown rice eating 80’s yummy mummies!,3
4092,Cracked after a couple of weeks.,3
4093,"Cracked in less than 12 hours. Simply sliding off my wallet onto the desk (less than 0.5 inch). Cheap, but you get what you pay for.",3
4094,Cumbersome but works,3
4095,"Cuts really well and is a nice little size, but my blade went blunt after a couple of uses (of cutting only paper, 2-3 sheets at a time). An okay product but I don't expect it to last very long before I will have to get the blade replaced",3
4096,Cuts well although the head is to large to get to certain places and the trimmer is somewhat flimsy/small,3
4097,Decent little piece of kit but rather annoyed that I have to register a user name that starts charging me a subscription after 12 months.,3
4098,"Decent screen protection, however screen would retain oil and fingerprints very easily and was very hard to clean this off. Also when removing the screen protector the adhesive was so sticky and with the glass shattering it was fairly dangerous. I ended up using a pair of tweezers over the bin just to try to prevent embedding tiny slivers in my hands",3
4099,Decent toothbrush but Argos sell the 9000 for 5 pounds more.,3
4100,Delivered quickly. Poor shaving experience.,3

4102,"Despite carefully following the instructions I was still left with some bubbles between the cove and the phone (on 2 different phones using the 2 covers in the pack). Because the front screen is not covered fully, damages to the edges can easily spread under the cover which is what happened with one of the Phones. I am surprised because I also bought the same brand for the smaller SE phone I have and it fit and worked perfectly!Update. I was contacted by customer service and offered a full refund. I think this gives the customer service a score of 5 while the product itself won't exceed 2 in my opinion. Hence I revised the total score to 3.",3
4103,Despite repeated passes the hair was never clean cut as I expected,3
4104,Despite the amazing reviews I found this book lacking almost to the point of annoying.Didnt capture me at all.I finished it grudgingly over a 2 week period.,3
4105,did not get into this,1
4106,Did not rate it as high as most critic but worth a read for a couple of pounds,3
4107,Did not really enjoy it,1
4108,Did the job once I managed to finally stick the sucker pads to the window,3
4109,Didn't know you had to pay monthly after 12 months for what's on it,3
4110,Didn't meet my expectations given all the 5 star reviews. It is an easy read and mildly entertaining but really nothing special. I only persevered to see what the twist would be. I found the ending pretty silly to be honest.,3
4111,Didn't realise it would be so small but it did the purpose I needed it for. Would recommend anyone buy a bigger one,3
4112,Didn't really stick properly at the edges.,3
4113,Disappointed i cant track or see what my 6 year daughter is doing on her tablet and how long for.,3
4114,Disappointed that it's almost as cheap to buy new razor rather than buy new head/foil.,3
4115,"Disappointed with battery life, Need an option to allow your children to download their programmes, It is annoying to have to log in to the parents profile and to do it for them. All round fair tablet",3
4116,Disappointed. Second Braun 3 I have purchased. Had the older version and returned it and now bought the 3040.The side burn trimmer is great though the foil razor doesn't give a great shave (well in my opinion).I don't know whether this is the product or that I've always used Philips rotary heads.,3
4117,disappointing and slow story with expected ending,3
4118,"Disappointing. A good quality item, but it's hard to make the suckers stick to the window, so very frustrating to use.",3
4119,"Discovered after setting this up that there is no Bluetooth connection. One of the main reasons for purchasing was so Daughter could connect to Bluetooth toys, speakers etc.. so sending it back. Seems a fairly basic requirement so surprised to find it's not there.",3
4120,Does block the light but the suckers can be awkward and takes some time to get right. Not quite as convenient as you might expect.,3
4121,"Does its job well, but does need a fair bit of adjustment to put up and we needed to repeat that every day for a week. However with a baby, it's well worth the hassle for the extra few hours sleep!",3
4122,Does not fit properly on the curve of the phone's edges,3
4123,"Does not fit the entire screen, too small for the screen, sent back for refund.",3
4124,Does not fit the whole screen...but only part thereof and the screen is not protected in the edges.,3
4125,Does not shave as well as I would have hoped.,3
4126,Does not stick to the window very well. Comes adrift during the night. Have to fix it over the rail instead of the window. Looks good and does not crease.,3
4127,"does the job and very tough.  Only the tiniest niggle....the blue adhesive film provided in the pack for that final dust removal before applying the glass is too small...think its Iphone 4 size maybe, not Iphone 6.",3
4128,"Does the job but doesn't feel very secure when attached, jiggles the phone around when you drive.",3
4129,Does the job but it falls off the window very easily,3
4130,does the job but nothing special .,3
4131,Does the job I was expecting it to be a lot more accurate than it is I can say it's. About average it did its job,3
4132,Does the job to reasonable standard. Not very good when wet shaving but still cheaper and quicker than traditional wet shave with razor.,3
4133,"Does the job, be advised not heavy duty, quite flimsy, but if you just want it to cut paper/cardphotos in a nice straight line this will do it no problem and won't cost you a packet.",3
4134,"Does the job, but the suckers are rubbish, you only have to brush past and they pop off",3
4135,"Does the job, not expensive. For me it replaced an old, higher priced Philips triple head product. By comparison the Braun does not give as close a shave and is definitely not as comfortable to use.  If the budget is important, the Braun gives value, if you can spend more, a triple head product may be the better option.",3
4136,"Does the job,fast delivery",4
4137,Does the job! A big too big for our nursery and doesn't look attractive from the outside looking in but darkens the room and does its job!,3
4138,Does the job.,3
4139,"Does the job. Happy with purchase.I need to update this review. I have been using this screen protector for a few weeks now and I'm not sure if all screen protectors are the same but the touch screen seems to be very badly affected. Typing is fine but scrolling up and down the screen is a nightmare, I just give up. The last screen protector I had was very thin and maybe wasn't has protective but I didn't have these problems. It's so annoying, I feel like ripping the protector off.",3
4140,"Does the job. I've  use these twice, and on both occasions the glass has come away from the phone around the home button. Also, doesn't take much of a knock for the protector to crack.",3
4141,"Does the trick, but I have had some trouble keeping the suction cups stuck to the window.",3
4142,does what it states well,3
4143,Doesn't  fight iPhone 6s screen properly leaves gaps both sides,3

4145,Doesn't cover the full screen area of my iPhone 6.,3
4146,Doesn't cut as well as expected.,2
4147,"Doesn't get all spots, still having to use my normal shaver to get some parts. Does alright to 3 days worth or growth.",3
4148,Doesn't give me a close shave! Quite disappointing and I'll stick with my old Philips shaver!,3
4149,Doesn't quite fit the curved edges of the 6s's screen. This leads to visible gaps that allow dirt ingress between the protector and the screen.,3
4150,doesn't really fit for iPhone 6s,3
4151,Doesn't stay on windows,2
4152,Doesn't stick down the sides. Should be 5 mm slimmer.,3
4153,"Doesn't stick very well, falls down halfway through the night. Does its job when it does stick. Good as a temp fix",3
4154,Doesnt cover the entire phone. It covers only the screen.,3
4155,doesnt cut that well but still suffice for short trim.,3
4156,Don't clean as well as fragranced wipes,3
4157,Don't use now as it damaged (was able to fix) vents on my Peugeot 206.,3
4158,Don’t know if it s genuine product as it is packed different from the ones in supermarkets,3
4159,"Dose not shave the neck area very well, have to press far to hard, makes neck sore, and can cut",3
4160,dose what it says very good,5
4161,"Dreadfully dull and drawn out for the first 2/5 of the book. Almost gave up out of boredom.  But picks up after that.  The story is pretty improbable but novels do not have to be realistic.  Didn't love any of the characters and that may be why I was less satisfied with the plot (unrealistic plots are much more palatable when you like at least one of the protagonists) and the book. If the main characters had been a little more engaging, I think I would have enjoyed the book more.Definitely not the worst read I've ever had but left me a little lukewarm.",3
4162,"Dust magnet! Excellent instructions and method of application but the product itself isn't as good as a free tempered glass one I got with a cheap case. About 4mm left exposed around the edges, quite a lot, even after taking into consideration that no screen protector can provide 100% coverage of the screen.For this price the product isn't worth it. Money you spend is mainly on packaging.",3
4163,"Easy to apply and seems good quality. Fit for 6s isn't great, it struggles with slight curved edges on screen. Wondering if in time dust will collect under the edges which don't stick down.",3
4164,"Easy to apply but has not lasted well at all. Cracked with 3 weeks of use. Avoid these and stick to cheaper, more reliable plastic protectors!",3
4165,"Easy to apply however my first screen cracked on one corner after about 2 days. It doesn't affect the overall use so have yet to use the second screen to see how long it lasts. However, good value for money with 2 screens",3
4166,Easy to apply. However beware !!! Chips easily to the edges after a week or so. I think I'll go back to a Tech 21.,3
4167,Edges chip easily. Disappointed compared to protectors used on previous model of phone,3
4168,"Edit 17/8/18.Customer service very good, the seller replaced the phone holder with a different style (suction mount). This works very well.They went out of their way to do this free of charge.I bought this because of the other good reviews but I found it impossible to fit in 3 different cars. The connecting part is too chunky and wouldn't fit in between the fins of the vent. The one car it did fit onto the device was so heavy it would droop down and didn't feel secure.Pretty rubbish if you ask me.",3
4169,"Enjoyed this book. It was well written, but found the story a little difficult to buy in to and didn't find the twist as surprising or game changing as others have!",3
4170,"Events in this novel can never be taken at face value - things are not always what they seem. Always attentive to detail, Erin Kelly gets off to an impressive and powerful start. Throughout the novel the tone of the narrative conveys the underlying tension and often depressive atmosphere that mirrors the lot of each character’s life.From the point when Laura witnesses a scene of apparent sexual violence, the unique flaws of the individual characters set the inevitable wheels of the story in motion. Even with Laura who from the outset may be seen as a type of heroine, does have a distinct lack of sense of boundary with her spontaneous, rather astounding, judgemental claim of witnessing a rape. However strong her feeling that she is right, it is a personal, judgemental decision based on feeling and not concrete fact that catapults them all present on the scene into chaos. Reporting a violent assault to the police is one responsible thing to do - however, to say as a 3rd party that rape has occurred when not actually witnessed is another issue entirely, with Laura’s confabulation resulting in her jumping to conclusions.  Of course, if Laura had behaved more responsibly in her accusations, there wouldn’t have been a plot…!So, with the reader seeming to have a growing understanding of the personality traits of these characters, over time it is realised that this understanding is eventually turned on its head - Who is indeed bad news? It takes a long while for everything to come together, with some definite surprises on the way.I felt that the accompanying strand of eclipse chasing is unnecessary for the plot and for me didn’t add anything to it, aside from reflecting the cat and mouse game that is felt to be played out in the main theme. For me this made the novel too busy, more of a distraction and the novel may well have functioned better without this element. Also the unexpected surprise concerning one particular character should have jolted me, but it didn’t. It does gather much momentum towards the end with some highly dramatic moments at this point. I did finish the novel, but overall I wasn’t overwhelmed.",3
4171,Everything is good but the only bad point that i will highlight  is the battery .In less than 5 minutes I need to charge it again.,3
4172,"Excellent product that really does help prevent nappy rash, but it's extraordinarily over-priced. Similar products hat copy this type of 'water' wipe are just as effective.",3
4173,Expensive for what they are but works well. Hard to get just one wipe out the packet so end up wasting lots.,3
4174,"Extremely easy application. The glass protector only 'just' covers the LCD section of the phone. Curse of the curved screen I guess. But great value for money, a bargain to protect a valuable device.Edit: I bought a second pack of these. Easy to apply (still) however it isn't adhering around the edges. There's a consistent 2-3mm where it is lifting across the entire protector. Quite frustrating as it impacts visibility on the screen.",3
4175,"fab at cleaning but battery is poor, maybe 5 days from full to next recharge. Probably bluetooth eats battery up!",3
4176,Fab product but mine did unfortunately lose suction so I sent it back and went for the Medula,3
4177,"Fairly easy to put up and take down,suction pads work each time no probs, only thing is that you still get some light at edges no matter how carefully you attach the blind",3
4178,Fairly good but I'm not sure that it shaves as closely as my single foil very old Braun!,3
4179,fairly good will not buy another,3
4180,Fairly priced for double pack but one of them broke and splinters got stuck In grand-daughters hand,3
4181,"Falls off a lot, does black out when the suckers are working, but they often come away. Not really worth £20",3
4182,"Fantastic quality, strong resistance against scratches, extremely see through and does not impact usage of phone or screen brightness and colour contrast.On a bad note- doesn’t stick on edges as screen film is flat and phone has rounded edges, making it easy for all the debris to get under the unglued parts. If there would be a way to stick the edges properly then product would be spotless",3
4183,feel like not getting a clean shave,3
4184,Feels strong and protective but the edges haven't stuck down properly so doesn't look great,3
4185,"Felt it got a bit far fetch at the end, didn't quite ring true as a story though an easy read and page turner",3
4186,"few reasons why i dont use an electric shaver and get stuck using razor for a long time is because:1. I find it less clean  or less smooth and I always  got a ""patchy"" areas compare to razors.2. I get more cuts in the shaver, than my branded use razor,3. the old one that i had before (not a braun series) is not waterproof, which means I can only have a dry shave.4.being non waterproof means i cannot use a shaving foam, gel or cream, nor use it whilst in the shower,5. it needs an ample time cleaning it after every use, leave it and you'll got the dull feeling or less sharp cutting, thus, i ends up going back to razor.Trying the braun's latest shaver series  (Braun Series 9 9095CC) gives me a new concept about electric shaver and how  the latest technology in shavers gives you a closest feeling like a razor cut shave (though its not 100% and  not yet a total replacement for a wet razor shaving) at a shorter time.One thing you will noticed about it is the designed of the shaver.its fully flexible, waterproof  submersible (i know that now a days there are other few waterproof shaver) which means, no more worries even if your in the shower, drop it in the sink filled with water or running tap. the shaver got a precision trimmerand one i like most is the cleaning and charging dock- it means no more worrying of getting it clean for a length of time.also with its  digital LED display, it can indicates when charging is needed.But always, its a question of price. will i buy this for myself or a present for a closest one?At present, i say its a bit dear yet but if your going to count the number of time you'll have to buy and replace your razor, probably, it'll cost you a bit more, depending on your usage the number of users. spending 200 in one go for a shaver can be pricey, but  if the price will go down more in future time, definite, your getting a lot savings and its worth buying it.",3
4187,"First electric razor I've owned so don't have much to compare it with performance wise.Struggles with anything longer than stubble, but good for everyday use.The head does come off fairly easy though, I used it in the garden and afterwards tapped it on something to clear that hair out.The head fell off so picked it up and put it back on, next time I shaved with it I noticed the cutting part on the head was missing.This must have detached from the foil when it fell off, the problem now being you can buy replacement foils but not cutters so I had to buy a complete new replacement head costing almost as much as a complete new shaver.Not sure how that can really be so does spoil the whole thing a little.",3
4188,First electric shaver I've had and arrived on time. Not as good as a wet shave but ok nonetheless and after charge seems to last a long time.,3
4189,First time I've purchased one of these. Using for wedding stationary.  Perhaps it's me but I find it quite awkward to use.  The cutter isn't great have to go over it a few times for a clean cut and the arm needs quite a lot of pressure to keep the card in place. I'me sure there's a better one out there somewhere.,3
4190,Firstly when it arrived one of the toothbrush heads was missing. Amazon were fab and sorted that straight away. So onto the toothbrush - it's ok. It has different speed functions that I haven't used as I prefer the normal brushing speed/rotation. Also I haven't used the Bluetooth thing as I don't need to - the brush beeps and flashes green every 30 seconds (to remind you to move to a different mouth zone) so you know when 2 mins is up (the recommended brushing time). I purchased cheaper Oral-Bs for my sons and I don't really think this is any better than theirs. It does what it needs to do but I could have got something cheaper to do the exact same thing.,3
4191,Fit isn't great for 6s - a little on the small side and it's obvious it's on there but good protection on the whole,3
4192,Fit oks but does not feel 100% stable,3
4193,Fits ok with the Velcro adjustments being used. But the suckers do not stick well at all! Cleaned the windows a few times & even with wetting the suckers they still fall off!,3
4194,"Flimsy, could not cut up to 5 sheets as advertised. Cutting edge not very smooth.",3
4195,For me it didn't match up to all the hype despite it's unexpected twists and turns.,3
4196,"For month now I am reading book after book which stays behind my expectations. I am beginning to ask myself if it is my fault. Because this book is unfortunately one of those.The blurb says enough about the story. A young couple travels to a festival in Cornwall in 1999 to watch an eclipse. There they become whitenesswa of a rape. After that the life of many people changes forever.The story itself is very clever and complex. The problem is that every character is so very unlikable. Laura is extremely difficult. I found it hard to understand her in the past and in the present. I really did not get her anxious problems. And I could not understand Kit’s devotion for her. In the end I got it. But it is a long way to the end and the story drags and drags. The pace is extremely slow and sometimes the story gets lost. The thing about Kit’s father and his brother are not relevant for the story. As well is the background for Jamie, the rapist, not really necessary. It is just too much information. And Beth, a major character, is left in the dark. I really did not get why Kit and Laura lived in this total fear for 15 years.At first I found this thing about the eclipse chasers very interesting. But the chapters following Kit to his trip to the current eclipse are quite boring and of no meaning to the story. It just got lost on sideshows. The pace is often slowed down by chapters like this. The whole story seemed artificial. All narrators are unreliable. They are not telling things just to reveal them in the end. They all lie. This is clever and interesting but it is told so slowly. It just got boring because it was told so slowly. There is just too much in this book. At the end there is another twist. And another one. It is almost predictable.This book got a lot of ravenous reviews. Unfortunately I cannot comprehend. The idea is very good. But it is just too long, too dragging. The story gets lost. I had high expectations. But it is just too long, too tedious. The thing with the unreliable narrator is just overworked. There are one or two twists too much. I can see the brilliance of the idea, of the story itself. But it is somehow overworked. And the pace was so terrible slow. In hindsight it was a good and complex story, but the way to the end was quite a struggle.",3
4197,"For the money (if you get one cheap on a flash deal) this is good value. Nowhere nears as good as my old Philishave, but its fine as a spare. It copes with a few days growth well. It doesn't rip your hairs out like the Philishave.",3
4198,For the price and what this product claims to do I expected much better. I still feel it could clean teeth to remove plaque. You will need to keep flossing. Quite disappointing.,3
4199,For the price I suppose it's okay considering each head is £9.99 in stores and comes with 4 extra brush heads. The App is a pain cause who really has the time to connect every time they brush and check on the timer/which section they are brushing according to the app. Doing everything manually is calmer. I have a sonicare which I still use but sonicare brush heads don't reach the back teeth as well as this Oral B brush does. The booklet should be pictured rather numbered as you have no clue where you are looking. I see no modes on the toothbrush it's self just a up arrow that doesn't explain which mode is which.,3
4200,For three quarters or more of this book I was fully engaged and intrigued but I found the plot change to be slightly unbelievable and the novel therefore a little disappointing.,3
4201,"Found the central character so annoying, I gave up one-third of the way through!",3
4202,Found this helpful as I sleep poorly and the sun streaming in my bedroom window in the Summer doesn't help. I didn't measure the size I needed (silly I agree) so it is too long for my window but it comes with a bag and I took it to Spain and hotel holidays in the Irish Republic! Big size came in handy. It is light and portable. Just lick the suckers for much better grip/stickability!,3
4203,"Found this too complicated to set up. Would have preferred to alter settings on the brush rather than having to do it through smartphone app or little box (smartguide). You're supposed to take smartphone or smartguide box into bathroom while you use brush - without getting either wet!Takes 24 hours to charge up, and charge lasts 10 days. I don't have shaver socket in my bathroom and it doesn't come with an adapter plug, so have to buy that separately.Comes with 4 heads - 3D whitening, cross action, floss action, sensitive. 3D white head quite hard on the teeth and teeth didn't feel any cleaner or look any whiter than manual toothbrush, but maybe you need to use it longer to see a difference.Not a fan of electric toothbrushes - makes my head and teeth vibrate and reminds me of going to dentist! So will go back to manual toothbrush.",3
4204,"Generally a good shaver does small hairs too, posting was quick so overall a very good service, would definatly use them again.",3
4205,"Generally happy with the product only negative feedback is that a full charge does not last for 10 days. Lucky to get 6 days out of it, which is a pain when you travel.",3
4206,"Generally OK.  But the oleophobic coating, which is supposed to prevent fingerprints etc, does not work nearly as well as on other similar glass protectors I have used",3
4207,Get the cheaper £20 one. The motor is the same. The wireless stuff is gimmicky.,3
4208,"Getting the suction cups to stick can be an issue. When they do, it's wonderful - apart from a slight bit of light around the blind, it's pitch black! However, sometimes I can't get it to stick, and it's not uncommon for me to wake up and to find it half off. As such, if you can get it stuck well and leave it on 24/7 it's great, although having to reattach it every day is a bit of a hassle.",3
4209,"Given this is an iphone 6s case I feel it should cover the entire surface as the 5s cover does. However, it does cover most of the screen (very slight exposure on 1 edge) and so hopefully should do the job of protecting the screen",3
4210,Gives a decent shave,4
4211,Good at blocking out light but half of the suckers were bent from packing and suction wouldnt work on those particular ones so the curtain wasnt secure,3
4212,"Good blackout blind when it stays put, but it can be hard to attach the suction cups well - they often fall down.",3
4213,"Good book and gripping throughout. However, I figured out the twist fairly early on.",3
4214,"Good book, I was enjoying it for a while until three quarter way through and I got a bit bored. Didn't like the end it didn't add up with the characters at all.",3
4215,"Good brush which keeps teeth clean,but battery life is average, no where near the 10 days claimed. On a full charge I am lucky to get 3/4 days max before it starts to slow, and on one occasion it dies completely after 2 days. The app thing is a waste of time so I deleted it pretty much straight away, but the timer is cute and helps to ensure you stay the course. Battery life aside these toothbrushes are excellent and way better than using a manual brush.",3
4216,Good but battery doesn't seem to last much over a week,3
4217,"Good but doesn't stick to the window all night, fabric is a bit heavy and doesnt hold when it is in the folded/concertina version for smaller windows. Otherwise it does keep most of the light out, but starts to let in in parts.",3
4218,Good but expensive...,4
4219,"Good but not great, in my experience. Works well on my face where the hair is less dense but under my chin and around my throat it's insuffiecient and I have to use a razor afterwards.",3
4220,Good but not great. Had it for less than 2 months now & got a small chip already.,3
4221,Good but not great. Still need to use normal blades as well.,3
4222,"Good but sometimes confusing read, i found it hard to relate to the main character but once i pushed past that i really enjoyed the book. definitely keeps you on your toes until the very end!!",3
4223,Good but still let's some light in the sides but does make a huge difference in the very light summer nights,3
4224,Good but wish they were biodegradable,3
4225,"Good characterisation; almost felt like I knew them and wanted to know more about them and that's largely behind my enjoyment of the book. A slow build up that picks up pace. Interesting format, with sections written as a diary by the two main characters forwards and backwards in time. Somehow though, it felt amateurish in places, but that's not to take away too much from a decent read. Not wishing to stereotype as there are exceptions to every rule, I'd say this book is aimed at, or would appeal more to, the female reader. The ending was a bit of an anti-climax, and even slightly annoying, probably appealing a lot to the petty mindset of persons scorned.",3
4226,"Good cleaning power but the handle is poorly designed, not ergonomic, very slippery. It's almost impossible to brush teeth one handed.Also, the 1st one I received had a fault: the battery doesn't always fully charge after charging for 48hrs. The replacement toothbrush seems to be OK so far.",3
4227,Good concept and effect black out but the suckers always fall off it's annoying,3
4228,"good concept however the suckers don't always work, every time we have used this, in the morning at least one part of the blind has fallen down.",3
4229,Good fabric but that's about it. It doesn't stick.,3
4230,Good fit. Instructions on packaging very hard to read as so tiny. Disappointed the cleaning cloth was dry not moist impregnated with cleansing solution. First attempt following guide loads of dust particles still on screen so bubbles between screen & protector. Thankfully as twin pack the second attempt was better as I used a glasses wipe first.,3
4231,"Good for a portable guillotine and to use with the kids, but I found it very light in weight hard to cut through more than 3 sheets of paper and thats with applying pressure.",3
4232,"good for small cuts, make sure you practice with it first at the cut is not where indicated on the measure marks.wont cut more then 3 sheets straight (the blade seems to tip, and then cuts them all different)",3
4233,Good for the cost,4
4234,"Good for the price, and useful (if like me) you struggle to find time to shave before leaving for work. It doesn't offer the closest shave. You need to pay  attention as you can find yourself with a rather patchy result if you hurry it.",3
4235,"Good for travelling & good for extra blackout behind curtains but on its on it doesn't completely blackout unless your window is completely square & doesn't differ in the middle. The suckers work 80% of the time but you really have to press them on hard, sometimes they fall down during the night.",3
4236,"good glass, good shape and size. Some glue all around the glass edge attract dust and it is not well clean",3
4237,"Good holiday read, with the end not as obvious or tidily 'wrapped up' as in many other books of this ilk.",3
4238,Good in theory but it's cracked after less than a week. I have not banged or dropped the phone in any way for it to warrant cracking.Guess you get what you pay for. Won't be buying again that's for sure,3
4239,Good job there was 2 in the packet has one off these shattered while trying to fit it and the instructions could have been a little better,3
4240,"good paper trimmer.only one problem there are no replacement blades,i would not have purchased this had i been aware.i now have a paper trimmer only 3 months old that cannot be used.",3
4241,Good price but the water wipes are too wet baby don't like them,3
4242,"Good price. Does the job, but not as good as the more expensive models. Just watch that you don't get caught signing up to Amazon Prime. I did and am usually very careful. I then had to go through the hassle of cancelling.",3
4243,Good product and no problems applying to iPhone 6s. The only comment I would make is the dust remover supplied with product when applying the screen protector did not fit an iPhone 6s screen and would probably only fit a iPhone 4 or iPhone 5. Other than this though no problems at all with the product itself.,3
4244,Good product but came with one of the power level LEDs not working.,3
4245,"Good product but the battery life isn’t great, have to recharge it every week, despite being advertised as lasting for two weeks",3
4246,"Good product does as I want it to do, Doesn't rotate though",3
4247,"Good product IF it lasts for a reasonable length of time (say 3 years plus). Charge, however only lasts for approximately 30 minutes though. Always found this problem with razor manufacturers over statements, similar to car mileage boasts! Overpriced, probably worth about £140.00.",3
4248,Good product just a little difficult to put on with the instructions but will give maximum protection,3
4249,"Good product. However, I'm very clumsy and drop my phone all the time and the screen protector didn't protect my phone for long because of the amount of times I drop it",3
4250,"Good product.Great price.Only thing letting itself down is the size, it doesn't cover my whole screen, and when I look at it from the side of my phone, it has weird colours due to the refraction of white light.",3
4251,Good productVery slow deliverymay be ok by now,3
4252,Good protection for iPhone 6. Could do with being slightly larger to cover screen but adequate.,3
4253,"Good protection, application fiddly and used first one up, as had air bubbles I could not get rid of. Second attempt worked OK but does not stick completely at the edges. I think they give you two in the pack as they know it will take two attempts!  One of the better ones on the market but far from perfect",3
4254,"Good purchase, the suction cups need hot water on each use to help them stick.",3
4255,Good quality but I think i'm going to cut it to fit my child's bedroom windows. It's a pain to have to repeat the process every night: unfold it and try to get the suction cups stuck to the window. You have to put a lot of pressure to get them secured to the glass.,3
4256,"Good quality screen protector and much easier to apply than the film ones, (won't use those again), but this one is smaller than the iPhone 6S screen so there is a few millimetres gap from the edge of the screen to the protector, probably due to the curve on the edge of the screen but still the protector seems a bit small.",3
4257,"Good quality, protects the screen.  However, as the screen is slightly curved at the edges and the protector is flat, the protector doesn't fit properly leaving an area at the edges that you can see is not in full contact with the screen, maybe 1mm top and bottom and 2mm at the sides.  This is protecting my screen while I look for a better-fitting alternative.",3
4258,Good read and well written but a bit slow,3
4259,Good read if at times a little complicated plot wise but once you get in to it good book,3
4260,"Good screen protector - easy enough to apply onto phone. BUT, one of the protectors (since it came in two) was already cracked! Kinda want half of my money back since I technically only paid for one functioning screen protector.",3
4261,Good screen protectors although one out of two arrived cracked in half so only got to use one of them!,3
4262,Good story that keeps you turning the pages. A few blind alleys that could have been given more detail. The denouement is a bit cliched but if this was a TV series you would watch it all the way through.,3
4263,"Good storyline which hooks you early on and then takes you on a roller coaster ride right until the end, with plenty of twists and turns along the way, both expected and unexpected. Unfortunately, I found aspects of the plot simply too implausible and that's what let it down for me ultimately. However, still an enjoyable holiday read. Wouldn't be at all surprised if they decide to make a film based on the plot and storyline.",3
4264,Good tempered glass. and very good price.But does not cover the whole of the phone screen. See attached pictures,3
4265,Good to block light out but kept falling down from my window.,3
4266,"Good to block the sun, but the connectors keep falling. Plus it absorbs lots of the heat making the room too hot",3
4267,Good toothbrush but Bluetooth is pointless. Save the money and get cheaper one without it.,3
4268,good toothbrush but regarding battery life it doesn't stay for long and it will take really long time rechargeOral-B Smart Series 6500 CrossAction Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush with Bluetooth Connectivity and Smart Series Powered by Braun (Packaging May Vary) - Ships with 2 pin UK plug,3
4269,Good used once never uded since. Its fiddly and suckers dont work,3
4270,good value,4
4271,Good value but not as closer shave as I would have liked.,3
4272,"good value but not very robost, could easly break as it is filmsy. it does do the the jobbut build quality could be improved",3
4273,"Good when it works, have 2 broken pumps from this brand. Won't get another",3
4274,Good when you can put them on properly. I couldn't I just kept getting bubbles,3
4275,"Good wipes, very expensive for what it is. They also clump together when pulling them out",3
4276,"Good: Material is good and very portable.Bad: The suction cups used to attach to the window are not very good at all, I've had to find extra ways of securing to the window.",3
4277,"Got this on a lightning deal, good toothbrush but they are getting silly with Bluetooth etc. Does not keep a charge for many brushings and takes ages to charge. While I like the Oral B toothbrushes, I would go for a model without the Bluetooth feature as this uses up the battery reserve.",3
4278,Got this screen protector for my iphone 6s. It leaves a couple of millimeters short at both the top and bottom of screen but will still give decent enough protection.,3
4279,"Got this shaver to replace 5 year old philips .Still using the philips,did not think much of braun.",3
4280,"Got this when it started getting lighter, for the little one's room. In theory it's a great idea however the fabric is heavy and putting it up was a bit cumbersome. In our case not all the suction bits worked so the blind kept falling down. For this reason we decided not to hang on to it",3
4281,Got this yesterday great toothbrush but shame about the SmartGuide which has a faulty display. Half the display is not showing. changed the batteries to see if that was the problem but to avail. Really disappointed that I am unable to use it fully.,3
4282,"Got two of them to replace the old ones. They work well, smily face is a good to make you control how often you should brush your teeth but.... after nearky 5 months of using it we have to charge it every few days. Also it does take fairly long time to fully charge it so do not think it will charge just ocer a night.",3
4283,"Got two screens in the pack, one was faulty and the other was fine hence the 3-star review.",3
4284,Great at the job of brushing but the charger seems rather temperamental - would have expected better for the price.,3
4285,"Great delivery, clear instructions and really easy to apply - no bubbles at all! Although it doesn't get 5 star as the edges of the screen protector aren't down, there appears to be air around the edge, so I did it again and made sure to push the edges right away but they still do not stick. It isn't a huge problem but can look imperfect. Only been on for a few days so I can't rate its strength on protecting my screen but looks like it would do a good job.",3
4286,Great idea but not all of the suction cups actually stick to the glass despite vigorous cleaning of both surfaces. If all of the suction cups worked this would rate much higher!,3
4287,"Great idea, it does work, but sometimes its hard to get the sucker bits to stick!",3
4288,"Great material makes a v good blackout effect and excellent for travel as its lightweight and packs up small, but not big enough for our windows and the suction cups don't always stick despite washing out windows thoroughly, washing the cups, making them damp before sticking and pressing them on very hard! Quite long winded to put up each night.",3
4289,"Great product and fitting kit, but about 1/2 a mm too big around the edge. Getting full contact on the 6S screen is near impossible. Could be that the tempered protector is just too rigid?Minor issue, just depends how much of a perfect fit you want.",3
4290,Great product but it doesn't fit the 6s very neatly - there's quite a big gap to the edge.,3
4291,"great product BUT. The android app asked for access to your pictures, contacts and microphone...Why???",3
4292,Great product if I could get it to work. The suckers are useless some stuck some didn't this was ok 3 windows in 3 different houses.,3
4293,"Great product. I took water wipes to hospital and they worked well on sticky meconiam. They're really moist and only having something like 2 ingredients. My baby is very sensitive and never had a bad reaction to these. Having searched around, they are being sold at similar prices elsewhere now but it's a good deal. I won't be ordering wipes online again becuase my box arrived with a soaking wet corner. One of the packets hadn't been sealed and had leaked everywhere. I was desperate for wipes so couldn't return. Expensive mistake. I'm sure most people won't have the same problem but it's put me off and lowered my rating. A great wipe to use. I recommened getting the bigger packs for better value.",3
4294,Great product.... would have give five stars only charger stopped working after 2-3 weeks.,3
4295,"Great product.I have given a 3 rating due to the technical issues listed below. Otherwise a great product at good price.Just a couple of things to watch out for:1) the screen installation stickers come off while putting the screen so not much help there. It would be great if this could be improved2) the cut out for the camera - it would help if this is made slightly bigger or removed completely. Reason being, in it’s current state there is a chance you would get a shadow in any of the corners while using the phone even if there is a slight shift while installing this product (probability of that being very high since the stickers may come off during installation)",3
4296,"Great Screen protect and have a lot of faith it will keep the screen safe. However is smaller than the overal face of the phone, wish it covers all of the face rather than just the screen",3
4297,Great service from supplier however protector screen is very difficult to stick on screen,3
4298,Great suction.....but for some reason the adaptor to use to plug in did not work at all. Had to use batteries which did not last as it is a high power device.,3
4299,Great value but wipes don't pull out of the pack well so that you end up with a whole bunch of them coming out at once. This means you go through lots more of them so the saving is negligible.,3
4300,"Great value, but you ultimately get what you pay for. After being spoiled by using the more premium end of the market products (Apple iPad mini) my gripes are about the screen quality, responsiveness, recharging takes an age - far too long by modern standards, general lack of intuitiveness in the user interface, and biggest of all: no Youtube or Youtube kids. My 6 y.o. daughter doesnt seem to mind too much, but even she gravitates to our iPhones and iPad when they are free in preference and she is not a brand snob!",3
4301,Great when works but very hard to make all the pads stick to the glass and some fall off repeatedly. It’s okay at best but wouldn’t have bought if I got to try first.,3
4302,"Great wipes - my daughter rarely gets nappy rash compared with my sons who used a supermarket own brand.However 1) the already very expensive wipes have gone down from 72 to 60 wipes.2) they have shrunken in size?3) when you have a wriggle-monster toddler, who won't allow you to clean their poo-splattered bottom. These wipes are a real PAIN in the backside (pun intended) to get out of the packet. They don't 'pop-up like other leading brands. You end up fighting a losing battle with either toddler or wipes.",3
4303,"Great wipes, but they're not ""chemical free""They contain water, and whatever multitude of chemicals are in the fruit extract.",3
4304,Great wipes. Colder than other wipes though. Not sure why so expensive if 99% water!,3
4305,"Great! A little fiddly to put on, and I wish it would actually fit the entire front face of the phone, and that it didn't now take two or so taps to type some letters, but other than that its good!",3
4306,Gripping at first but failed to sustain interest. Worked out ending quite soon,3
4307,"Had a few covers from JETech for my iPhone 5s and they were perfect, however with the 6s I've tried both that came in the packet and neither seem to be measured quite right to take into account the bevelled edge of the iphone 6s screen, so you end up with light lines down the edges where the protector doesn't quite adhere properly.Will leave this one on for now but will probably end up buying another one from a different company to see if i can get one that has a perfect fit.",3
4308,had issues with bible forming on placement of the screen this time,3
4309,Had lot better ones in the past and this one is very hard to fit,3
4310,"Had problems with the pressure sensor, read lots of reviews online so did all the thing suggested on the manufacturers website. It still plays up from time to time. Not tried to return the brush, next time I need a toothbrush I'll use a high street store so that I can exchange for a new one if faulty.",3
4311,Had some difficulty placing both the protectors on my iPhone as they kept attracting dustGot sent replacements and have now almost done a perfect job but for 1 little dust specBugger !!,3
4312,"Had this for a while now, and can report that it does give a fantastic shave - nice and close and no excessive irritation. The Clean & Charge unit does what it says on the tin and keeps the shaver in perfect condition.All fine so far... As I say, had this for a while and it's getting towards the time where a new shaving head needs to be sourced. Now the problem starts - THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT SHAVING HEADS AVAILABLE, seemingly, anywhere in Europe, for this shaver. Not even directly from Braun.I want to say nice things about this, but frankly, it looks like Braun are suckering their customers - £200+ for a shaver that you'll have to bin when the shaving head stops performing properly after 18 months or so.I would sugeest anyone thinking of buying one of these seriously reconsiders - before you make a potentially expensive mistake.",3
4313,Had to add Velcro to the window in order to maintain a good fit.,3
4314,Had to buy them again after giving one away and my protecting cracking on the edge in the middle of all places. No idea how it's happened. Has chipped away!,3
4315,"Had to have a replacement as the first one only lasted a few months, the toothbrush developed a fault and would not charge.  Its a good toothbrush and you can really see the difference in your teeth after a few weeks.  I would opt for a cheaper version as the bluetooth app is really redundant. (who needs an app to help clean your teeth)  Easy to use, would be 4 star if my last one hadn't gained a fault.",3
4316,"Had to look up the female equivalent of misogynist - misandrist. If you have little regard for men and think that generally they're at best spineless and at worst vicious then this is the book for you. Other than that, good storyline but lazily written; discrepancies in dates etc had me confused (something happens in January in one chapter then in another it happened in June) and the word lie only has 3 letters not 4, unless there was some deep meaning too obscure for me to get.",3
4317,"had to return item, unfortunately, it didn't do what was required for my husband, as it didn't have a trimmer,my fault ordered incorrect item",3
4318,Half the suction cups don't work but we hung it over the curtain track and taped it to the window and it definitely keeps the light out,3
4319,Handy but be careful if you have the car blower on hot as it it'll heat up the phone thats sitting in front of it (common sense i guess),3
4320,Handy for convenience but doesn't shave nearly as good as a wet shave. 5 mins after finishing I always seem to find odd strands that have been missed; going over and over my face to try and avoid this and it would appear that I can take just as much time as I would with a wet shave. Haven't tried it in the shower yet as I haven't sourced any oil for maintenance.,3
4321,Hard to get into and not enough story. Ok holiday read but not a can't put down book. Easy read,3
4322,Hard to get into at first then not a bad read,3
4323,hard to get into to much jumping around,3

4326,"Have used water wipes intermittently for over 3 years, recently ordered new batch after my last bulk order was finished but I was really disappointed to discover the size of the wipes have been considerably reduced!! They also seem less wet than the old ones.Overall it's a great product especially for new borns as all the other popular wipes on the market seem to be overloaded with nasties but giving it 3 stars for the reduction in size and quality.",3
4327,"Having been a devotee of Braun electric razors for many years I had no hesitation to replace my last shaver with this Series 3 model. I also have a 5 series model which I use daily and this new acquisition was bought mainly for travelling. Imagine my dismay after the first use, removing the head to clean the body and foils to find that the 3 independent foils fell out of the head.  There are no instructions in the box apart from endless disclaimers and hypothetical idiots guide for use of electrical products which are there to endlessly bore us to death. So my brand new razor was in 4 separate pieces in my hand and wondered if I would ever be using it again as every attempt to put it together failed and the air was blue. After walking away to regain my composure I tried to reconstruct using my gut feeling and a [process of illumination asto which way round the two outer independently sprung foils fitted. I managed to get it working again but to this day one of the sprung foils works and the other is jammed in and I dare not try to loosen it for fear of it disrupting the whole configuration once again. This clearly is a major design fault as I have never been confronted with such a complex assembly for something which should be so simple.Buyers beware a replacement head assembly is over £16.00 !",3
4328,"Having had this for a few months………….. The toothbrush is obviously well made and robust and has a very substantial feel to it. The LED display/timer is great, it would be particularly useful for children because it has a little smiley face. However the big drawback is the battery life, which is very poor. It certainly doesn’t last a week and I would be expecting a toothbrush at this price and quality to have a battery that would last a couple of weeks without recharging. As soon as you take it off the recharging unit and use it, it’s already down to 2 bars and this is a battery which is only a few months old. I expect the battery life to only get worse. They should really address this problem.",3
4329,"Having previously used the Braun Cooltec series, I can say that this isn't as good at the basics. That is, shaving. It has trouble with 24 hours worth of stubble, and even two days worth will take several passes to remove. For a quick and complete shave you need three days or more. I would say it takes about twice as long to shave after 1-2 days than the more expensive models. Battery life is good and recharging time is as you would expect, so no problems there. It all comes down to the cost, as this is about a third the cost of the Cooltec shavers like the CT2.Personally I'd pay the extra money.",3
4330,"Having read that this cutter has an ""A4 guide arm"", I didn't realise that it only cuts A4 paper across the short side, it's not big enough to cut A4 paper lengthways. Otherwise, while pretty basic, it does what it's meant to and certainly cuts card better than I can with a pair of scissors. Quite adequate for using on photos.",3
4331,"Having used a Philips rotary previously I expected to have to adjust my shaving technique with the Braun but, 6 months later, I'm giving up and returning to a Philips. The shaver takes many more passes to achieve a close shave, especially around the mouth area and can leave the skin hot and a little sore.",3
4332,"He Said/She Said, starts off in the present day and throughout has flashbacks to fifteen years ago when Laura witnesses a young woman being raped.From the start (fifteen years later) you know that pregnant Laura and her partner Kit are scared of someone, but you don’t know why. The mystery continues for most of the way through the book, and to be honest when the answer was revealed I was a little let down at waiting all that time for something that didn’t seem worth it. Yes I understood why they were hiding, but I wanted something more explosive to be the answer.The book at times felt forced and padded out with too much descriptiveness at what was in the surrounding area, or how one of the characters felt. I was interested in the story and at the start, captivated by the mysterious element of wondering why they would be so scared of someone, especially when you find out who, but not why. This did perk my interest, as I couldn’t logically understand how that could be. As I said this went on for far too long, as the secrets were revealed very slowly.The final chapters came with a massive twist to the book which surprised me as I was certainly not expecting it.Erin’s writing is superb. The jumping back and forth in time was done so that you knew exactly which time period you were in. Had there been more information earlier on I most likely would have enjoyed this book far more than I did. As it stands, it was a little dull until nearly everything was revealed. I found I was forcing myself to read it, rather than wanting to read it.Book Reviewed on Whispering Stories Book Blog*I received a free copy of this book, which I voluntarily reviewed",3
4333,Heard lots of good stuff but more than one comes out. But it did the job and left baby's bottom clean.,3
4334,"Heard this was good and considering it has 99% of water, why use anything else on your baby's bum!?! Will be using this in August",3

4337,"Hi there, I bought this item and put the first screen protector on my phone. I am very happy with it. However, my partner then went on to use the second screen protector and it was cracked at the top. If I could possibly send it back and be sent 1 other screen protector as the other one is on my phone.Kind regardsDanielle",3
4338,"Hi, screen protector is fine, only issue is that I meant to get one for the iPhone 6s PLUS not the normal 6s. That however is my own fault!",3

4340,"Hmm not bad I suppose but if I want blackout that means zero light. Light still gets in around the sides but it does help on a window where the sun is directly shining on it. I think if I painted the window black as well or better still bricked it up, then I would get nearer the desired blackoutness. Then again a pile of bricks aren't as portable as a fabric blind",3
4341,"Hmmm seemed ok initially and hadn't been damaged in transit. However, was a little tricky/fiddly to put on my phone (and im a 28 year old who likes to think she is pretty down with technology!). It cracked a tiny bit bottom left of the screen within the first week (and i dont think this was the result of a fall!) so quite annoying, especially as there is now a lovely air bubble there that i cant get rid of... :-/",3
4342,Holds the phone really well but does not stay in my vents - Ford B MaxAfter my review I was contacted by the sellers customer service team who replaced the item. Great service and the replacement item is much better,3
4343,I am a Braun fan. My old razor was Braun. This razor is better albeit that may be that the shaving heads are newer and sharper. I get good running time from the battery and it charges quickly. Not sure that I like the ergonomics. Seems bulky to hold. All tha being said it is value for money but not exceptional.,3
4344,"I am an avid lover of psychological thrillers and 98% of the time I find them quite predictable but the suspense some of those have built up in reaching the end has been worth it.  This is, sadly, predictable and an extremely slow burn.  I felt as if the story was still being set up at 75% of the way through because not much had happened until then, other than what the blurb reveals.  At 75% SOMETHING happened or rather, was revealed to have happened but I could see it coming miles beforehand and don't understand why it wasn't revealed earlier  (to pad the book out I suppose).I normally read a good thriller in about 1-4 days max.  This took me nearly 2 weeks to read.  I read regularly at night in bed before falling asleep, often not wanting to put a book down.  But this book was the reason I WAS falling asleep, sometimes without even getting through a whole chapter.I'm not against eclipses and am sure I'd enjoy a good non fiction book about them but in this story, they only served as a reason for the male character to travel I thought.  One other reviewer mentioned the eclipses were a metaphor for the character traits ..... NOT for me!  The story could just have easily been set around music festivals or even travellers!It's told from the perspective of the two, married, main characters but is very jumpy back and forth and not in entirely chronological order either.  For example, close to the end, Laura's chapter is set on 30 September 2015.  The next chapter is also Laura's, set on 28 September 2015 .... ie, just two days beforehand!  Where the chapters had previously jumped between 2015 and 1999 and often alternated the characters, that was a bit confusing so I had to pay attention to the years AND DATES which I don't want to have to do with a thriller. I don't mind jumping years, but not just 2 days beforehand!It gets better for the last quarter but again is very predictable.  There could only be two endings really so I suppose BOTH would have been predictable.  I liked the ending but not how quickly it just seemed to suddenly finish.Am so glad I've finished it now (for both the time I've taken and finally, an end to the story) .. and can now move onto something hopefully a little more up my street.  I wouldn't rush out to buy other books by this author either as I have done with others.  Obviously from many other reviews, this is up a lot of people's streets, just not mine.",3
4345,I am disappointed. The film is too thick for my liking and isn't covering the entire screen of the iPhone 6s.,3
4346,I am hoping it is going to save me from an expensive repair but it has made the screen less touch sensitive so I am making lots of spelling mistakes and having to get used to more pressure.,3
4347,I am unhappy because the SmartGuide not working.,3
4348,I bought 2 of these blinds to use in the baby's room (which has 2 windows). I leave one up permanently and that one has been fine but the one I take down every day is always falling down (and often waking up the baby). It has helped but I am disappointed that it doesn't stay up as well as it should.,3
4349,"I bought a couple of these boxes for my newly born as they are water based and have no nasty additives, and they worked quite well. However, with the second order, the wipes did not seem to be very moist. I don't know if I got a bad batch, but did not buy them since - just moved to normal wipes you can get in supermarkets (Simple is my favourite - very moist and added chamomile to soothe skin).",3
4350,I bought a new toothbrush as the battery would give up so easily. This new one has similar problems - you charge forever and the battery may last days or not. The brush is great but on reflection this package was overkill.,3
4351,"I bought one of these products back in October 2015. It lasted me until June 2016. For that reason its not a bad deal considering the price. They definitely do the job. So I have bought another pack of two but unfortunately after applying one of the screen protectors, within 3-4 days started coming away from the screen. I have now put the second one on. Its been 2 days so I am hopeful it will last. For the price they are good, I just hope it will last.",3
4352,I bought the screen protector for an iPhone 6s but the blue dust film included in the package was for an iPhone 5 and was too small for the screen.  However I did manage to clear the screen by moving it and pressing it on again.  Not ideal!  In the end I applied the protector onto the screen and there is a very small bubble at the top of the screen which I'm not sure will affect the overall adhesion.  I would appreciate someone getting back to me.  Thanks,3
4353,"I bought these (the big box, yes, stupid...) for my days old baby as I was fed up boiling water, waiting for it to cool and using cotton wool balls, what a faff, but didn't want chemically wipes.The wipes themselves are fantastic; very moist, don't tear, clean very well, have kept nappy rash at bay.But there is a massive design flaw in that the wipes are hard to get out of the packet, and aren't arranged so the next one comes up too. The flap to pull out is never directly under the hole in the packet, so you have to root around trying to get a hold of the wipe, and other brands have them arranged like tissues so you pull one out and the next one is ready to be pulled up too.It might seem like a small issue but if you're holding a baby covered in crap you really want wipes that can be quickly pulled out!Huggies Pure wipes are better, purely because of their arrangement of the wipes.If the company fixed this I'd go back to them, and I'd give them 5 stars.",3
4354,"I bought these as they were half the price of the one I'd bought previously and the reviews seemed largely positive. They do the job and come really well packaged but I personally feel they're just a bit too small. They're markedly smaller than ones I've had previously for iPhone 6. They cover the screen but only just, there is no margin; it actually sits on the edge of the screen so if your phone is at an angle you get a rainbow effect down the side.For the price, these are ok but I wouldn't get again due to size.",3
4355,"I bought these because of the good reviews and recommendations from friends. I love the fact that they are chemical free and that alone would deserve 5 stars.The reason why I gave these 3 stars is because these wipes contain too much water, making them too wet and cold to use on my baby's bum. Every time we use these wipes our baby starts crying because they are too wet and cold.If they contained a bit less water they wouldn't get so cold and would be more gently on the baby.",3
4356,"I bought these for my baby and although they are soft and do the job, they are nothing special. Aldis mammia sensitive wiped are equally as good on his skin, and equally as soft, and are a third of the price at 64p for 64 wipes. Save your cash and buy them instead",3
4357,"I bought these when they were on for £20 a box of 12, so quite cheap, no problems apart from they were a bit rough and i think may have been part of the reason my baby got a slight nappy rash. I recently ordered a box from Superdrug and immediately saw the difference between them and the ones i bought from Amazon. First, they were packed upside down inside the box so the liquid was evenly through the pack and not sitting at the bottom of the packet soaking the last few wipes. Secondly, the Superdrug ones were soo much softer, so thats put me off ordering them off here again coz its made me a bit suspicious. Id advise people to buy them from a shop you can trust.",3
4358,I bought this as an audible book as I had a long car journey ahead of me and needed something to keep me going.  It kept my interest on the journey but I think if I had been reading it I would have given up long before it really began to get interesting.  The first half is very long and drawn out jumping backward and forwards in time.  I found the characters hard but possible because I am a 'get on with it' sort of person and they all seemed to be very introspective.  Consequently I couldn't really relate or feel any sympathy for any of them.  This was perhaps made worse because I found the voice the narrator used very 'wishy washy'.  (I can't think of another word to describe it).  I think the best thing I can say about the story is that it has stayed with me and made e think enough to write this review.,3
4359,"I bought this as I wanted to know what constituted a Sunday Times bestseller. It's not my usual genre but I was getting bored with poorly written military thrillers. To me it was rather like running a half-marathon with my 50lb pack on my back. One starts off full of confidence. By the third mile you're not quite so comfortable, by halfway you're wondering why you ever started it, by mile nine you're gritting your teeth but are determined not to give up and by the end you're just glad it's over.The thrust of the story was about a dysfunctional couple of eclipse chasers who witness a rape in Cornwall at an eclipse gathering in the 1990s. The storyline flits back and forth between the two MCs and flashes back between the years as their lives develop. The 'he said. she said', title stems from the court case when the accused has one story and the victim, with her two witnesses, another.It is a well-written story with very few editorial errors but, for me, far from engaging. Most of the characters lacked any form of attractiveness; each was fully self-absorbed with their own problems and appeared to live on another planet from mainstream Britain.I don't know about 'shocking twists' as much of what happened at the end was signalled well in advance and there was no surprise at the various outcomes. I'm not going to spoil it for others but I was far from 'gripped' and ever-so slightly disappointed with the whole construction of the book.",3
4360,I bought this black out blind to help our 4month old nap in the day partially.It is large so can fit many suze windows but doesn't sticl partically well onto our windows do lets lights come through.A shame the print is a light pink and not simply white as our little one is a boy.and would fit over large windows.Hope it will come in more useful of using it when travelling.,3
4361,"I bought this for my 2 year old son and I'm really impressed with the whole package. A years free access to all the viceos, books and apps is great and has been keeping him interested since its purchase.However, yesterday I took the tablet out with us for him to play with whilst we having lunch in a restaurant.  He loves playing puzzles and using the drawing apps so I was disappointed to note that his favourite apps were not available offline.  One of the key selling points inferred you don't need to be connected to a WI-FI network to enjoy the functionality of the tablet.  This is true for videos as you can download them prior to leaving your network, but it appears the apps (of at least the ones he uses) require an internet connection even though they've already been downloaded to the tablet tablet.Very disappointing.  A fantastic product completely let down by a false/misleading headline.",3
4362,I bought this for my husband when his old razor died.  He said it does the job - but does not give him as close a shave as his older Braun razor.,3
4363,I bought this product as I was making a scrapbook and although it is not the best product it did what I needed it to do and was great for a student on a budget!,3
4364,"I bought this screen protector for the iPhone 6s, as per other reviews it does not reach the edges due to the curve,which is slightly annoying as the dust collects between the gap of the screen protector and case. To be honest I don't think this would be fixed whatever screen protector I purchased as it is the phone design limitations!The pack included two screen protectors, dust cloth and clear instructions.No problem attaching to the phone and looked great, however after two weeks it has lifted in the top corner of the phone and it has a bubble.Based on the cost and the fact two screen protectors were included I think it was probably quite a good purchase, hopefully the next cover will not lift on the corner.",3
4365,"I bought this shaver 3 years ago, it gives a fairly good shave but not quite so good on the neck and upper lip.One charge lasts me about 4 weeks, foil/cutters last about 18 months before needing replacement .First replacement foil/cutters cost £17 now need to buy a foil/cutter and find they are over £26, that is a huge mark up in price considering the whole unit is only £50 so have gone back to my old Philishave  micro plus shaver where a pack of 3 genuine cutter are £9 or £16 for cutters and foils, I have also found it gives a better shave than the Braun on the neck and upper lip",3
4366,"I bought this to replace a far more expensive razor which was dropped.It's just not as good as a £150 razor, but can you really expect it to be? Without a moving foil, there are often little areas of hair in hard to reach areas which are quite difficult to shave - I think that is simply going to be a flaw with this model which I have to live with.The ability to wet shave with this was a novelty, but one I quickly grew bored of as it consistently missed a few hairs and although easy on the skin, it is significantly more time consuming than dry shaving.",3
4367,"I bought this to replace my 5 series Braun shaver and the 9095 provides a much faster shave, taking about one third of the time that would be required with my old shaver. However, the end result is about the same for both shavers in terms of closeness of shave, certainly inferior to a wet shave. It is slightly misleading to market the 9095 as a wet and dry shaver as it cannot be used with foam or gel. However, it can be used in the shower and can be washed under the tap after use. I was also disappointed to find that, unlike my old shaver, there is no protective cover to protect the foil, nor is it possible to run it off the mains using the cord, should it run out of charge when away from home. Overall, it is difficult to justify the extra cost of the 9095 in comparison with cheaper shavers.",3
4368,"I bought this to replace my 5000 whose battery needed constant recharging. I ploughed through many reviews before making my purchase but ended up more confused as to which brush to buy. I decided to go with ""you get what you pay for"".However do we need an all singing all dancing brush and will a cheaper model clean your teeth just as well ? These are questions that are never answered.The brush cleans your teeth well but the timer on the 5000 was much clearer on when each 30 seconds had elapsed and if like me your mind tends to wander when you are cleaning your teeth you will find yourself continuously brushing.also the battery charge even on a new brush does not last as long as they claim.In conclusion I feel slightly cheated as it is surely the brush head that cleans the teeth so a cheaper model would be just as good and to add insult to injury the day after I received and unpacked my 6000 Amazon reduced the price.",3
4369,"I bought this toothbrush 5 months ago and everything has been fine, it's a toothbrush at the end of the day. Recently I will fully charge the toothbrush as usual and when it gets to the second bar it will die, this is very frustrating as I'm having to charge it pretty much every other day. I've spent about 10 minutes trying to find out how to get a replacement as I'm not happy this toothbrush has only lasted 5 months considering my other Oral B toothbrush lasted 2 years and was still going before I bought this one. Does anybody know how I can get in touch about getting a replacement? You'd think it would be simple but I can't even see a message the buyer option. Thanks for your help.",3
4370,"I bought this with high anticipation having read the reviews on Amazon . This is a very slow , somewhat boring read . The author obviously had a short story and had to pad it out to make it into a novel . Quite honestly I was bored stiff halfway through . A dull pedestrian read indeed",3
4371,I brought 2 boxes of water wipes from Superdrugs and they were very good and watery and had no smell. But these water wipes are not very watery and has a slight smell to it.,3
4372,"i brought this for my daughters room,which had a lot of light comming in through the window.but i found ths i tiem didnt work for me",3
4373,"I can only give these 3/5 because they’re extremely expensive compared to other brands, and they’re very wasteful as you can never just get one out - they always come out in clumps of two or four wipes. If you don’t need four wipes then that makes them even more expensive.And when your baby reaches the wriggly stage, fighting with the packet with one hand trying just to get ANY wipes out while keeping baby hands and feet contained and avoid poo going everywhere is just a nightmare. I’ve been using them for twelve months now, and as good as they are (and let’s face it, they’re just wipes...) with yet another price hike I’m now looking for an alternative.",3
4374,"I can see why they supply two.  The first one had a bubble in it and when lifting to remove this, the glass cracked.  It was my first such type of screen protector so I guess I should have been more careful.  I was on the second fitting which went well and I am pleased with the result.",3
4375,I can't say that I love this product as I found it very difficult to put on. I actually found it harder to put on that the clearskin style screen protector. I already have a bubble in it and have bought another screen protector as the first one of these snapped as well. It's fine but not the greatest by any means.,3
4376,I chose this rating as sometimes the blade does not always cut through the paper but do need a fair bit of pressure to get a clean cut.Delivery on time,3
4377,"I couldn't get it to stick to my window, so I gave up. However when I hooked it over the curtain rail and turned the lights off it was pitch black (and I live in London), so I can at least tell you it really is a blackout blind.",3
4378,"I did not consider this book to be ""Gripping""Stayed with it till the end waiting for the shocking twist!",3
4379,I didn't see the twist coming but that might be because it is a bit far fetched; I don't think real people would do that,3
4380,I do like the toothbrush but find it looses it's charge very quickly and then takes ages (at least a day) to recharge. I'm assuming it's the Bluetooth that saps the power. When I went to buy the product I was actually buying an older version (without the Bluetooth) but Amazon told me there was newer version so automatically chose that. Big mistake!,3
4381,"I enjoyed this book but like the title says, I didn't love it. It left me a bit cold but not in a good way, like you get with some books of this particular style.I felt the characters on the fringes needed a little development. This would have added to the conflicted dichotomy which underpins the story. In many ways I can see why they weren't. However, for me, I think a deeper sense of the wider implications could have given a little more depth and played more with the emotions generated by the themes running through.I found myself skipping through it, the flicking back and forth between characters got me more irritated than anything else. Again, personal preference.All in all a good book. The legal parts were interesting and an underlying frustration about an emotive topic(s) seemed quite strong.",3
4382,"I enjoyed this book, especially the court room drama scenes. There was plenty of tension throughout the book. I found all of the eclipse obsession a little dull and for a couple who were wanting to get on in life it seemed a huge extravagance financially. The tension between the trio of main characters was well written and had me gripped. I did not suss out how the book would conclude - it was a surprise to me.",3
4383,I feel slightly mean giving this book three stars and I can't quite put my finger on the reason why it just falls short of four stars. I think for me to give a four or five star rating it has to be a pageturner and it quite simply was not. I could easily go a day of two without picking it up and I found it quite slow going to begin with too.Having said that it IS a good story and worth a read. I could definitely see it as a four part drama on television at some point. It might even be BETTER on screen dare I say!,3
4384,I feel the quality of these wipes have decreased. They are expensive and I expect good quality when paying this sort of money. Unfortunately I don't have much choice as not a lot agrees with my little one's skin!,3
4385,"I find changing the brush is fine but having difficulty synchronising it with symbol on the device. All these brush heads but can't switch between the features, eg daily clean to deep clean.",3
4386,I find I had to wet the cups to get them to stick to windows I have new windows to kept falling down,3
4387,I found the story a bit unbelievable. There was too much bad language. All of it was a bit predictable..,3
4388,I found the story tedious and wanted it to get to the point.  Perhaps I did not have the patience or the correct frame of mind to read it.,3
4389,I found this book hard going.  It jumps between two dates and two main characters.,3
4390,I found this book hard to get into and understand. Not as good as the other books I have downloaded and read,3
4391,I found this book painfully slow to get going and there is far too much detail about solar eclipses. It takes up far too much of the book and it slowed the story down.I ended up skipping pages which is something I don't normally do but it got that boring I couldn't help it.I did get better towards the end and it was a surprise as to what really happened but it's a shame the back story was so mind numbingly boring.Perhaps it just wasn't fast paced enough for me.,3
4392,"I gave this item 3 stars because it keeps falling down!! Needs more stickers and or larger ones.Once it is secure it really does black out the light. Pity about the securing procedure.Arrived on time, nice folding bag.",3
4393,I got an european plug?,3
4394,"I got into this book early on. The few characters were easy to remember and get to know, or so you think. The twist at the end was unexpected and very well thought through. I certainly didn't expect it. I would recommend this book to my book club and anyone who likes a fast, easy read.",3
4395,I got this blind as our 2 year old is currently getting up any time between 4-5am at the moment... it is great! It really blocks out the light in his room. I love that it's portable and comes neatly folded in it's own little bag. I also like the stars on it! The only problem is a couple of mornings now (we've been using it for about 3 weeks) I've gone into his room and it's been on the floor. It's come unstuck and fallen down in the night. It's also come unstuck a few times when I've been putting him to bed too. I'm wondering if I'm sticking it up wrong!? Either way. It's great - but I hope it doesn't continue to get worse as that would be a shame.,3
4396,I got this screen cover for my 6s but it doesn't quite cover the whole screen. The seal of it ended up loosening after only 2 weeks. I have yet to put the 2nd cover on but I will give it a try and hopefully it will last longer.,3
4397,I had a Phililips rotary head shaver previously and found it very good till I left it on a train. In comparison this is not as good and I find it takes about 10 minutes of repeated shaving to get anywhere near the finish of the previous model: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004XIBA7W.This Braun wsa £20 cheaper but the saving is not worth it considering I am using it every day.,3
4398,"I had an older version of this toothbrush that died (why oh why can't you have the batteries replaced in these toothbrushes? it seems like a complete waste when that's all that fails on them).  I found that the more expensive version you buy the better the battery life.  So when I replaced my old toothbrush I downgraded slightly and ended up with one that beeped at you when your 30 seconds were up.  This one doesn't as you've got the countdown timer to go with it.The new feature seems to be the addition of bluetooth connection which is a bit odd.  I mean who wants to take their smartphone into the bathroom with them? I sort of get why it might be useful if you're not at home and want the countdown timer, or if you've got children and you're trying to teach them about the importance of brushing correctly and often.  For grown adults the only thing it does is drain the battery with the bluetooth connection.Still, it's a really good toothbrush and certainly gets to places cleaning that you need it to.",3

4401,I had to use 3 of the protectors before I could get one to lay down without bubbles,3
4402,"I hate shaving.  It was an immense relief many years ago when my wife bought me my first electric razor as a present as this greatly reduced the time and fuss of wet shaving.  That first razor was a Philips rotary shaver and by-and-large I've stayed with that brand ever since, although I'm aware that Braun have a good reputation and also have their adherents.  I was very interested to try this razor which I assumed for this very high price would be state-of-the-art in terms of both close shaving and construction.  However, when I first held it it seemed very 'plasticy'  (although I guess most razors do nowadays),  it did feel quite solid and looked OK with its mixture of shiny black plastic and rubber, with electric blue trim.  The head contains four 'specialised cutting elements' and pivots forwards and backwards or can be locked in one of 5 positions.  Unfortunately I was disappointed with my first dry shave - which wasn't at all close, leaving whiskers visible as well as not feeling smooth - not as good as my old Philips shaver and no where near as close as a wet shave.  Maybe I just need to adapt to the action of the Braun as opposed to the rotary action of the Philips.  It also has a pop-up facial hair trimmer which I found OK but not as good as the trimmers on Philips shavers - but again that's what I'm used to.This razor can also be used wet and also with foam (although it has to be cleaned after each foam usage), it can also be used in the bath and can be cleaned by running under the tap.Charging the razor takes a hour and the battery then lasts for 50 minutes, you can also do a quick charge in 5 minutes.  The razor comes with the charging cord (with two-pin plug), a handy zipped soft carrying case and a small bottle of lubricant for the foils (for use if you regularly clean under water).  The instruction booklet also covers the other six models in the Series 9 range, so many of the instructions (particularly concerning the 'Clean and charge station') don't apply to this model which is a bit annoying (although I notice that this razor does have ""Shaver-to-station contacts""?!?)",3
4403,"I have a growing collection of electric shavers with this Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3010s the latest one to arrive. I prefer using foil shavers and with this using pressure sensitive shaving elements, it seemed like a good choice for my sensitive skin.Performance wise, it's reasonable, but not brilliant. I've used this for dry and wet shaving usually using Tabac shaving soap. Generally, the shave isn't particularly close and I do find it misses hairs despite going over the same spot continuously. It is comfortable though and doesn't irritate my skin, which is goodOverall, It's an average shaver and I would personally recommend looking at the more expensive Braun shavers (which I prefer over Remington and Philips). My Series 9 is certainly one of the best I've used, but also one of the most expensive.",3
4404,"I have a heavy beard and I shave every other day.  The Braun Series 3 isn't quite up to the job but for a foil shaver it certainly would remove a five o'clock shadow.  It's a very versatile shaver at a good price, so if you shave every day and your stubble not too harsh, this would represent very good value.",3
4405,"I have a normal Fire HD 8 but the issues with the kids profile are the same.Just to echo what other people have said: you cannot share Prime videos on the kids profile, only content that has been purchased. And even then it shows the entire series so if you're offline you have to guess which episodes are downloaded. You can't even share the full Amazon Video app on a kids profile as a workaround.This is a massive regression from the original Fire HD which worked perfectly for Prime video, and also significantly worse than the kids iPlayer and Netflix apps, which both work seamlessly. I'm now in the ridiculous position of using my new Fire solely for non-Amazon content. What are Amazon thinking?All that said, it otherwise works ok and is very cheap for a tablet so I can't really rate lower than 3*.",3

However, I have also noticed that when i bought the box - i.e. in bulk - the wipes are not as moist and when i pull one, 15 come off.The product itself does not deserve 1 star but the packaging does. But as I love the product, i have to rate it 3.",3
4408,"I have been using these for over a year since our first child was born, very good product, highly recommended.However, on the last couple of orders, not sure if it's me, but each pack appears to have shrunk? The tissues are noticeably much narrower than before. I guess they are finding ways to reduce costs to cover the tv adverts recently.",3
4409,"I have been with sonicare for years but alas my brush failed. As this was on offer and considerable cheaper than the equivalent sonicare (I tried a Colgate one but the lasted 10 days). I gave this ago.  It is considerably bigger than the sonicare and you have to charge it every  5/6 days! Come on oral b I managed 2 weeks out of a sonic one And this is alot bigger, I bet you could get a better battery in that space?I found the cross cut brush head brutal and I ended up with bleeding gums, following a trip to the dentist (oral b advocate) she recommended A different head and setting, this works a treat now.My mouth feels as clean as it did with my sonicare, the timer widget is a good reminder but the phone app has hardly been used, I'll try this when I go way with work.The build quality seems good, but the charger could do with a longer cable. The travel case is good, but come on oral b, your brush is massive and the the case could be made alot smaller, you would struggle to get this in your hand luggage on a certain Irish budget airline!!",3
4410,"I have bought this product, because I have had a money off voucher and though to give it a go. I think they feel a bit rough and I don't really think they are value for money. There is nothing extraordinary about them, other than that there is (suppose) nothing else added. Then again you can also use reusable wipes, which do the same job and are by far cheaper and buy ordinary supermarket wipes for convenience when you are on the go. I agree that some baby's skin is more sensitive than others and they can't use any product on them. Since my child is perfectly fine with any other (cheaper) wipes, I will not buy these, unless I'll have money off vouchers again.",3
4411,"I have had this toothbrush now for a few months. As a toothbrush this gives good results and I like the option of different heads, however, the battery life is very poor. Brushing twice a day for two min's each time it only last four-five days before needing to be recharged; so no good to take away from home unless you also take the charger. As a comparison my previous Phillips Sonicare would last at least 15-16 days before needing a recharge. The Sonicare also gave you some warning that it would need a recharge soon by displaying an orange light. This Oral-B just stops without warning, leaving you to brush manually which rather defeats the object of having a powered toothbrush. I appreciate the mechanical action of the OralB saps battery power compared to the sonic action of the Phillips but I was expecting battery life of at least 10 days. So in summary if you travel a lot and don't want to also take the bulky charger, don't bother with this one, however, if you just intend to use it at home and it can sit next to a charging point you will probably find it does all you need it to do.",3
4412,I have just purchased the series 3 340. This is not a mains /charged shaver. If the power is switched on whist cord is attached it is disconnected. this is very annoying!! I found that with my previous braun 340 it was slightly more powered when being used with the mains lead attached.Braun why have you changed this?. Is it a safety feature because of some EU regulation?,3
4413,"I have mixed feelings about this shaver and here they are, nearly laid out in pros and cons for you...Pros:• Looks great - lovely colour scheme. Very manly• Feels great - feels well-built, sturdy and robust. Very manlyCons:• Not the greatest shave - it worked fine but, I don't know... Can't quite put my finger on it. I've had better shavers• Hated the fact you had to take the shaver head of to use the other attachments. This made a little tidy up of the sideburns a right hassle. Other shavers I had had a little pop up blade which was quicker and easier to use.• Huge plug! Massive! Never seen anything like it! Stuck out about three inches from the wall• Came with a bag which was useless. Couldn't fit the shaver in or all of its components. Major disappointment.• Really, really need a case to keep the shaver heads in.Overall, this is an OK shaver but things about it will annoy you. Shame, as with the addition of a few other bits and bobs it could have been really good.",3
4414,I have not found many screen protectors that don't give my iPhone 6s a bubble section around the outside of the screen and this is no exception. It's a good wonder product and not enough of a problem for me to return it but because of the curved screen edges this seems slightly to big and doesn't stick fully to the flat part.,3
4415,I have not used the timer once. The toothbrush notifies you ever 30 seconds and when 2 mins are up. Nor the bluetooth. The actual tooth-brushing is great though!,3
4416,"I have returned this time since buying it.Reason for return: It is basically for someone who shaves every 3-5 days or every week atleast.I shave every 3 weeks so for me it is useless as I had to first trim my beard with my trimmer and then use this to shave which was as you can see totally nuisance for me.But from a strictly shaving point of view, it shaves really nice and close. It is a great starter shaver for any person starting to shave or for someone who is not comfortable using blades on their face. But remember, it can still leave you with cuts deep enough for slight blood to ooze out of your skin as it certainly left me with some cuts but again I am not really shaver kind of guy so this was certainly going to happen to me.",3
4417,I have subscribed to these wipes and had no complaints until the last two deliveries.Firstly the wipes do not have an opening under the plastic flap to take wipes out like it used to. This is very inconvenient and we have to use scissor for every new pack. Secondly a couple of packs of wipes were damaged so the wipes had dried out. This is from the cardboard box with 12 packs.,3
4418,"I have to say immediately that the shaver I removed from the box was not the shaver I was expecting. In fact it's not the shaver that's advertised. Whether on YouTube reviews or on the Braun website, on the illustrations here on Amazon or even on the box it came in, the main body of the 9095cc clearly has a satin or anodised stainless steel type finish with discreet chrome trim. What I've got here in front of me is one big mass of shiny plastic chrome.  Before I received it I'd seen a recent reviewer here say his was chrome and I thought well if that's so, it could look quite good. I was wrong. It doesn't. Smart, understated and expensive looking it is not. Think garish. Think fairground.On further inspection, more disappointment was to come. I am replacing a 5030 which I like a lot in all but the actual shave and I was pleased to see that the series 5 chassis was being used for series 9. But unfortunately they've fiddled with it to its detriment. The rubber rear wrap-around wraps right around the sides of the 5030 and is of a softer more grippy 'rubber' than that used on this one where it's hard and smoother and only covers the rear of the shaver, so I find half my grip is on hard rubber and half on shiny plastic. I now realise how firm and secure the 5030 feels in my hand, like I'm holding a rubber shaver. I was wrongly expecting the same here, but Braun have taken that away from me. Then there's the large head-locking slide switch. On the 5030 this is made of the same rubberised material as that of it's main body to which my thumb immediately grips and is dead easy to slide. On the 9095 this is now a shiny 'metal' switch with tiny shallow hard pips which my (dry) thumb keeps slipping off and which I have to press really hard on (with a slightly arthritic thumb) in order to make it slide.  I've not got the shaver near anything wet yet and I can only say I don't relish the thought of trying to keep hold of it in the shower if it's this slippery when dry.And yes, the trimmer really is a joke, no getting away from it, 5030 or 9095. As I said in a comment to another review, I keep an old Braun Flex Integra shaver handy which has a large straight cutter and does the back of my neck a treat now and again. The trimmer on this one? A tiny awkwardly placed convex thingy that's nowhere near up to the intended job. Feeble and next to useless I'd say.The shave isn't at all bad though. At least as good as series 7. But that brings me to I think my last gripe. Being of advanced years I always finish off by running the shaver over my ears. So I was surprised to hear myself suddenly emit a distinct Ow! It turned out that that little bump in front of your ear (the tragus) had been touched by the middle cutters of the shaver. And they felt very warm to my fingers. So I did a test. From cold, I switched both the 9095 and the 5030 on together and let them just run for 2 minutes, and yes, you guessed it. The single middle cutter of the 5030 was slightly warm and it's two main cutters were still cool. But where the two main cutters of the 9095 were also cool, the two middle ones were hot. I mean hot. Not very warm. Hot. OK then, very very warm at least. Without even having been pressed against my cheek for 2 or 3 minutes. OK, hot enough for me now to be a bit wary every time I get it near those little bumpy bits in front of my ears in case it makes me yelp.Oh and another, albeit tiny, thing. The 'Numerical Display' which is proudly showing the number 9 in all the pictures only becomes numerical, as far as I can make out from the instructions, just before it completely runs out of power. Up until then, it seems, the display is the same as all the others in the series, ie. a simple five bar countdown.  Neither here nor there of course in the great scheme of things, and hardly important. But when it says on this page that the 9095's display is 'Numerical LED' against that of the 9040's which is '5 LED', I expected to turn it on and see a number. I saw 5 bars. Seems if I keep it charged I will never see a number.I haven't taken the cleaning station out of the box yet so I can't comment on that. If and when I do and then need to replace the fluid cartridge I intend to refill it with my own concoction of isopropyl and lemon essence drops which I've always used to clean and lubricate my shavers. One of my wife's empty screw top plastic face cream tubs, filled to about an inch and a quick swish round of the head in this does exactly the same job nicely and it dries within minutes too.So there we are. Not a particularly happy bunny. I know I was taking a risk forking out this much just for a shaver, and now I'm hearing voices from the distant past saying well serves you right, you should have known better. I'm also aware that most of this is mere nit-picking to a certain extent, and when added up warrants the deduction of only one star because, as I said, the shave is ok. But I expected more than an ok shave. For this sort of money I wanted a work of art. If it was only a good shave I was after I'd have bought myself a packet of razor blades.[Edit: A few days later I've found that all my waffle about whether it gets very warm or hot was well warranted. This shaver gets uncomfortably hot a minute or so into the shave. I am very conscious of the heat emanating off the central cutters as I'm shaving, so much so that I can feel my face burning when I finish the shave. This surprises me as I've never experienced this with any of my previous Brauns. For this I'm deducting another star. I'm tempted to remove 2.]",3
4419,"I have tried a number of times in the past to ""Go electric"" with shavers and the latest discount price on this one as well as positive reviews made me think this might be the right time to try again.I'm not sure how fine the other reviewers facial hair is but I using it on anything more than a 5 o'clock shadow is quite painful and doesnt leave you with a clean shave. If you attempt to use it on a three day growth like advertised and go against the grain of your beard then beware! I find after using for some time I always have to go over again with a standard razor to pick up any stray, missed hairs.For an electric shaver it is moderately priced and as good as any other I have used including more expensive ones but I would say if you like a proper shave then wet shaving is the only way to go.",3
4420,"I have tried this racer for a few weeks to try and get used to it. I have been using a Gillette battery driven blade razer.First impressions were very good. Well made, great weight, feels good in the hand. The problem I have is that it does not give a close shave. It also takes me far longer to shave with this razer than a blade razer. I need to go over the same areas many times. Shaving around the jawbone area certainly takes a lot longer and, again, does not seem to shave closely. I've tried it with the head in static and flexible mode and no real discernible difference. I also tried it in dry, wet, shaving gel and no gel - I still get a faster and closer shave with a £20 blade.Some may like this type of razer but it's not for me. 3 stars as its ok but that's it.",3
4421,I have two of these as they are much needed when travelling with little ones. Unfortunately the suction cups are useless and do no stay on the glass and many have come off by morning. I have found that sticking little velcro tabs on the window frame itself works the best when stuck to the velcro tabs on the blind.,3
4422,I have used several types of electric shaver and they all have some problems. With this one I find that although the trimmer is pulled back when shaving under the chin if any difficulty moving head back it can scratch the skin opposite the chin.,3
4423,"I hoped it would be better, it's ok but not great. The Velcro is awkward, the suckers don't stick very well to the window so the blind comes half off soon after putting it up, but it's a bit better than nothing.",3
4424,I just found the instructions a bit confusing and you’ve got to be very precise and quick applying the protective shield because once it’s on it’s on.,3
4425,I keep having to soften the suction cups to make it hold its place.Can be a pain to affix. That said when it works it's great,3
4426,I know they are water wipes...but far too watery. Before I use them I have to wring it first inside dirty nappy before using them. I continue to use them because they are so natural.,3
4427,"I like the wipes but the packaging is very bad. The lip doesn't close after using a couple of times. The wipes don't dry out even out the problem. Another problem+ I'm always struggling to take one and not a dozen, they're so wet that they stick on each other. A new pack us heavy compered to others. A merited five if those can be fixed. Regards",3
4428,"I liked the premise of this book and was excited to read it. Unfortunately I was just an okay read for me rather than what I had expected.The story was quite a slow starter if I'm being honest. It was told in two different timelines, one in the present day and the other going over the years since Laura and Kit met. I found myself wanting to skim read a lot of their past life story so that I could get to the more exciting parts of the book. I made my own mind up about what the author was hinting was the issue from the past that they were dealing with. When it was finally revealed I was shocked at the extent of the lies which had been told.The final part of the book, from the actual reveal, was the best part of the story in my opinion. I forgave the fact that the story had taken a while to get to that point, and found myself totally drawn in to the aftermath.This was an okay read which picked up pace a little too late for me to give it a higher rating. Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing a copy.",3
4429,I liked the style of how this was written but wasn't particularly gripped by the story. It got better and then ended weirdly. Better books of this genre out there.,3
4430,"I love the concept of a portable black out curtain as I cannot sleep with any light. However, the suction cups don't let the curtain sit flush to the window, so light slips in around the edges and if there are any irregularities in window sizing e.g. a fixed window in the middle of 2 opening ones, it is very hard to adjust. The velcro tabs to adjust height and length, although a good idea, don't work for all shapes and sizes and the folds also allow the light in. The suction cups can be somewhat temperamental, I found it best to only slightly moisten them, more towards the centre, but ultimately removed them due to the aforementioned issue.",3
4431,"I love the idea of this blackout blind - it was really helpful when I moved into a rental flat with really rubbish curtains.It's good quality material and you get a lot of blind for your money, but the suction pads are a bit rubbish and kept falling down. I'd have to restick them every morning and it got a bit annoying - I can see it being good for travelling  with young kids though. It comes in a handy bag and packs down really small.",3
4432,I love these and I love that they don’t contain a million chemicals or ingredients. My baby does really well with them. It gets 3 stars because they aren’t eco friendly,3
4433,i love waterwipes however one pack was open and the whole box was wet and manky.also the new packaging is not the best quality. we have noticed that the foil is excessively tearing after only a few days of using the product.,3
4434,I loved these wipes when my baby was a newborn and so wanted to continue to use them however for some crazy reason they've gone from £24 to £40 - I mean seriously what on earth is going on?!After reading recent reviews it seems that the quality that I liked has also changed as well so won't bother buying again which is a shame as actually did like them but not enough for the new price tag (or quality)!,3
4435,I loved this product prior to change of packaging as i feel the quality has changed. The wipes are not as moist as used to be feel bit dry and seem to be much thiner.,3
4436,"I nearly gave up as it was too slow for me to start. I did, however, get into it and enjoy it from about a third of the way through. It had some clever twists a turns which were good but the final twist was just one too many and seemed unrealistic.That said I read this for a book club and many others thought the book was great so definitely worth a try",3
4437,I ordered it for my iphone 6s and Im dissappointed as it doesn't fit the full size of the screen. There is an area around the entire edge of the phone that is not covered.,3
4438,I ordered this for my younger sibling. The actual product works and does protect the screen from drops and scratches. Easy to place on phone and easy to remove without damaging screen. One however came smashed.,3
4439,"I purchased these wipes as a bulk buy before my little one arrived in October this year. I love the fact that they are simply water and fruit extract.  For a new born i thought these would be perfect and on the whole they aren't awful. However they are quite a bit more expensive then other brands even as a bulk buy, they are difficult to get out of the packet and because the wipes are full of water after every change I had to use an additional cloth to dry her bum before putting the nappy on. As much as I tried to dry her bum she did suffer with soreness from time to time. I have since changed to a different brand and her bum no longer needs a dry and hasn't been sore.  Unless your baby has developed an allergy from wipes or was born prematurely (so their skin is even more sensitive) then I'm not sure of the benefits of these wipes.",3
4440,"I purchased this in March 2016, it was brilliant at first and gave a really close shave.Unfortunately by August 2016, it became blunt and hardly touches my bristles at allI shave on average once or twice a week, so not a heavy user.I will contact Braun to check warranty details.",3
4441,"I purchased this shaver at £150 on a black Friday deal last year, it works well on my cheeks but honestly for the price I expected more. Because of this I genuinely wouldn't recommend buying this at the retail price which is very overpriced.This was my first electronic shaver I've always wet shaved. I can say that it is decent if you need to run to university or work quickly, but of you want that baby soft shave you'll have to spend the ten extra minutes with a wet shave blade.",3
4442,"I purchased two of these for children's rooms, each of different size,to fit behind blinds that had light seeping in around the edges waking them up too early. The suckers frequently fall off, and although the idea of the Velcro tabs to resize to smaller windows is good, in practice it means sagging and bunching because the Velcro is only around the edges so the middle sags and doesn't hold a fold so to speak, and so not a tidy fit to the window- this is particularly bad on the smaller window, and makes fitting them behind a blind an issue.",3
4443,"I purchased two types of tempered glass protectors, this is the acceptable one.It does what it says but as  the screen protector is flat and the screen has a bit of a curve, the edges just don't stick. So far that's the only issue.The customer service is excellent, thanks for that guys.",3
4444,I quite enjoyed this book but did struggle with it slighty. I felt it drifted too far away from what I believed the main storyline to be about and got quite far fetched and it seemed that everybody had secrets. It didn't make me feel that I just wanted to pick up this book whenever I had a spare opportunity to read and I struggled a bit to get through it.,3
4445,"I quite enjoyed this book. For me the likelihood of the two main female characters becoming friends was unlikely, who lets in a perfect stranger to their home. I felt that some of the characters were a little one dimensional and needed more background. The story itself was well thought out and I didn't see the twist at the end coming at all. Maybe a little unbelievable in places but then life can be too.",3
4446,"I quite enjoyed this book. I'd never read a Times Best Seller and thought it would be awesome, but found it very good. It was an interesting analysis of a subject where generally there are no witnesses to the alleged crime, hence the He said She said element, but on this occasion, there were witnesses which added a fascinating dimension to the story - especially as the witnesses told their own He said She said tales in parallel. I loved the short chapters and plots told in flashback are often difficult to follow but the author simply provided the timescale at the start of each chapter and this meant I could pick up the thread easily having put the book down for a couple of days or more. However, the pace of the book was pretty constantly in 3rd gear, I felt, and I would have welcomed some humour and wit. It could have been shortened, I feel, and I almost gave up on it as I felt the same territory was being covered without the story moving forward. The author asked for a leap of faith for at least a third of the book in that the main characters were portrayed as being in mortal danger and it's difficult for the reader to be afraid of something that hasn't been represented as really scary. I was left a bit confused that someone was looking over their shoulder, afraid of being followed and armed against  ever-present danger and I can't really explain why they behaved that way. However, the plot twist was shocking and unexpected and, because of this the story soared towards the end.",3
4447,"I read this to the end, even though I wasn't really enjoying it.  To me, it is a second rate version of The girl on a Train.  I disliked the main characters to such an extent, that I didn't really care about then.  So, sorry, I can't rate it any higher.",3
4448,I really didn't like it up until they where in the court.  I struggled and was not going to continue to read it on a few occasions.  However I persevered and grew to love the second part.,3
4449,"I really enjoyed this book and found the story engaging and interesting. Finding out about each character was fun, BUT the story took a downward and unexpected spiral into farce when Kit arrived home to the scene in his kitchen. After that chapter the story was unrealistic and not at all enjoyable. The ending just stupid. I gave it 3 stars, but maybe only deserved 2.",3
4450,I really struggled with this book until I was about 2 thirds through it and then it seemed to flow. I'm not sure why I struggled as it is normally the type of book I would enjoy. Maybe because I knew there was a twist I just wanted it to get to the point!,3
4451,"I really was ready to call it a day but cause reviews had said stick with it I did, but, when the story did start to unfurl I found it all rather complicated and disjointed to keep up.  I did finish it though but was really disappointed with the ending.",3
4452,"I received the item very quickly, however when it came to using it, I was left disappointed. The item doesn't stick to the window at all - it keeps falling down meaning I have to re-stick it time and time again.It would have been great, if it worked.I did however receive the item very quickly, and customers service is outstanding.",3
4453,"I recommend buying the Braun series 9 without the cleaning machine, it's rarely used and collects dust. Also the liquid solutions are expensive",3
4454,"I recommended this product to so many people, and have used WaterWipes since our baby was born 15 months ago. The last batch we bought (bulk pack of 60 wipes, not 72) has degraded in quality. The wipes seem 'tougher', drier and somehow seem to tangle up much more when trying to pull them out. No longer worth the money, and they are relatively expensive compared to picking up a basketful in a supermarket. (And now our baby is a 15 month old, I feel slightly less protective of her bum!)",3
4455,"I regularly have to replace these electronic toothbrushes after less than 2 years worth of use.They are great to use, but seems like a VERY expensive way to brush your teeth..",3

4457,"I say; at times,  an interesting read, I lived and experienced the eclipse in Cornwall so that was quite cool. Otherwise, not bad.",3
4458,"I scraped it within 24 hours of it being on the phone, I put the phone in alongside a key in my pocket and it scraped the screen protector.  I suppose it was better than being on the phone screen itself!",3
4459,"I started off really keen on this book, but unfortunately I've found it a bit of a chore. Got half way through it and decided to start something else. I may try going back to it at a later date, incase it picks up again.",3
4460,"I started with warm water and cotton wool, and then moved on to water wipes - it just seemed the most pure way to wipe. However now that we're onto solid food and the poos are much bigger, I have to say I've moved on to normal baby wipes because I need to use 4-5 per job and water wipes seem expensive. The first 3 wipes are just wiping a load of poo and chucking straight away, there's hardly any contact with skin. But I still use water wipes to wipe face and hands after eating. Two things irritate me about them. It's really hard to get them out of the pack - each wipe does not tease out the next one. So I either pull a load out accidentally and then have to stuff them back in, or have to prepare a bunch in advance, but without knowing for sure the contents of the nappy. Also, water seeps downwards under gravity so the last 1cm of wipes are really sodden and dripping. I actually have to taken them all out and squeeze the excess so they're more similar to the wetness of baby wipes.",3
4461,I thought a very slow start. Nearly gave up on it. I bought the book because of the raving reveiws so it was a bit disappointing. I was nearly half way through before it really started to pick up. Never saw the twists coming.,3
4462,I thought it was rather predictable. Disappointed that I worked out more or less what had happened near the start... and I rarely get it right! I ended up not liking a single one of the characters.,3
4463,"I thought it would cover the screen a little more because I have friends who have the same phone as myself and their screen protectors cover more of their phone. Other than that, the quality of the protector is amazing and I would definitely recommend",3
4464,"I thought that I would really like this book, but I struggled with it almost from the beginning. I found the introduction quite slow, and that there was too much detail about Laura and Kit’s passion for eclipses. I didn’t find a single character likeable, and throughout the first half of the book I had to resist the temptation to abandon it for something better. However, by this time the pace had picked up and the plot became quite exciting. I loved the unexpected revelations and the suspense of ‘what happens next’ but unfortunately, towards the end, it all turned rather manic and chaotic.I can’t pinpoint just why this didn’t engage me, because the writing isn’t bad. The book is plot driven – perhaps at the expense of character development – but it couldn’t sustain my interest.",3
4465,"I use this for cropping photos that i use in my scrapbook, i wouldnt say this is brilliant as it doesnt seem to cut through photos very well. They also dont seem to cut straight even though they are lined up correctly. I wouldn't purchase again.",3
4466,"I usually alternate unimaginatively between Braun and Philips when buying a new shaver and it was Braun's turn this time although the decision was largely influenced by the good reviews I saw at the time.  I've given it more than a few weeks to adjust but have never experienced a satisfactory shave, no matter how many different angles I try.  It's alright, but I feel I'll be looking for something else in the near future.",3

It only has velcro tabs on the edges, so the middle sags and looks horrible.Some of the suction cups will just not stick and keep getting loose.It is so annoying to put on that I just left mine on the windows, which is fine if I'm not home, but annoying if I am, as I don't have natural light during the day.It's okay if you need something portable, otherwise go with one of the regular blinds.",3
4468,"I want to love these as they are so pure and perfect for little people, BUT they are SO annoying to get out of the packet (unlike something like Pampers), very hard to actually get out and often you end up with a clump. Also by the time you get through the packet, the ones at the bottom are very saturated - you actually have to squeeze them out before using",3
4469,"I wanted to like this book because Erin Kelly is a great writer. However, I found it frustrating because the facts were held back for too long. In the early chapters Laura and Kit are hiding from someone who means them harm, but we don’t know why or whether it’s a real fear or imagined. Because you don’t know what the problem is, you don’t have a reason to care about them, and they seem quite dull. When the reason is revealed it makes sense, but it was held back for far too long. Towards the end there’s a cracking twist, which opened the whole story out and made sense of it all. Again, it would have been a more satisfying read to have revealed it earlier. It’s a clever moral story that rang true and came good in the final chapters, but it could have been pacier.",3
4470,"I wanted to love this shaver.  It looks like a great machine, but I have to say that in terms of effectiveness, it's no hetter than the much cheaper machine it replaced.  Maybe over time I'll appreciate it for its greater longevity?  Does the job, but nothing special.",3
4471,I wanted to more positive about this excellent toothbrush but unfortunately the SmartGuide has stopped working already!,3
4472,I was a little disappointed with this book. It started really slowly and failed to keep my interest. I almost gave up but I don’t like doing this so persevered with it. It got a little better in the second part of the book. Saying that I did finish it and at the end of the book there was a good twist but my main feeling was one of relief to be able to go onto something else which was a bit more exciting.,3

4474,"I was hoping for better but this provides nowhere near the same close shave as you would get with a razor. I have now come to use it for a ""top-up"" mid-week shave.It might also be my skin but strangely I find this to cause me more irritation than the razor. Maybe the sensitive skin version would have been better but I didn't think I would need that since I use a regular shaving gel and razor without any problems.Another thing is that it does not completely get all the hair just above the adam's apple when I shave. I end up having to use the built-in trimmer attachment for that.So if you're thinking of making the move from a razor to a shaver, then maybe you're better off sticking with the razor.",3
4475,"I was lucky enough to win an unfinished copy of this book on a Goodreads giveaway.The year is 1999, Kit and Laura are down in Cornwall at a festival held for eclipse chasers, this will be their first one together and the start of many more to come. Kit has all the future eclipses planned out, he has been doing this his whole life  and wants to share it with the woman he loves and future children. With it being cloudy the odds of a total eclipse is minimal, to try and get a better viewing angle the couple move out to the edges of the festival, but what they do witness changes their lives forever. Kit and Laura are embroiled in a rape case, Jamie Balcombe was witnessed attacking Beth Taylor – Will Laura’s testimony be enough for a conviction?He Said/She Said is told from alternating point of views from Kit and Laura. They are also told from past and present, so will get a chapter from Kit in 2015 and 1999 and the same from Laura. This allows the stories to be interwoven and tells what happened and how it has affected them now. This is another slow paced book that feeds you small amounts of information at a time and when you think you know what has happened it takes an unexpected turn.Laura in present day is an unreliable narrator, she suffers with anxiety and is extremely paranoid. We don’t find out for a long time how she has become this way all we do know that it’s related to ‘Beth’. In 1999, Laura has her whole life ahead of her, she has just met Kit and has this outgoing nature to her. As the story progresses you begin understand why she is so paranoid and why she is so anxious.Kit seemed like a super relaxed guy that takes everything in his stride, Laura is his soulmate and have been together for 15 years and will protect her to no end. At points he could be very meticulous and other points very sloppy regarding their change of identity. I must admit that Laura is the stronger character of the two and her POV was much more enjoyable.I felt this book especially the first half was very slow even when there were parts that really appealed to me. The story line was good not something I have read about before and I didn’t think it was predictable but when the twist happened it wasn’t anything majorly startling for me.My actual reaction was ‘oh’! but the second half was much better than the first and had more action to it.There is a trigger warning of Rape, so if this is something you are uncomfortable reading about then this might not be the book for you.I rated this book 3.5 out of 5 stars",3
4476,"I was really looked forward to this after seeing the good reviews.  However, for me I found that the story bounced around in time too much and I kept getting confused about the point in time I was in.  Probably due to the fact that with my hectic lifestyle I sometimes find I can’t get back to the book for a week but if I had been reading it front to back in a few days probably wouldn’t have that issue.Overall I thought it was a good story though and would certainly try another by the same author.",3
4477,"I was recommended this by friend, it is constantly falling down and still lets in quite a bit of light",3
4478,I was sent the wrong size screen protector.,3
4479,"I was surprised that this was a best selling book, to me it appeared a weak story and not believable",3
4480,"I was told in antenatal classes that only cotton wool and water was the only accepctable way to clean your baby or failing that (seriously, who's going to be fetching bowls of water at 4 am!)  to use these. They are very expensive and we didn't find them wet enough. Due to the way the pack opens you'd end up pulling out about 20 in one go and they dried up pretty quickly too.I found Pampers wipes to be perfectly fine for my baby and would recommend over Waterwipes.",3
4481,"I wasn't very impressed with the rotary cutter ,it didn't feel very solid to use,it will be ok for small uses",3
4482,"I Wavered between two and four stars. The storyline is told alternately by two of the main characters- Kit and Laura, from 2000 and 2015. Kit is an avid full eclipse follower, who travels the world to see these happenings and keeps photos, maps and memorabilia from his experiences. Laura, Kit's girlfriend, joins him on some of his excursions. At one event, Lizard Point in Cornwall, Kit and Laura witness a serious sexual assault and this is where the crux of the plot begins. There are two other main characters- Beth and Jamie; Beth being the victim and Jamie the alleged assailant.What follows is at times dramatic and at other times very slow; tediously so. Someone is/has told lies but which one of the four is the puzzle. There is a twist to the plot. Had this come sooner the book would have been better (for me). The eclipse business was really an aside, which didn't add much. The book is certainly worth reading and deserves at least 3 stars.",3
4483,"I wet shave but also supplement that by occasional use of my 20+ year old Braun when I need to get at tight corners otherwise difficult to reach using a razor. That old Braun was one of those rectangular shaped units with a curved single piece foil  but the battery was starting to fail and so quite by chance I stumbled upon a Black Friday deal on a new Braun that retailed at £105 but was now on offer for just £35. Well, I jumped at the chance to avail myself of such a fantastic deal. I needed to replace my ancient Braun with a new one and the price was perfect. In addition, I had imagined that by getting myself a model that usually retailed for over £100 that I would be making a substantial step up in the performance of this shaver over my old one.OK, so here's the verdict; yes, the new Braun is superbly made. It is clearly a quality product. Sturdy and solid, it really does feel premium with its multiple foil surfaces and weighty heft. However, I cannot honestly say that it delivers a better shave than my vintage Braun. In fact, I'd say that my old unit cut more hairs off in a single stroke judging by the sound made and feel of my face after each pass. The new model whirs away at high speed but feels as if it's not taking as much hair off on each stroke. Everything else about the new model is clearly superior to my old one apart from the actual shaving experience. Of course, this is largely a subjective thing but I certainly do feel as if less hair is being taken off each stroke on the highly expensive new shaver and so I'd have to conclude that it was not worth the original asking price and the price of £35 is actually a more realistic one. Shame really as the shaver is very well made. It just doesn't shave as well in my opinion.Also have to mention that using a £100+ shaver still doesn't hold a candle to wet shaving with something like a Mach 3 which I use. Again, perhaps a rather subjective view but one I think many men share. It just seems that no matter how much you spend on an electric shaver, you cannot get the experience of wet shaving.",3
4484,I will persevere but really can't get into this book.,3
4485,"I wished Amazon had kept Android bit more original like Samsung.Its good value product but my kid who got used to mobile usage dint enjoy interface very much.Its ok but unless u are a techie or used to amazon tabs, think further.Had delivery issues as well but very well sorted out by Amazon.",3
4486,I would get the next version down which is about 30 quid cheaper. Not worth paying more for an extra brushing setting and why does it need a bluetooth connection? takes ages to charge. Works well though and overall pleased with it but I should have bought the next version down and saved a bit of cash.,3
4487,I would love it more if I didn't have to charge it every 3 days!,3
4488,I wouldn't buy this again. Was ok to start with but soon began to rip the paper rather than cut it. It's a bit flimsy so when you press down it bends and doesn't always give a straight cut. My advice: pay more for a more solid version.,3
4489,I wouldnt say it is the best Ive dropped it 2 inches and a small crack appeared. It wasnt that easy to stick on as it doesnt cover the whole iphone it only covers literally the screen so i messed up the first installment but got it correct second time round. Nonetheless it is still clear so thumbs up for that. Although i was expecting much more from this i suggest people to find a cheaper alternative.,3
4490,i wouldnt say they were high quality but they add a nice bit of sparkle ...worth the money.,3
4491,I'd give 3.5 out of 5 for this. It's expensive for what it is and the suckers can drop off randomly.,3
4492,I'd give this product a higher rating if one of the two screens hadn't been unusable due to a fault (small chip). The one usable one was easy to apply and is very smooth with the touchscreen. No noticeable gap in the side with the case I use.,3
4493,"I'm a bit picky with shavers and always swapping between rotary Philishave and foil. This is a good shaver but I wish some inventive person, probably Philips with their patent, designed a switchable version. Having been a user of the Philishave for some time it's always interesting switching back to a foil shave and this one is very sophisticated including a self cleaning function. I'm used to the idea of the self cleaning but not yet convinced it's the real deal. The process clears and lubricates the mechanism by means of a fluid cartridge, an extra charge ongoing.Self cleaning is not quite what it appears as it's not the end of shaver cleaning, the user still needs to brush the blades clean from time to time, but it's a fun function to observe and you can only admire the workmanship that went into the design.On the whole I believe this does not quite achieve the close shave of a rotary, so for me close but ...hmm not quite there.",3
4494,I'm afraid I struggled and ended up skimming and back-tracking.  But the serious assault at the heart of the story was very sensitively handled.,3
4495,"I'm used to flexible, plastic covers.  This one is thin glass.  Easier to put on and no air bubbles and works better than expected, but most disappointingly, it doesn't cover the whole front of the phone, so there is an annoying gap of 2-4 mm between protector and edge of phone glass which doesn't feel nice when handling the phone.",3
4496,"I've always been a Phillips man so it was with trepidation I moved to Braun. Initial thoughts were that I'd made the right choice, but quality of shave has deteriorated after only a few weeks. Reserving my opinion at this point and will see how it goes.",3
4497,"I've always wanted a top of the range shaver, so requested this for Christmas. Nice bit of kit, although it's lighter than I'd given it credit for from the pics. Feels like it could do with a bit more weight.But onto the important thing; the shave. Honestly, it leaves a lot to be desired. It just will not cut every hair, and the neck is so awkward to do, leaving many hairs leftover. I'm actually really disappointed in the performance.If this is ""the best"" out there, I'll stick to cheaper manual blades.",3
4498,"I've applied screen protectors to many phones, tablets etc before now so was disappointed by the amount of effort required to apply this one. Failed miserably on first attempt and had to throw protector away. Managed to get second one in place.  Uncertain as to whether it was just bad luck or a poor product - cut, quality etc. This is the second JETec product I've had a problem with?",3
4499,"I've been putting off getting myself a new electric razor for months. My old razors were becoming so blunt they were yanking instead of cutting. Then I cut my lip and finally decided it was time to get a new one.Wahl no longer seem to make their range of good basic razors at a reasonable price (£25 - £40). Most electric razors these days are silly money (£60++). Best I could find was this ""Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3040s Rechargeable"" for £40.Upsides:1. Its a good comfortable razor. (There are cheaper ones but they don't have a trimmer or they get very bad reviews.)2. Reasonable price for a decent razor these days.Downsides:1. The power cord is not coiled like an old style phone and feels cheap. And you must use a Braun power cord because it steps down the volts - luckily I have a nicer cord from my previous Braun.2. The cutting head is a complex cassette unit. Looks fragile. Presumably pricey to replace. Best not drop it.3. It doesn't run while plugged in as my old rechargeable Braun did. I think Braun will argue this is a safety feature for a razor that can be used wet - it also means the razor will be completely useless when the battery gives up (just a coincidence I'm sure. Ha.).4. Battery is not accessible and not replaceable. Time the EU did something about that. Oh I forgot we are out on our necks in the UK anyway.",3
4500,"I've been using this for a month now, and have to say I am only reasonably satisfied. I will continue to use it but I regret buying a spare foil+cutter as I will probably upgrade to a higher quality model later this year. I may be a little unfair as I had been using one of Braun's top of the range models for 10 years previously - the 7000 series synchro pro. I REALLY miss the swivel head on this cheaper series 3 shaver - it is quite awkward to get used to a fixed head shaver again. However I do like how easy it is to clean, under running water, but you are recommended to use a spray cleaner every now and again to maintain lubrication (especially in hard water areas - where scale build up on the razor may become an issue). It is annoying that the shaver cannot be used at all while charging - you get max power with the shaver plugged in and I worry that as the battery wears this shaver will become weaker and weaker - It's annoying not to be able to have a max power shave whenever required - on 3-4 day beards you get painful pulling with a weak battery powered shave.The shave quality is ok, but does require several applications to get a really close shave, and it can feel a bit rough on sensitive skin like mine - I have started applying aftershave balm - which I had never needed previously - to prevent rashes.This is probably a better choice for a first shaver, or a cheap spare shaver to take on trips etc. For dedicated long term use I would suggest going with a higher series 5 or 7 model with a swivel head and BOTH mains and battery operation (unless wet/dry is crucial for you)",3
4501,"I've had one on my phone for a few months now, the thing with these are they are actually glass, so it does chip and does crack and if shards come off the protector they can and do stick in your hand and it hurts! I'd say this is more suited for use by a lady keeping her phone in her handbag or an office worker, not for people in active jobs with pockets full of keys and other various objects as the screen protector will take damage and yes this is what it's supposed to do, but i wasn't prepared for a shard of glass to be embedded in my hand!!! I thought it would have been tough enough to withstand a busy pocket but no, if you are active and have pockets full of junk i'd recommend one of those flexible plastic jobbies, this is a little too delicate for the busy and active person.",3
4502,"I've had this for over a year now. Here's my thoughts:Pros  -Short charging time  -Battery lasts long  -waterproof so can be washed easily and used in the shower  -very good for sensitive, acne/blemish prone skin as it doesn't tug hairs and is  painless for use in even the most sensitive places (yes, even there)Cons  -Doesn't actually shave properly, even when it was brand new, to get a close shave  I've always had to use the beard trimmer on the side to get rid of the bulk of the hair and then  use the main foil shaver to cut hairs close to the skin. I have to repeat this several times in order  to get a close shave.Even after doing this procedure, I once borrowed my friend's shaver, which was also Philips but one of the ones that has three flat circular blades, and after a single try it gave me the closest shave I've ever had! Miles better than this shaverSo I don't recommend this particular shaver and hope to get a different one soon, but I do believe Philips makes the best electric shavers.",3
4503,"I've had this screen protector on my phone for about 1 month and in that time I have not dropped it. However, it has all ready started chipping around the bottom and top corner on the left hand side. For the price it isn't terrible but I have used ones that have lasted longer and have been much more durable.",3
4504,I've had this screen protector on my phone for about 6/7 months now and whilst it has protected my screen from damage the protector itself is very scratched and the screen is a bit hard to see in some places as it's covered in scratches from general use! Good thing there's two in a pack! The instructions are also useful for tips as to how to put it on!,3
4505,"I've had this shaver for just over a year now. For the price you pay, you can't really expect it to be the best in the market. With a 3-day stubble it shaves well, clearing almost all hairs in two shaves. However, I have had to work extremely hard to get rid of smaller hairs and I usually end up with a red patch on my neck because of I've gone over it so many times. Eventually, I ended up using it as a trimmer to shave off most of the hair and pick up the rest with a razor. Will be looking for a better quality shaver.",3
4506,"I've loved Erin Kelly's previous novels but was a little disappointed with this one.  The first half is very slow going, and although the story speeds up halfway through, I wasn't convinced by the ending.  I also wasn't persuaded that the characters would act and react as they did and unfortunately it all felt a little overblown.",3
4507,"I've never really used an electric shaver much in the past so I can't really compare it much to other electric shavers. I tried using this for both a dry and a wet shave (with gel), both yielding what can only described as a mediocre shave although the wet shave was probably closer than the dry shave. Still though even the wet shave took considerable effort and time to yield decent results, but having said that it is no substitute for shaving with a blade which to a certain extent is to be expected I guess. I suppose electric shavers are really about convenience then. I did note that the shaver cannot be used when charging for obvious safety reasons, being a wet shaver I reckon they think you cannot be trusted not to jump in the shower with it plugged in. That would be too close shave than the one I got here.",3
4508,"I've reduced my review from 4 stars down to 3.As an electric toothbrush it's good, its in the higher end but it's certainly not a huge step up / next-generation of toothbrush if you already own a mid-high end Oral B from the past 4-5 years.a nice addition is it has a nice red LED to indicate your using too much pressure that's hard to miss.Anyway, I mainly dropped my score from 4 to 3 because of the charge time required - The battery lasts ""long enough"" but needing to charge it for a full day to reach maximum charge is ridiculous.Personally, I charge it in the bedroom due to my shaver socket in the bathroom not being in a convenient place & the ultra-bright Blue charging LED's light up the bedroom at night which really annoys me so I can't charge it at night (very inconvenient when you need to charge it for 24 hours...)After that, another complaint would be from full charge the thing clearly cleans at full pace and it feels like you're getting an exceptional cleaning session but after 2 brushes the power drops down a fair amount, it's still good and it's still strong but theirs an obvious power drop I wouldn't have expected from modern day batteries.Also the Bluetooth, while it is very gimmicky it still leaves a lot to be desired - the brush claims to Store up to 20 sessions then you can just sync it with the app on your phone and personally while I do get the ""Sync'd"" alert on my phone, nothing actually changes statistic wise - so unless I'm brushing with the phone application open it's pretty useless. (Just for the record: I'm using an HTC One M8)All in all, it's a good brush but when Oral B claim this thing has an RRP of £230 they must be living in cuckoo land - even at Amazon's £82 price - I'd probably suggest going for the model below it as you only miss out on Bluetooth which is gimmicky, you do end up with toothpaste splashing on your phone & at the end of the day do you really want people being able to look at an app on your phone and see you only did a 1 minute 2-star brush today.",3
4509,"I've struggled to get on with electric shavers for any real length in time, I find myself migrating back to the wet razor shave after a few weeks.I was hoping that this top of the range model would help me stay with the electric, but spending £200 will still leave you with a few short-comings.I tried using it completely dry at first, but the results were patchy at best (this after 3 days of growth).  Adding a few drop of shave oil helped things a fair bit, giving better results but not completely smooth.  The best results were used with a good quality shaving gel.The lengthy and noisy cleaning station does a good job, but the replacement cartridges don't make this practical for everyday use for me.  Maybe once or twice a week to give it a good clean, and use the tried and tested method of running it under a hot tap for the majority of cleans.The precision trimmer is a bit of an afterthought.  I've never found one of an electric shaver that does more than an average trim, perhaps because the market is awash with products that are designed to trim there's no necessity to produce a model that does both well?The shaver is clearly designed to stay in the charger/washer, doing both in under an hour, so you should find the unit fully charged the majority of the time.  Taking the shaver on your travels (in the nice travel pouch), will of course mean you may end up leaving the charger at home.  However, with a full charge you should get around 50 minutes of use, so enough for most trips away even with daily use.This shaver is well built, will give you a good clean shave, but only with using shaving oil or gel.  For me, this defeats the purpose of having an electric shaver.  I'll get a better closer shave using a razor and without the additional hassle of charging, cleaning (for around 40 minutes a time), and replacing cleaner cartridgesYou'll get similar results from a cheaper model, and whilst this model is clearly a quality product I don't think the additional expense is justified by the results.",3
4510,I've tried several electric shavers. This is just the same as the rest in my opinion. No shaver seems to be able to cut my neck hair. I go over and over and over the same bloody hair and it won't touch it. I then go over the same area so many times it gets irritated and either bleeds or I get a nice big rash.Back to the trusty Gillette Fusion Blade for me.,3
4511,I’m bald and I bought this to shave my head with as I am fed up with getting razor bumps on the back of my neck. It’s pretty decent. Still get bumps but not as often. No good for shaving your neck though.It’s not a bad bit of kit. Bit pricey though.7/10,3
4512,Ideal for blocking out sun at night during summer months. However found it a bit fiddly and the suction pads sometimes don't stick.,3
4513,"If you don't have a Series 7 shaver, this gives a fantastic shave and is well recommended. Easy to use and very effective.If you have a series 7 and are considering upgrading, you may find what follows of use. I've used a Series 7 shaver for years, so when Amazon offered me this to review, I was quick to accept. I've been very happy with the Series 7, finding it effective, robust and a quality product.The 9 improves on the 7 by including additional shaving tools in the head - it's about 50% larger than the 7. It does away with the vibration settings and also has a completely different set up for the trimmer. Overall it's a larger and slightly heavier unit but still easy to handle. It shaves incredibly well - slightly closer than the 7.The finish is poorer than the 7 though, with the chrome both less easy to grip and quick to tarnish. The 7s rubberised finish is nicer. The 7 also has a more effective status control with the LCD easy to understand - unlike the bar and drop symbols used on the 9. I have no idea what they mean but I stick it in the cleaner everyday anyway so don't need to.The cleaning station has also changed - it's bigger and rather than using induction to dry the shaver, it has a fan - which is quite loud, goes on for a long time and is therefore annoying - if you have an en-suite, don't clean the shaver just before going to bed! You also fill it from the back not the front which means taking the whole unit off the shelf - unlike the 7 which would be done from the front.All in all its a great shaver - but not if you've already got a 7. There is nothing compelling to justify an upgrade and if anything, you may end up a bit disappointed - it's better in some ways, but worse in others, particularly the cleaning station.",3
4514,"Ignore the Bluetooth, throw away the useless brushing guide, this is a fine electric toothbrush on its own.Mega expensive, but certain annual deals make this an affordable and top quality toothbrush. If only the batteries lasted a few more years or were replaceable without a soldering iron, then it would be perfect.Addendum: reliability an issue. After 16 months the on/off and mode switches have started playing up. I suspect water has encroached on the electrical components. The brush is now rather unreliable.",3

4516,"In 1999 Laura and her boyfriend Kit decided to watch the total eclipse by taking part in the Lizard Festival in Cornwall. It’s shortly after the eclipse that they are making their way back to their tent when Laura sees two people having sex. However, it’s the expression on the girl’s face that leads Laura to act immediately as she is sure that the girl is being raped. Laura stays with the girl while Kit follows the male and tries to make a citizen’s arrest.The decision that Laura makes that day to help Beth, the girl she saw being attacked, has major repercussions on all four lives which are best described as being like a tsunami. Everything they’ve ever known or done before is swept away. None of them will ever be the same again.The story is told by Laura and Kit in the present day (2015) with flashbacks to the day it all happened. (1999).Why am I only giving 3 stars? After all, Erin Kelly is the co-author of Broadchurch, one of my all-time favourite television series. It’s mainly because of the characters and also the way some of the situations are portrayed. I took a dislike to Laura and again I’m sure someone will ask me why? After all, she did the right thing to intervene and rescue Beth. She even becomes friends with Beth, giving her support long after the trial and all its repercussions, but her self-righteousness got under my skin.Kit, Laura’s husband is a reasonably nice person but doesn’t have the backbone to stand up to Laura and lets a situation, that could have been easily resolved, become a major stumbling block.Beth, is well portrayed as the victim of the rape, who then suffers years of abuse by the rapist’s family. Erin Kelly has captured the rape, the trial and the events afterwards with great sensitivity and one can fully understand what damage this can do to anyone who is subjected to this degrading vicious crime.I also thought that a lot of research went into the rapist who is the son of very wealthy people, who would stop at nothing to get the result they want for their son.Now, having got to this point in the review, I’m thinking maybe I’m being mean and should really give an extra star, but then the ending flashes into my mind and I end up once again thinking “Really?”. I just felt that Erin Kelly managed to kill off the story too conveniently.TreebeardBreakaway Reviewers received a copy of the book to review.",3

4518,"Indeed a shocking twist and gripping story. I don't know there's something lacking though. Too much informations on certain subjects (the trip to Faroe Island) made it somewhat boring, some others deserved a bit more elaboration (Beth character is a bit of a mystery when she's such a central part), the endding is unplausible. Overall a good read for a long journey.",3
4519,"Initially I really enjoyed this book. The eclipse theme was really interesting and the emotional tone really engaging. The feel of the book changed as the story progessed to reveal it is a thriller at heart. It's confusing at times shifting between past and present. It's central characters are presented in one way and then become something else entirely, a twist that draws a gasp but ultimately makes you feel a bit deceived and the presentation of the characters up until that point somewhat one dimensional",3

4526,"Issues:I wasn't really expecting what I got in the sense that the width of the screen protector literally only just fits over the screen width (see photos) instead of extending just a little bit further. I also expected it to be a bit longer and just for over a bit more of the screen as it doesn't seem to cover the entire screen.That said, perhaps it's because I am new to the use of an iPhone 6S's curved screen so perhaps that is the case with all screen protects like this.It's not the highest quality protector in the sense that it leaves bubbles around the edges of the protector. Doesn't affect your screen but if you're pedantic about your phone looking perfect, this maybe isn't the one for you.Also it's pretty thin so it will probably break within the first drop. That said, it is cheap. If you want something to look good/and or last then I'd spend a bit more in that case. On the other hand:Positives:if you don't mind the above issues, the good things are the price and the fact it does the job. It's a very good price for a two pack, believe it's the cheapest one I managed to find. It's nothing too special- simple tempered glass protector and will do the job so no frills etc.Application was very easy and it came with a dust cleaner and a couple of stickers.Conclusion:* good if you literally want something to protect your screen in the short term and not too bothered about finesse and quality and constantly replacing it* not for those who want something that looks good and will last day more than a 30cm drop.",3
4527,"It actually is a good product but three stars because the clock and bluetooth etc are just a lot of clutter - I wish I had just stuck to the basic rechargeable toothbrush with brush heads costing around 30-40 quid - all else including the unnecessarily large packaging are just additional clutter to justify the rather steep high price of 150 odd quid (though I paid a ""discounted"" price of 55!).",3

4547,IT has european plug,3
4548,"It has two problems1- it does not cover the whole area, leaving the sides exposed where last time I got a cracked screen when my iphone landed on its side.2- it does have fingerprints on it, not like what is advertised.3- while it does block the view from the sides, it fails on the front (i.e looking from the vertical POV not the Horizontal POV",3
4549,"It is a great idea and works reasonably well.  The only problem, which can be a big one, is that the sticker pads often don't stick well to the window and can need re-applied a number of times before they finally stick.",3
4550,"It is a great product but you can't add all the apps you want. I specifically contacted Amazon before buying it to ask if my son would be able to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited on it and Audible as that was our main reason for purchase. I was told, in writing, that he would be able to. After 2 months of trying to battle it out and several calls with Amazon they have told me that it is not possible to use those apps on the device. I did manage to get Audible app for him via my user id on it, but no music. Not ideal. Am frustratingly having to return it and buy a normal version and an extra case - all of which is more expensive now than when I purchased it on Black Friday. I don't understand why it is not possible to have access to those apps for the kids - filtered would be great on audible and music. But if not on the kids user ID, then at least for an adult to be able to listen to the amazon music app on their ID....",3
4551,"It is a substantially sized blind, as a petite person I struggled to put the blind up on my own and did need additional help, however when it was put up it did manage to block out about 80% of the light which was wonderful when trying to get a toddler to sleep in the height of summer. Occasionally the suckers would come unstuck and a corner of the blind would come down however this was not a mayor problem and just required  a quick daily check before bedtime. I would not recommend this blind if you are looking to put it up and take it down on a daily basis as it is a faff, however for travelling and holidays it was worth it. Another point to note, it takes skill to put it back into its carry bag as I have yet to discover how to compact it down to its original size after opening.",3
4552,"it is about 1mm too small, I read the same thing before I bought it and didn't think I would mind but its highly irritating, especially for the price, there's only 2 in a pack and there's dust caught underneath mine. I'm reluctant to use the second one since it will be a waste.",3
4553,"It is an electric toothbrush that costs £70. No amount of app connectivty etc is going to justify that. It is a good toothbrush, and if you really want all the connectivity stuff then you'll like it, but I'd recommend getting a non-'smart' one. The toothbrush itself though is very good and feels like it does a good job on my teeth. It is *really* loud though.",3
4554,It is decent screen only issue is that it doesn't cover the edges of my iphone wouldnt buy this one again,3
4555,"It is just as well they include two screen protectors in the package.  The first one I tried to put on would not go on to my satisfaction.  I followed the directions to a T.  It always looked dirty under the Protector and I think this was due to something being wrong with the adhesive as the iPhone screen was spotless.  The second one went on very well and there was not that problem and am very satisfied with that one.  However, you should not have to use two to get the result you want.",3
4556,It is necessary to review his beard with a razor.,3
4557,"It is ok, the sustainability hasn't been tested yet, so will see how that performs. I have used JEtech before and the phone fell down quite a few times and damaged the protective screen but not the phone so i am hoping the same quality from this. I do feel that the spy cover wasn't the best choice as it dims the display quite a bit, not a product fault but just the way the dark screen works. Perhaps il go back to my transparent screen protector once I need to change. The kit has everything you need to put the protector so thats good and consistent from JETech.",3
4558,"It is ok. Not as powerful as my last brush. After a week of brushing, it takes probably 10-12hrs to fully charge.",3
4559,"It is quite small, and is difficult to cut. You have to push down for an efficient cut. Although it is cheap and does the job. Plus it is easily stored.",3
4560,"It is satisfactory and comfortable to handle but the electric lead to the razor [needed when charging the battery] has a poor connection.The lead falls 'out' of its position which defeats the object!The manufacturer should be made aware of this lack of precision. Also the recharge connection is heavy and if using a Skytronic adaptor, purchased  separately,again the lead tends to fall out of the adaptor.Why these obvious faults were not identified by Braun is hard to believe as in all other respects the shaver itself is of good quality.",3
4561,"It is slightly thin vs the full frontal face of the phone,you have to get it absolutely perfect to cover the screen section, had it been slightly wider it would have been far better.  As they provide 2, i think its value for money so just get a good frontal lipped phone case and this will be fine",3
4562,It is very good and easy to use but I wish that it was  Kierra which one I was Buying,3
4563,it is very good but not as good as a wet shave. still have to do 1 a week to get the bits shaver missed or dose not cut,3
4564,It looks ok now can review after 2 weeks then come result,3
4565,"It looks well protected, but I still find it a bit confusing. I don’t know how to add apps to my daughter’s screen and she finds it confusing when it’s on adult user how to swap it to hers.The apps available for kids are all mixed up and I cannot seem to filter by age or theme.Not sure if it’s just me, but yes, I find it rather complex.",3
4566,"It offers good protection to the phone and stays in place when vent mounted in the car.However, I have dropped a coupe of stars as mine has failed after relatively little use. The plastic trim on the left edge is clipped on and constantly drops off now every time I try to insert the phone. This lead to me dropping my expensive Galaxy S7 inside the car as when the trim fell off, I initially thought the whole side had failed and tried to catch it quickly resulting in the phone falling. Thankfully it landed face up and was unmarked.The sceptic may say I should simply glue it back on, but that should not really be necessary should it?",3
4567,"It proved a great machine. Couldn't believe that an electric shaver could do as well as a manual one after 32 years of razor shaving. But it did!Cant really compare with past models as my only experience was from the distant past with a Philips shave machine, but a lot must have happened ever since! The first shave was a pleasant experience, proving that the money was well spent!I changed the cartridge of the cleaning station as soon as the light turned  red. Later on however and after half a month (2 weeks) I found beard trimmings at the bottom of the station. When I removed the razor head I noticed that the machine was filthy inside and had to clean it with hot running water. Conclusion: The average life of a cartridge is max 2 weeks if you clean the machine daily.....BEST WAY OUT TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF YOUR CARTRIDGE: Always clean the head with a brush and hot running water  and the body with the brush before placing them in the cleaning station. This extends the life span of the liquid inside the station as there are no beard trimmings However the machine gave up after 2 1/2 years. I sent it to Braun who replaced the battery. It worked for a week before giving up again.....",3
4568,It really makes the room dark enough for our little one to sleep. Unfortunately we had to buy velcro to attach it to the window frame as it kept falling off.,3
4569,"It really should stay on window glass all the time, not only sometimes.",3
4570,"It started off well, but became increasingly unbelievable and unrealistic. For me it was oversaturated with information about eclipses, and the big secret that Laura kept just wasn't that big!! I guessed Kit's secret well before the end, and as for Jamie holding a grudge for all that time, why on earth would be bother especially after everything else he'd done as the years went on. I did read it in one weekend as I kept hoping it would get better, but it was too long and repetitive for my liking.",3
4571,It started so slowly and seemed not to have any direction for the first half of the book but I'm glad I stayed with it because it turned into a great story which I found hard to put down!,3
4572,It takes forever to suspend the blind and not long for the suction to come off . It keeps light out completely but only for the few minutes when the suctions stay in place. I would suggest they sew the blinds in such a way that a curtain wire can be passed through the blind if required as the suctions aren't effective,3
4573,It took me a long time to get into this book intact I was going to give it up numerous times. The twist gave this book the excitement it needed personally.,3
4574,It was a good story. I found it difficult with all the time  changes. it got a lot more tense and interesting towards the end. It is worth a read but better as a holiday book that you can read in one go.,3
4575,"It was easy to apply and the touchscreen isn't affected, but it's pretty awful in terms of fingerprints and smudges - much more so than Anker's product. In terms of durability, I've only had it for a very short time so we will see!",3
4576,"It was easy to put on but it only lasted 2 weeks and now it is cracked at the bottom. In opposite to the ones I had before, I don'y even remember my phone falling so it must have been just from the pressure with other items on my bag.",3
4577,It was going so well.... until the last few chapters.The twist was unlikely and I don't think it worked.,3
4578,"It was great to have on holiday for those many hotels that don't seem to have proper curtains. However the suckers don't necessarily give enough suction on their own, especially if you want the edges to extend beyond the glass - and it's difficult to avoid still having light shine through the folds round the edges. Maybe I'm too fussy as I prefer maximum darkness! However with a roll of packing tape to help seal the edges it did the trick, so a bit of hassle but it was worth it.",3
4579,"It was great whilst it lasted, however after 3 months the rubber stoppers broke and the metal prongs have damaged my air vent so i am returning it unfortunately.",3
4580,It was huge and didn't stick to my window. Too much effort to put it on.,3
4581,It was ok but I can't believe the premise. If she loved him she wouldn't have left him because of a one night stand years ago. This invalidates the whole story for me.,3
4582,"It was the first time I've decided to try an electric shaver.I've seen a very good reviews and a great price discount but being honest with you, I don't agree with them.I would say I've have a smooth face skin and thick stubborn. The shaver shaved my face (above the jaw line) and my mustache fairly well but when I came to the neck areas (which is much softer and more flexible than anything above my jawline) the shaver have totally failed, I've been left with lots of uncut hair and patches of hair no matter how hard I tried to twist/stretch/rotate/bend my skin under the jawline I just couldn't shave completely so I had to finish with razor.Kind of shame, I wanted a great product to give me clean shave, guess I will just settle for a '3-day' stubborn shavers.Good luck to you guys.Easy return and refund which is a huge +",3
4583,It works but this is more of a travel solution to be honest. We wanted one for our baby's bedroom to use every night and with having to re-attach suckers occasionally they do come loose during the night. And of course its fiddly to do it every night.,3
4584,"It works, but I would not trust it over bumps.",3
4585,"It would have been nice to know that this was an A5 trimmer before it arrived. Not too good at cutting on the first pass, but leaves a clean straight edge.",3
4586,It's a bit flimsy and difficult to hold the ruler down without my hand getting in the way of the slicer.  Does a reasonable job.,3
4587,"It's a decent enough read, but nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently every thriller needs a twist, and often it's what makes the thrill, but I can't help feeling that in this case the book was slightly less convincing after the twist than it was before it. The characters and settings were created well, though.",3
4588,"It's a good job I got two as one broke when I took the protective cover off it, the other one is good though",3
4589,It's a good job that this is a two pack as when it arrived one of them had already crack!!!It's a ten step application process and the instructions are written in a small font but I managed to apply it in a much easier way.Covers the display but does not reach right to the edge of the front of the phone so if that's what you want then get a different one but it doesn't bother me too much.No bubbles which is fantastic!,3
4590,"It's a good razor but I don't see the advantage over the series 7.- it's quieter. That's about it. I can't see any benefit from faster oscillation and sonic thingy to improve the cut.Things I don't like:- the head is bigger which means it doesn't shave my top lip well. I have to lock the head to get one of the cutters to work on it- the trimmer doesn't protrude enough so when doing sidies the razor head shaves your hair aboveFor me, series 7 is better value for money.",3
4591,"It's a very well built device at a very economical price, but it just doesn't shave my neck or chin to any acceptable degree, leaving a 1 day shadow even after lots of skin tugging and re-shaving (wet or dry).  It might work for you, but know that it isn't guaranteed.  With the price and the return policy you should definitely try it though.",3
4592,It's a well presented package with everything you need to clean screen and add protector. Probably.Therein lies the problem.  I wanted something I could just stick on. As a result I haven't invested the time to read the instructions and apply the cover. So can't recommend or otherwise.,3
4593,It's alright for the price (£40) but not brilliant at shaving. Leaves a lot of hair on the face and needs going over several times.,3
4594,"It's alright, the battery doesn't last very long.. I have it on the charger constantly now, so I don't have to bother.",3
4595,"It's an electric toothbrush - it cleans teeth: the rest is just embellishment.  It doesn't hold it's charge particularly well and is grossly overpriced for what it is.  Nobody has managed to design an electric toothbrush which doesn't leave a puddle of dirty water wherever it, and the toothbrush heads, stand.  If somebody does, I'll be interested.",3
4596,It's an electric toothbrush. There are extra bits for some reason.,3
4597,It's an ok shaver,3
4598,"It's been a while since my husband's used an electric shaver - just over 20 years, in fact - and it was perhaps with a little scepticism that he decided to try one of the new Braun Series 9 shavers. His old Philishave always used to leave his face feeling a little sore and raw, so he was quite interested to see how the technology had come on and to see how much difference there was between the rotary system of the Philishave and the foil system (as used by the Braun).The first slight stumbling block is that the Braun shaver only comes with a 2 pin shaver socket lead; there is no standard UK mains power adaptor provided with the set. Now these can be picked up pretty cheaply but it is a shame one isn't included as standard (especially, as my husband informs me, that his old electric shaver did actually come with one). I can't imagine that there are many homes with 2 pin shaver sockets, so it does feel like a bit of an oversight.Another niggle is that quite a bit of the manual deals with the use of the Braun cleaning station, which is also not part of this particular shaver set. However (thankfully) the Braun itself is, he informs me, pretty simple to use.Dry shaving is much more comfortable than with his old electric shaver, although he isn't entirely sure how much better the results are (I have to say that it seemed to take him far longer to get shaved than usual). He still finds that the shave isn't quite as close as having a more traditional wet shave with a safety razor (I'd have to agree), and it requires quite a few repeated ""sweeps"" to catch stubborn bristles (and even then there can be quite a few left behind).One of the features of this particular electric razor is that it also allows wet shaves with water or shaving gels and soaps. According to my husband this shave was even more comfortable than the dry shave but, although closer, it still doesn't seem quite up to the standard of his trusty safety razor.He won't say that he doesn't like the Braun or that he won't use it again (he almost definitely will while travelling, purely for the convenience), but for him it just doesn't quite measure up to the comfort and closeness of his usual shaving method.",3
4599,"It's blackout powers are beyond criticism as the fabric lets very little light through. I wish I could say the same for it's ability to stay stuck to (clean) windows. This has to be reapplied most days to the window in the room that my baby sleeps in. Once it's there it is effective, but the top row of suckers keeps popping off and dropping away from the window.Try it - but be prepared for some trial and error or to have to do something additional to keep it in place.",3
4600,"It's difficult to see why this has become a best-seller when a couple of hundred others equally formulaic get nowhere.  The focal point of the story is a violent attack on a woman, but guess what - as the story develops we get the different characters' versions and learn that things aren't quite what we thought.  Don't get me wrong - it's OK and I happily read to the end, but there's little that's going to stick in the memory and I certainly won't be on tenterhooks waiting for the next Erin Kelly.  Take it for an entertaining light read on holiday and you won't be disappointed - but you'll have forgotten it by the time you get home.",3
4601,It's fine,3
4602,It's good once you can get it up but the suckers aren't very sticky! I ended up having to pin it up which isn't really the idea behind a blind that's meant to be easy to put up and down!,3
4603,It's good value. However I couldn't fit them into my phone without having air bubbles. Took me a long time to manage it with only a few air bubble,3
4604,It's is ok for thin regular paper anything more than 200gsm do not use.,3
4605,"It's not a bad product, great price however the instructions were extremely unclear, I ended up breaking my first pritector and getting dust stuck under the other- effectively wasting my £5! I'd buy again but take great care applying!",3
4606,It's not bad but not as good as my previous Braun.  A little bit light and a bit less powerful.  I ought to have paid a bit extra for a more expensive one.,3
4607,"It's not bad. It will shave if you trim VERY close to your skin. I mean like designer stubble level (less than 1mm). Then it takes A GOOD FEW PASSES to actually achieve a smooth looking shave. Even then I had to touch up bits with a razor.So, not bad but not great either.",3
4608,It's ok,3
4609,It's ok ! still need to have a wet shave once a week it's a quick clean me up though,3
4610,It's ok but I returned mine it just would not cut my beard in the crease between my neck and chin/jaw,3
4611,It's OK but the edge of the blind is a little too close to the suckers preventing a really thorough seal. Could do with a few rounds of user testing to optimise the design.,3
4612,"It's ok for the price. I have quite thick facial hair and it's the reason I tend to use a razor. I found it works great around the chin/mouth/facial areas, but struggled to shave around the neck and side-burn areas where the hair is thicker. If you want a close all round shave I would recommend going for a slightly more expensive model.",3
4613,It's ok.,3
4614,"It's ok. Like many people have said - the suction caps are a bit frustrating - but when we got used to it, very useful in the summer months when it's still light out at 9pm!",3
4615,"It's okay, I find it takes me longer to shave than it did with my old philishave and I don't think I will be getting a foil razor again",3
4616,It's okay. Misses hairs which I then have to follow up with a manual razor.,3
4617,It's protects well but needs to be a little bigger,3
4618,It's really good for blocking the light. Just what I need it as i don't have good blinds in my bedroom. The only thing is a vit tricky to put up as one of the corners keeps falling but over all its a really good blind best I ever seen so far.,3
4619,"It's really unwieldy to use and I end up splashing toothpaste everywhere.  Also very noisy.  It's ok.  Prefer my previous Phillips sonicare, but bought this as it was on offer.",3
4620,It's very effective however it covers most of the screen. I'd say it's a bit short for iPhone 6s but cover from front camera to the bottom so not an issue.,3
4621,It's very good as it does not nick you. It doesn't give a great shave though going over the same area again and again.,3
4622,It's well made and easy to use. Doesn't exactly give you a close shave if you have a tough beard.,3
4623,"Item arrived on time, in perfect condition. Was easy to apply. However it says it is the 6s model, but it's roughly 3mm smaller than the phone all around. Doesn't look great, but hoping it will keep the screen protected so I'm leaving it on anyway. 3d touch works though!",3
4624,"Its a great idea and we've found it very useful over the past 9 months. BUT, we have now noticed the suction cups begin to lose their suction which is disappointing.Also, its vastly overpriced I think for a bit of blackout material with some suckers on.",3
4625,"Its about a s good as you'd expect a budget electric razor to be.  Its not great - no substitute for a good wet shave.  But it clips away, it does trim stuff (after you over it about 20 times!) but you cant let your beard get very long.It is impressively quiet though, I'll give it that.",3
4626,Its alot bigger than I expected so it is hard to use. good price THANKS,3
4627,"Its early days yet but I thought id share my initial thoughts.  I'm currently spending time setting this device up for my son. A few real niggles are bugging me. Dont get mine wrong this device was great value for money at 89 quid, however its pretty useless off line. Any prime downloaded content cannot be shared on your childs profile, only paid for content. There also seems no way of downloading any of the kids videos available in the unlimited subscription to use offline.  Combine this with the fact that it's really difficult to copy films into the device and share them across the profiles.  Can see this device being great with wifi but nigh on useless without.",3
4628,"Its good, when it stays up, but i spend most of the time trying to get it to stop falling down.Have also found it makes the room so much hotter.",3
4629,Its looks good and it does cut out the light very well but as another reviewer said the suckers are bit pathetic and so it falls down. As a compromise with sash windows I shut them on it at the top.,3
4630,Its not the best and especially struggles with a three day shave. already broken within 14 months,3
4631,Its ok but takes a few goes to get everything have had better but the price was very good.,3
4632,Its ok but the set up process through Amazon was complicated and involved many phone calls.,3
4633,Its ok but you have to go over the same spot 5 or 6 times to get a close shave.,3
4634,"Its OK, does the job however it is not finger print free.",3
4635,"Its ok, nothing special, slows down too much when applying anything other than light pressure. Battery life is not great.",3
4636,"Just as well you get two in a pack - the first one snapped in two whilst taking it out of the packet!! Now the other one is stuck on it seems to be ok, but it'll be interesting to see how long it lasts...",3
4637,"Just got these today put one on my wife's iPhone 6 it fit perfectly stuck all round the phone and even right up to the edge BUT on my iPhone 6s it stuck down ok but not on the edges it you can see where it's not sticking to where the edge of the screen is, So these are perfect for the iPhone 6 just not 6s!",3
4638,just ok!!!,3
4639,"Just received this product. Easy to apply and does the job, but even after applying correctly the sides have air around them and will not fully stick down, so that will cause problems with dust in the near future, and is very annoying to look at.",3
4640,"Keeps falling off, a real pain in the behind.But it's really good when it stays on.",3
4641,"Kept me guessing.... who was honest? Who was genuine? All in all it held my attention, had me thinking...in particular about two main characters, who we don't get a first person perspective from...foe me the rad was ""OK""",3
4642,"Let's make something clear. The product is worth 5 stars!BUT its very frustrating taking out wipes from it... The way the wipes were folded in is just not what you used to or expect.I gave 3 stars because every nappy change is a struggle. Especially when I try to make it quick nappy change in the middle of the night.I expected if I take out one wipe, it will pull the next one out too. BUT NO...BUT again the product worth 5 STARS",3
4643,Lets start off by saying they are packaged really nicely with a great kit for clean your phones screen before applying. However they are really fiddley to apply. Once on our phones we have had a few problems with 3D Touch we also found they break really easily. However they have saved my phone from a 20ft drop on to a road surface so they are up to the job.,3
4644,Light will always come through don't be fooled but it covers most of the window,3
4645,"Like that is comes with tools to assist easy and smooth application, not as strong as I thought it would be. It’s a goid thing is it comes with two, would still buy again tbh.",3
4646,"Like the idea and used for some time but sadly not as good at cleaning away poop, more expensive, and gave baby a rash which cleared when we changed to Johnson’s sensitive qipes",3
4647,Like this item - it's a shaver and by a make famous for them.It's waterproof - always handy.Feels a decent weight but not heavy.Like how the set comes with attachments and so beard can be trimmed to length but is a normal shaver too.,3
4648,"Liked this book very much. Nicely balanced between easy to put down if distracted on holiday, whilst also being a real page turner in places. Would read more from this author.",3
4649,Listened to this on hioliday. Not my cup of tea im afraid. Think I'll stick to tv.,3
4650,Little bit teenage in parts but excellent twist that keep me reading ! All in all an enjoyable easy read,3
4651,little smaller than I through  don't do A3,3
4652,Long winded in some parts with quite a good storyline and a twist at the end found it hard to concentrate,3
4653,"Lost interest before half way through. Couldn't get into it at all and not very believable story,",3
4654,Lots of twists easy to read and follow but I’m not really a great fan.,3
4655,Love the fact the wipes came ealy cant wait to use it :) PS hopefully its good,3
4656,"Love the product, all natural, great for bottom and the face etc, all good all around.However the packaging drives me crazy as it's impossible to take just ONE wipe of the pack. ALWAYS at least FIVE go out. It's impossible to pull the wipes by one hand. That's incredible annoying especially when changing the baby at night half asleep fighting with the packaging.Using johnson's extra sensitive for night nappy change as can't fight this",3
4657,"Love this seller, but these earrings were much smaller stone than my last order with pewterhooter. The description was exactly the same. So bit surprised. I also buy bulk. Will not put me off from buying again, just need to order next size up apparently",3
4658,Love this toothbrush but after just 8 months the battery won't charge properly and its unusable. Absolutely infuriating as the Phillips Sonics we have had before NEVER had an issue with batteries.It gives an amazing clean - no hygienist required anymore - but do I really have to pay £80 every 8 months?!,3
4659,Lovely and thick but pointless as it doesn't stick on the window....,3
4660,"Lovely product, though bit pricey and heavy for ordering online. They would be great if they were dry and one added the water when nappy changing / using the wipe.  Then they could have a travel version of them which are already wet.",3
4661,"Managed to break the 1st screen just by trying to get it on probably user error. 2nd screen has been on for 2 weeks ish. And has already cracked without any/very little abuse, although it has done its job and protected my screen.. So I can't fault it for that",3
4662,Mediocre reading. Ok but never really got me locked in.  I could easily have put it down and not bother to finish it.,3
4663,meh,3
4664,"Misleading regarding the charger, I read and believed that the charger would be included however packaging then stated not all  razors are supplied with charger.",3
4665,"Mixed feeling on this.  This is a really big shaver, much larger than my rotary Philips electric shaver, this is both a good and a bad thing.  Good because it cuts down shaving times, bad because it loses precision.  My skin has always hated blade shaves, so I have always been electric, and usually rotary, each time I try out a Braun shaver, always came away unimpressed.  This time however this didn't happen.  It gave me a decent shave quickly, and handled problem neck hairs very well (better than my Philips), battery life between charges is exceptional - 2 weeks of daily shaves it's lost 20% (assuming the bars showing the charge are linear).  As I mentioned, my skin is very sensitive to shaving changes, I haven't had any issues, initially I thought I would, as the first time switching it on, it seemed to be much more ""aggressive"" than my rotary shaver.The cleaning station, hmm, even more mixed feelings about this.  Sure it works, but does it work any better than running it under the tap?  Slightly, perhaps.  However that is offset by running costs (the cleaning packs), and the bulk.  It's also quite noisy doing it's cleaning cycle.  Will I continue to use the cleaning station once the fluid has run out?  Unlikely.My other gripe, is a shaver costing this much, it feels really cheaply made, the plastic ""chrome"" especially.  I also found the placement of the wet/dry slider button poorly thought out, frequently sliding it during use (not that it really does much aside from tightening up the shaving head).So this isn't a bad razor, it does give a good shave, and it doesn't irritate my skin, but I can't help feeling it's not as high end as the price-tag implies, and the cleaning station is a bit gimmicky.  It does however have a very nice travel pouch!!",3
4666,MIXED VIEW ON THIS SHAVER1. Excellent clean shave one of the better ones I have had2. I find the head do come off when you try and clean with brush supplied3. Once the heads come off they don't always fit back properly and shave vibrates and when shaving the blades tend to fall off4. Braun customer service not very helpful5. Amazon were very good and replaced it straight away as it was only a few weeks oldAlthough I am happy overall I am concerned at the quality and suspect as I use it will cause problems,3
4667,"Moved from an old Series 3 to this one.  Definitely offers a much closer shave (I never use them wet, even though they say you can).  Good at dealing with 3 or 4 days' stubble too.  Battery performance is a big improvement.Downsides are: it does not come with a plastic case like the old Series 3, which is a pain when travelling as I used to bung the old one in my hand baggage, cannot do that with this one, as the foil guard falls off too easily.  It is more difficult to use the trimmer function, you need 2 hands to get it to come out.  The foil head is a LOT more difficult to clean - so I expect it not to last as long as the old model.  That's progress, I suppose.",3
4668,"Much better than previous version (7inch old version). Faster boot up, still got some glithes ( freezing). Glad its got bigger memory. Pity you have to buy the screen protector. You don't need the accessories ( lesson learnt with old version). Comes with all you need ( tablet and cover).",3
4669,"Much better than the S6 one i brought, but the fact that it doesn't cover the whole front of the phone is still a big deal imo",3
4670,Much finer than expected. I thought they would have been more solid. Very pretty though. Find them awkward to put on and afraid I might lose one. A little disappointing.,3
4671,"must admit i picked a cheapy, and it kinda showed. have to be very careful how you use this, or poor results follow. adequate for my wife and her business.",3
4672,"My daughter's favourite toy, but I still don't understand why she cannot play (downloaded) apps in the car. It's a MISTERY for me. Anyone can answer?",3
4673,"My husband  (who is in his 50s) has only ever used a cheap Bic razor and is happy with that. However, for the purpose of the review I asked him to give his shaver up and test this one. He remarked that it looks well made and is sturdy. I think it is a little too sturdy and is a little on the heavy side. For the money, I would have preferred a better (and larger) bag. It does everything that a razor should do but he won't be giving up his trusty Bic yet. If you like gizmos and have plenty of money to spare then try this.",3
4674,"My husband has used this so I have to go on his response.  He is pleased with the shave that this produces. It gives a close shave and the mix of cutting plates enable him to get into all the more difficult to reach area.  He hasn't yet tried it wet, but considers it to be as good as other electric shavers her has used.  However...I the told him how much it costs and he immediately changed his perspective.  He considers that for the significantly larger price tag, the quality of the shave is not proportionately better than cheaper models he has used.  So whilst it's a nice item, it might not be considered value for money.",3
4675,"My husband says this is ok, not brilliant but gets the job done.",3
4676,My husband seems happy with this product.,3
4677,My old shaver does the exact same job for 30£. It is very difficult to get the neck hairs.,3
4678,"My real rating is 2 and a half as we only received one screen in the box the other was a dud so unfortunately as wonderful as the product is we were short on quantity, sorry for the negative review but just being honest .",3
4679,My son kept borrowing my old Braun so I gave him it & got this new one. The shave is ok but you do need to go over some areas quite a few times especially under the chin area which can irritate the skin if you press too hard. One thing missing from this new one is the locking button to hold down one of the shaving foils as this makes shaving directly under the nose area easier but a minor thing. My fault as I didn't notice this at the time so nothing to do with the shaver itself but did like this function on my older one.Seems quieter than my older Braun & charges much quicker but this might be down to the age of the shaver as the older one is a few years old & has been charged many times but who knows.Seems well made & not too many complaints based on what I actually paid for it. It does the job reasonably well.,3
4680,"my young granddaughter loves this and has uploaded mr tumble etcBUTshe holds it and puts her fingers on the side of the screenwhich stops it working interactively!as when she tries to interact it only works with no touching fingers!really wish it had handles, tried buying a sleeve for it but didnt fit",3
4681,Natural and handy for nappy changes...just very wet! When my son had nappy rash we had to give up on these and revert to cheeky wipes (Terry towelling wipes).,3
4682,Never as good as a razor!,3
4683,"Nice and affordable enough considering it has 2 protectors. Not sure if it's a perfect fit for iPhone 6s, as it doesn't cover the entire screen 100% - can see edges are not protected.",3
4684,Nice and sparkly but a bit flimsy,3
4685,"Nice and thick, protects screen well. Doesn’t quite reach edges of phone though.",3
4686,nice but a lot smaller than expected,3
4687,"Nice package, nice machine, but it does not shave flawlessly, alas. One has to work at it and an average shave takes longer than with other Brauns I have owned. It also does not work when charging, so if you are out of charge there is no quick solution to your needs with this machine. I do like the fact it can be cleaned under running water, and the trimmer is adequate too. Will I keep using it for now ? Most likely, yes. Will I buy another one ? Most likely, no.",3
4688,Nice product and gives a good shave but still not as close as the standard razor.,3
4689,Nice read but not as gripping add I though it would be,3
4690,"Nicely designed and good functionality although the smart Bluetooth functions are probably more a novelty than useful. Seems quite noisy compared to other brands, and annoyingly is not multi-voltage which can be a problem for travel.",3
4691,"No unfortunately the item did not meet my expectations as it is not stable on the vents in my car which is no fault of the product, it just meant that I had to purchase the holder with the long arm instead which attaches to the windscreen",3
4692,"No what I expected. Quite pricy yet the suction cups don't do the job and it keeps falling off the window, had to tape it. Really disappointed.",3
4693,Nonsensical plot. Far too girly. Too many red herrings.,3
4694,"Not a bad cutter but not the best either, you have to push down very hard for it to cut and it can only cut one sheet at a time. Delivery was earlier than expected",3
4695,"Not a bad idea& quality seems nice, however it makes much more sense to buy a roll up black out blind or curtains as it's either permanently dark in the room or you have to go through the trouble of in clipping grocurtain from your window & then putting it back on every night- seems like a waste of a precious time !",3
4696,"Not a bad product for the price, ideal for home use only, small enough to tuck away in a drawer",3
4697,Not a bad read just to much info on eclipses,3
4698,Not a bad shaver but the head only lasted three months before having to change it. The second head its lasting a bit longer.I payed half the price of the shaver for a new head. Yikes.,3
4699,Not a bad story and in parts very good. It was slow to start with and got better as the story progressed. Not greatly likeable characters and far too much about eclipses for my taste but that said it was an ok read. My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for a chance to review this book.,3
4700,"Not a bad toothbrush. Problem is I like to brush my teeth harder than it likes, and this one deliberately slows down if you do that, so it's annoying. Previous models of the Triumph didn't do that, so this is an annoying feature. Hence the three stars, because I sometimes revert back to my old Triumph. Bluetooth feature is also a gimmick. Don't pay the extra Wonga for that function.",3
4701,"Not a close shave at all, most dissapionted",3
4702,Not a great cut but ok,3
4703,"Not a very good fit for the Iphone 6s. because the edges are slightly rounded on the phone, this leaves a halo around the protector almost like it has not stuck properly. Surprised this happens even though the protector does not go all the way to the edges. Have attached a photo to show how it looks like.",3
4704,Not able to instal YouTube kids which sucks.,3
4705,"Not all suction cups stay up properly, and bigger than my needs, but overall fulfills the expectations.",3
4706,Not as close shav I was expecting I have to go over number of times,3
4707,not as good a design as I thought it was but it may be useful,3
4708,Not as good a shave as expected,3
4709,"Not as good as expected, cuts long hairs but not so good for short hairs.",3
4710,Not as good as I expected at the three-day beard.,3
4711,Not as good as I expected ok for very short stubble but 3 days and it struggled I was often left with red skin after going over areas again and again.Back to wet shaving for me.,3
4712,"Not as good as i expected. Problem is the cutting face is not flexible an is not as effecientround the cocners as say a 3 blade Phillips, otherwise OK.",3
4713,Not as good as I thought .Worth paying a bit more for better quality. Having said that it is good enough for my needs.,3
4714,"Not as good as previous model, the best thing it is quieter",3
4715,"Not as good as promised after reading about the article.Complicated to set up, so only using as a toothbrush.Cheaper models would have been better",3
4716,Not as good as the Panasonis Arc 5. Which is half the price.,3
4717,Not as good quality as the competition... But good price,3
4718,Not as I expected. It says that it is A4 but it is A5 very small. Package lost in transit and it took hours to find a phone no to call.,3
4719,Not as long as expected. Look very pretty!!!,3
4720,Not as sharp as I expected.,3
4721,Not as strong as other glass protectors I have purchased as you can easily bend it. However stuck on to my phone well and hopefully does the job.,3
4722,Not Bad,3
4723,Not bad but disappointed as was expecting a much closer shave based on the other reviews,3
4724,Not bad but not as good as I thought it would be.,3
4725,Not bad but the corners come off after a couple of weeks and will not stick down after a bit so you have too take it all of again and start again if you can lol nice try,3
4726,Not bad for price but the screen protector doesn't quite cover the whole screen,3
4727,"Not bad, but nor as close as wet shave. So use it for daily quick shave.",3
4728,"Not bad, have had better Shavers",3
4729,"Not bad, started interesting then dipped but then took 70% of the book before it got really interesting. Liked it but didn't love it.",3
4730,Not bad.,3
4731,Not bad. A bit contrived. Good easy read but could have been really gripping with some more depth. Felt a little like the author had a preset formula / number of pages. Buying for 99p though it's a bargain.,3
4732,NOT BEST AS REALLY FIDDLEY TO PUT ON WINDOW AS KEPT FALLING ... EVENTUALLY GOT IT UP...BUT MUST BE BETTER WAY THAN THIS ... as only need when twins are staying ...,3
4733,Not brilliant to be honest  - ok for a quick once over but never gets close and struggles with those niggly bits near your jaw lane and chin. i wet shave again now and just keep this at work in case I need to meet a client,3
4734,"Not cheap, but really useful for new parents. Used these in hospital instead of the awful cotton wool and water method. easy and kind to baby's skin. EDIT: dropped a star because it's often impossible to pull out a single wipe at a time, which is a but wasteful. Also wipes themselves appear to be standard synthetic ones",3
4735,"not easy to fix to window, been put away in a cupboard for now.... lets sunlight in where i wanted to use it",3
4736,Not every effective. If I use foam I have to do three or four times to get a clean shave,3
4737,not for heavy duty useblade not too sharp,3
4738,Not generally a fan of screen protectors in the past - this is better but I still struggled to get it perfect without any bubbles / marks under the film - despite following the cleaning instructions exactly - you can still see small bubble-like marks when you tilt the screen into the light.Will try it again with the second screen protector in the pack and will review again if it's any better,3
4739,Not great but not poor at the same time,3
4740,Not great for ‘mature’ stubble growers. Doesn’t cut too great prob best for those with very soft stubble...,3
4741,Not great for different beats lengths for example if you just wanted to trim but it is good for a clean shave.,3
4742,"Not great, but not bad.. my main issue is the suckers, some of them simply dont stick, they seem too flat to be able to create any suction on the surface.  Im sure they could be made much better.",3
4743,Not great..it is not as sharp and professional as one would expect..fair quality..Thank you.,3
4744,"Not much to say from it works and fits my Audi A5 air vents. However, slide a phone the wrong way (say to the right with the wordage correctly orientated) and the head comes off the clip. The solution is to turn the head upside down and then slide to the right.",3
4745,"Not my kind of thriller, but was an ok read",3
4746,"Not overly fanatical about electric shavers. Once you have used a blade nothing comes close. That said I have been pleased with this shaver, albeit not that close, but it gives my face a rest when it comes to shavers rash!",3
4747,"Not overly pleased with this. I accidentally dropped one screen protector onto  a wooden floor and it split in two.  I didn't find it easy to fit and yes it doesn't cover whole screen, but it's on there so we will see how it goes.",3
4748,Not perfect but kind of good. Next time i wouldn't buy it. Why is it with european charger??? I was expecting GB charger....,3
4749,Not quite 4 stars for me as I found the opening rather slow and frustrating. The 'big event ' alluded to early on gets rather tedious and I just wanted the story to get a move on. However once it finally got going there were a few plot twists that I didn't guess. I liked the settings around eclipses which was unusual and actually quite informative. The author must either live in London or have spent a lot of time there as there are large junks of descriptions of the city which I could have cheerfully skipped over. Still on the whole worth a read.,3
4750,Not quite as good as I thought.Never used an electric shaver before. Bought to avoid wet shaving following an operation on my neck...It's not bad other reviews adequately describe its appearance and functionI found it struggled to give me a close and even shave particularly those sneaky hairs on my neck which grow parallel to the skin.In summary OK for a quick skim but nowhere near the cut of a real wet shave for me and needs tidying with a bladeYou pays your money and takes your chance,3
4751,"Not quite as good quality as some of the more expensive protectors out there, (some slightly ""rough"" finishes) but it was good value for money and offers good protection for the phone.",3
4752,"Not really cutting a straight line like the guideline. Have to adjust to experience. Not to sharp as well, the photos don't really get a clean cut especially when you put 2 photos in 1 go.",3
4753,Not so effective on 1-2 day stubble,3
4754,Not so powerful as you can wish for...,3
4755,not spectacular but will do.,3
4756,Not sure about this - doesn't shave that well in my view.,3
4757,Not sure its the most effective shaver out thereI do prefer my old Philips,3
4758,"Not that impressed, edges have lifted and protector is expensive for what it is.",3
4759,Not the best for card..spend the extra it will be worth it,3
4760,Not the best one but it's acceptable.,3
4761,not the best quality,3
4762,Not the best results. Takes a long time to get a close shave when using this.,3
4763,"Not the best shave in the world, it does the job but does miss long hairs and its not very rough if left for a few days",3
4764,"Not to impressed with this. I had another very very similar electric toothbrush witht the bluetooth etc. and it was really very good indeed. So when I saw this one come up I was very keen to get another for when I travel away (which, recently, is a lot.) Now bare in mind this is suppossed to be a travelling toothbrush (complete with travel case etc.) I was really really dissapointed to find that after fully charging it on a Saturday and packing it away that by the Tuesday the motor and power seemed to have dropped off dramatically. No longer that immediate frenzy you get when fully charged. I thought it might be I had selected a different mode (rediculous new modes .... all they are or seem to be is variation on speed. Really ??? THAT makes a difference??? I don't think so.) I think we have reached the same point we reached with mobile phones. a load of different brushes and modes and bluetooth and other gimmicks but it's time to get the basics like battery and motor sorted.Very dissapointed. My old one is still better.",3
4765,Not too good,3
4766,Not up to the standard of my previous Braun Razor,3
4767,not very easy to install,3
4768,Not very good for small windows,3
4769,Not very practical but did the job ok,3
4770,Not wowed by these. Good value but harsh material and not that wet.,3
4771,"Nothing really spectacular. Get a better shave from my older Braun Contour 5874. Long hair trimmer though is not a great success.Easier to clean than my earlier Brauns. Good grip. Inhibit switch though, somewhat annoyingly prevents shaving whilst charging.",3
4772,"Nothing special, in my opinion if you wet shave then carry on doing just that. This product is no way near as good as doing that.",3
4773,Nothing wrong with it but just a bit difficult to use ..... had to press down really hard to trim A4 paper ...I use it for my school stuff... wouldn't really recommend it but it does do the job though.....Also doesn't fit A4 paper horizontally,3
4774,Nothing wrong with the quality of the product but disappointed that the design is such that it does not completely cover the screen of the iPhone 6S that I specifically bought it for.,3
4775,Noticed crack on the screen after 2 weeks of purchase without causing any damage,3
4776,obviously not as good as wet shave but is adequate. best when used with shaving oil instead of gel or foam.will wait and see how long the foil lasts before replacing. as I have a strong facial hair would require 2 shaves per day as opposed to the wet shave,3
4777,"Oh Amazon. I was almost evangelical about how brilliant your services are until this evening.I’ve had prime for a few years now, and so it made sense to me that I get my children Kindle Fire tablets for Christmas. I read some reviews and thought it made sense to have platform continuity as I could use my prime account to give my kids access to shows they love and watch at home on TV.Tonight we decided to download their favourite shows to their tablets as we’re away for the weekend. Pretty quickly we realised it wasn’t working, the videos selected weren’t downloading. We called customer services and spent 45 minutes on the phone talking through errors only to be told (eventually) that as a prime customer - I can only download 15 videos to any device associated with my account.15! So 7.5 per tablet. I’m not sure that’s going to cut it for 2 x 4 hour car journeys.The answer of course is buying content - you can apparently download as much of that as you like.Rules are rules, they’re not going to change them because of my review or feedback. However I do feel mislead. Why isn’t this made obvious in the description or specifics of the item page, so people are aware BEFORE they purchase?I asked the customer service rep and he referred me to point 2 section 4 of Prime’s T&C’s (after putting me on hold for 5 mins to find where the info was). Amazon - I signed up for Prime years ago. I didn’t think to check the T&C’s before buying the tablets as I assumed that the money I pay for a Prime subscription would be enough to download episodes of Hey Duggee and the like. But no. That’s not the case.I can honestly say if this was made clear in the description/ product page I wouldn’t have bought the kindles. I would have gone with a different tablet. I’m disappointed, and my loyalty to Amazon is fading fast.3 stars - a fair review as the parental controls are good and my kids seem to be able to use them. Just not offline eh?",3
4778,Ok,3
4779,"Ok but a bit annoying having to take it down each day, I wish I had brought curtain linings to attach into the thin curtains I have. Room definitely darker, but complete blackout no!",3
4780,Ok but clip wears quickly,3
4781,Ok but doesn't really seem to fit the screen it remains slightly proud of the screen at the edges. The instructions are written in a font so small as to be unreadable!,3
4782,Ok but fell off a few times now,3
4783,Ok but no where near as close a shave as a wet razor blade,3
4784,Ok but not as tidy as other dearer brands. You gets what you pays for I suppose,3
4785,OK but smaller than I thought.,3
4786,OK for a battery portable,3
4787,Ok for the price,3
4788,"Ok for the price but , maybee my hairs different , wet or dry it struggled with the hair under my chin , seem they grow faster overnight",3
4789,Ok I finished book I had to keep checking characters to remember,3
4790,Ok just,3
4791,"Ok product, but does not stick to the window all that well even after cleaning etc and following the instructions. Found the suction cups are too ridged and let in air. In the end I have managed to stick them to the upcv Window surround even then it still let's in a fair bit ok light.",3
4792,Ok read bit far fetched and not really a thriller,3
4793,OK read.,3
4794,"OK,  but expensive if you compare with the likes of Morrisons own brand water wipes. Grab yours today for only £1 at a Morrisons near you.",3
4795,"ok, but they dont stay up well.",3
4796,"Ok, just ok, works fine, but nothing like as good as my old Philips",3
4797,"ok, nothing great tho",3
4798,"OK, Poor on shaving! Nice to have wet shave. Requires lots of work to remove hair",3
4799,OK. It's an electric razor at the cheaper end of the price spectrum. It works fine. You gets what you pays for. What can I say?,3
4800,"OK. This is OK. That's about it to be honest. I've had better screen protectors and I've had worse. Packaging is deceiving as it makes them look better than they are (so much for never judging a book by its cover but hey, we're all fickle creatures...!), my problem with these is they scratch too easily, my old ones were on for about 4 months and only had a couple of scratches, these, from them just sitting in my pocket and changing no habits of use whatsoever, were scratched after two days of my phone sitting in my pocket. Luckily there is two of them in a pack so I'll use the other in a month or so (probably why there are two in a pack for the same price as one of the 'better' ones). I probably wouldn't buy these again but then again I wouldn't totally discount them either. Overall an average purchase.One final note; All those complaining about the protector not hitting the exact edges of the phone, no offence intended but your iPhone 6 has curved edges, no screen protector will go to the very edge.",3
4801,OK. You need both hands to put the phone in and take it out which is a bit annoying,3
4802,Okay,3
4803,"Okay but very expensive for what they are. My mother has no issues with other much cheaper brands designed for babies. These Waterwipes with less in should cost less, not more... Water and grapefruit juice. The opening is primitive with a plastic strip which comes off and does not stick again. Other cheaper brands like Morrisons, etc use a proper plastic closing lid. This 'chemical free' thing is not necessary for most. Hopefully other manufacturers will rise to the bait and put less in and cost less. Some of the prices re crazy!",3
4804,OKay for the money (cheap). I prefer Jetech ones as they bubble less than these even though they are more expensive.,3
4805,"Okay if you want to cut one piece of paper at a time, anything more than that then forget it, you need to apply constant pressure as teh cutter is so lightweight, probably better using scissors",3
4806,Okay product but have to get it perfectly on phone screen,3
4807,"Okay product, instructions however are useless and don't explain how to put it on your phone very well...",3
4808,"Okay, so 3 star is a bit of a mean rating for this toothbrush, so bear with me.The good:* Multiple heads, each with different ""action""* BluTooth connection to monitor that sticks to bathroom mirror* Multiple modes, including sensitive and intense* Sensor to detect how hard you are pressing and warnThe pressure sensor bit is excellent, and really provides some useful feedback to let you know you are using the brush right. I really want to set it to intense (3 minutes rather than 2 total) as a default, but have not found a way to do this, which is a little annoying. Which leads to the bad stuff:* Bathroom shaver plug supplied with short cable* Super bright blue LEDs that flash while chargingSo, I have a shaver plug in my bathroom. But I do not have a nearby flat surface to set up the toothbrush recharging station with all its spare brush heads and similar. The nearest place for it was the bedroom. Not a problem, but because of the shaver plug, I needed two extra purchases, a shaver to UK socket converter, and a multi gang extension because the profile of shaver to UK socket converters is too high to fit between the bedside drawers and the wall socket.After buying all these things and setting it up, I brushed my teeth then slotted the brush on the recharger, turned off the lights to sleep, and realised the toothbrush lit up the room as if I were being raided by the police. The blue lights flash for hours after plugging in, so brightly you can see them through your eyelids reflected off the walls. It is worth noting that blue LEDs are also known for triggering that bit in your eye that identifies natural sunlight and tells your body clock that it is morning. The last thing you want to see when trying to sleep is this toothbrush.The solution is to only charge the thing during the day, while I am at work. But it is so unnecessary - why not just flash for 5 seconds, so you know it has been placed correctly and is charging? Why not come with optional shaver or UK (or US or EU)  power plug? Who decided on daylight blue LEDs? I am sure others have had the same thoughts on this as me.",3
4809,On one of my screens the sticky protector would not peel off and the screen ended up breaking - god job there are two. The other was fine.,3
4810,"Once it gets hung up with some difficulty, it blocks or the light really well.",3
4811,"Once you finally get it to suck onto the window it works, getting it to stick is a pain!!",3
4812,One arrived cracked so that's why I scored 3 stars,3
4813,One of the protective covers had damage. Scratch on the glass which was visible when put on phone.,3
4814,"One of the protectors were damaged but overall, good quality.",3
4815,One of the two protectors was scratched and had a dirty effect but the other was perfect. Reason I'm giving 3 stars I paid for two perfect protectors and the quality protection would be for small drops.,3
4816,One of the two screen protectors in the pack was cracked - unsightly!,3
4817,"One of these were fine to put on my phone, but the other one broke straight away, I'm not sure if it was my fault or if it wasn't made very well, hopefully the one on my phone will protect it.",3
4818,One size doesn't fit all. However does block most of the light out which is the main thing.,3
4819,One twin allergic to them.,3
4820,"One was fine, the second didn't have adhesive to the top left corner and didn't stick regardless of cleaning etc",3
4821,One was okay but the other was cracked.The product itself is brilliant but to order two and one be damaged before use. Is not good.It could of been done by deliverers.So no harm done really.,3
4822,Only give it 3 stars as it doesn't fit the full screen which I think it should since all the glass should be protected other than that it's great and quick delivery,3
4823,Only had it 3 weeks and haven't dropped my phone but it is already cracked,3
4824,Only issue is that it doesn't fit the whole screen for my iPhone 6 so it's very noticeable. Other than that I've had no issues with the screen protectors.,3
4825,"Only just used it, so effectiveness still to be tested. Concerned that the sides do not seem to have stuck. Very clear and touch responsive though.",3
4826,Only lasted a couple of months and started peeling away. Normally JETech products last much better.,3

4828,"Only my second time in 30 years of trying an electric razor and after shaving with the Braun Series 3 3040 I know why I stick with a wet razor.The Braun really struggled and got nowhere near a smooth shave, in fact had to go back over my face with my wet razor. I spent about 10 minutes repeatedly going over and over with the braun but couldn't get a decent shave. I'm afraid it's back to my razor for me.",3

4832,"Only used because Naty stopped being on subscribe and save - tried them, didn't really like them. Back to Naty, even without the subscribe and save discount.",3
4833,"Oral-B PRO 6000.  We've used a 5000 series Braun for a couple of years, and have became accustomed to its funny ways, so when Vine offered me this PRO 6000 I thought it would be an improvement (newer, bigger number, more bucks).  And the attraction of the Bluetooth link to the tablet seemed interesting.Sadly, it is a step back from the 5000 unless you have exceptionally sensitive teeth and gums and are prepared to floss after each and every tooth cleaning to complete the operation.The main problem is that it is much more sensitive than the old 5000, and is therefore less good at cleaning our teeth because of not enough pressure to reach into the crevices between the teeth - too much pressure and it stalls and flashes a red light at you.  If you could program the pressure threshold it would not be so bad.I did not bother with the app since the ""Smart Guide"" dongle that comes with it does enough to allow me to control the brush to try all the different modes - I ended up with the standard 'Daily Clean' as being the most effective for the time taken.  I think wasting effort on extra-cost gimmicks requiring yet another device is pointless if the brush is not cleaning well enough in the first place.Charging.  Aaarrgghh!  The supplied 3737 charger (0.4W standby, 0.8W when charging) takes forever.  According to the manual, the blue lights turn off when the battery is full, but after 36 hours of three climbing bright blue bars (showing it was still charging) flashing on my 6000 and lighting up the room I gave up waiting and I just used it anyway.  The second charge after a week of use also went on forever, as did the third.  The new 3737 sit-on charger is a big step backwards from the 3731 sit-inside charger for the 5000 which is filled in just a few hours; so I tried the 6000 in the 3731 (0.35W standby, 2.5W charging) and found it was fully charged (lights off at last) in just a day.  None of my other 'bathroom appliances' (assorted shavers, brushes, etc) take more than a few hours to do a full recharge, and then all have the sense to stop charging so as not to cook the battery.  The 6000 definitely loses a star because of the seriously inadequate 3737 charger.The four brush heads supplied are interesting, and I can see the point of each one.  They are almost the same as those that were supplied with the 5000, the most useful being the 'CrossAction' and 'FlossAction'.  Not supplied, but illustrated in the manual, is a fifth brush head, the 'TriZone' which looks more like a standard toothbrush.  The blurb for each is accurate.  We are now using the CrossAction brush heads with the more effective and less annoying old 5000.Alas, I was disappointed by this machine after it promised so much.  I think it suffers from rampant feature-itis and rather misses the point; forget the whizzy gimmicks, just clean the teeth.  Even my trusty backup of a Reach Interdental used correctly does a better job between the teeth than the 6000.Addendum 30th November 2014I took it on a business trip (leaving the 5000 at home for SWMBO to use), and discovered that the 6000 battery now only lasts for about four cleans before claiming to be empty and needing a day or two on recharge!  It was sitting on the bathroom shelf in the hotel room charging the whole time I stayed there.  I think the bin will soon be welcoming the 6000, and it is only six months old.",3
4834,Ordered as a backup for my 3 year old 304. Lighter and does not give as good a shave as the original. It does have a better charging lead and connection though. A bit disappointing overall,3

4836,"Ordered other pieces and was extremely pleased with them.  Thought these were on the small and light size, but still very pretty. Would definitely order from Pewterhooter for future pieces of jewellery",3
4837,"Ordered the wrong item, I wanted the pop up blind, this will work though as it alters to the size of your window, there is just allot of material and it seems to be allot of faffing around ...",3
4838,"Other reviewers said they couldn't put it down but I found it difficult to pick up!  The story is OK but the action depends on the rather silly choices made by the rather self-obsessed main character, Laura.  Each time she is faced with choice of actions she always takes the obviously wrong choice.  There are a few cleaver twists but I did not find Laura either engaging or credible.  I bought it because I am also an eclipse chaser and was at the Lizard in 1999 (but in a rather nice cottage rather than the festival, and god a spectacular view of the eclipse through a brief break in the clouds).  I was quite close so to where it was supposed to take place so the book was interesting from that point of view.",3
4839,Our first outing with this blind was a disaster.  We were staying with friends who had velux windows but the blind fell of shortly after being attached.It works on normal windows though.  Its fine!,3
4840,"Out of 5, this makes a room a 3 if rating darkness. Which is not bad compared to other products I have tried. The suction pads don't stay on very well, ended up taping the sheet up with masking tape! This helped to make the room even darker but I bet it will ruin the paintwork round the window.....",3
4841,Over descriptive and a bit confusing going back and forwards in time.,3
4842,"Overall a good read, kept me guessing, but maybe it was slightly too long and dragged out just a little bit.",3
4843,Overall pretty good product.  Was easy to apply looks goods.  Although within a couple of weeks I do already have a crack which is slowly starting to spread.  Im not even sure what started the crack.  There is no chip or clear damage.  So overall simlar to most glass screen protectors,3
4844,"Overall this book was reasonably entertaining , but it took me a while to read it as it struggled to hold my attention.",3
4845,Paper trimmer is flimsy. It doesn't cut through 4 papers together let alone 5. Blade hoovers over the paper and pressure is needed in order to cut paper. Over all; the product is alright but not great.,3
4846,"Pardon the pun but let's cut to the chase here.  This shaver does a good job and on the first attempt gave me a noticeably better shave than the 3-year old rotary head Phillips shaver I have used previously.That said this shaver is also noticeably bigger (17 v 14.5 cm), heavier (225 v 175 grm) and noisier (75 v 65 Db) and feels rather clumsy and awkward in the hand in comparison. I'm not at all sure all this is necessary - a bit like the Chelsea Tractor being on the school run rather than being used for proper off-roading!  Maybe you could use this shaver on your lawn?Ergonomically I found the whole thing just felt wrong, including the on/off switch and the wet/dry slider really being the wrong way round for obvious use. When in wet mode the head can be locked in any of 5 positions, whilst in dry mode the head moves freely up and down. The rubber grip round the rear of the shaver helps give a precise hold, but unfortunately this is countered by the slippy shiny black plastic on the front.There is a sideburn and moustache trimmer but at only 2cm is a bit small and I found the fact that it had a slight convex curve meant that it was hard to use with any precision - that is rather important to anyone with valued facial hair!The 9040 comes only with a charging lead, a travel case and a small bottle of lubricant for the foils. There is no stand to hold it upright in the bathroom and, unlike the other Series 9 models, no cleaning station. I have tried to find out if one can be purchased, or indeed if the 9040 will work with one. It appears to have the right connectors but I have yet to hear from Braun about availability. If you want a cleaning station, and I have used one with a previous Braun model and liked the idea of better hygiene, then you would be better going for the models which include one. This unit is easily washable under the tap and can be used wet or dry so some people are possibly not bothered about the cleaning station and happy not to pay for it and leave it virtually unused.In summary, at this kind of price I think most people would be happiest looking elsewhere.Having used this now for a couple of months I am still very pleased with the shave it delivers with no soreness at all. However, if you have facial hair the sideburn and moustache trimmer is really not fit for purpose. The slide-up rather than flick out at an angle design means that it is very awkward to use and very hard to be accurate. I only use it for the odd long hair and use a better trimmer for more important use.",3
4847,Parts to stick onto window are out of shape so it falls down,3
4848,Perfect for when I work night shifts. Little difficult to get every bit to stick to the window but does the job!,3
4849,"Perhaps Sunday Times readers enjoy reading about eclipses but I felt those parts detracted rather than added to the story which concerns a girl who was raped at an eclipse event at the Lizard in Cornwall in 1999, the subsequent trial of the ex-public schoolboy rapist and the effects of the trial on the complainant, the girl who interrupted the rape and her boyfriend/husband and on all their futures.  The surprise near the end provokes rather an ill-considered knee jerk reaction.",3
4850,"Picked this book up via a deal, but regretted its length and drawn out story. However, well written and I did press on to the end, but it was only the acceleration in the last 20% of the book that made it enjoyable.",3

4873,"Pros:  - Very easy to install.  - Does not affect picture quality on most of the screen's surface (however, please see below).  - 3D touch on iPhone 6s works flawlessly.Cons:  - With the edges of iPhone 6s being curved this screen protector does not stick to the entire screen. ~1-2mm on each side are left ""unglued"", which does not look pretty and, more importantly, a bit distorts the picture at the edges. It is nothing major, but it does appear as if there is a shadow along the edges, especially if most of the screen is bright/white (for example, in the Mail app). (Both my wife and I independently installed it on our phones with the same result, suggesting that it was not just me messing things up.)  - It is not fingerprint resistant.",3

4875,"Pros:excellent price for 2 screen protectorsWell sizedCons:Comes with only one set of cleaning materials, and application tools. Should really have two sets, considering this is a pack of two screen protectors. Application tools are a little crude and fiddly.Has a cutout for the front camera - this really isn't necessary in a highly transparent glass screen, and has the side effect of just accumulating dirt within the front camera cut-out, resulting in blurry pictures. Some other screen protectors don't do this e.g. Volt tech.",3

4877,Protects the screen amazingly but ive tried many times and ive never not had an air bubble.,3

4881,"Purchased for my husband for Christmas as he wanted to try an electronic razer but he just can't get in with this. I'm inclined to think it's more the technique than the razer itself as the reviews here are so positive but it seems he just can't get anything resembling a close shave with it. His neck in particular seems difficult, it seems no matter what direction he shaves in it doesn't do much at all. Works slightly better dry than wet but then gets quite hot. I'm sending him off to YouTube to watch some tutorials and will update if he has any better success with it.",3
4882,put screen protector on iPhone and within a few days it had chipped (nothing had happened to the phone.) contacted the supplier and eventually got a replacement. hopefully the first one was faulty and this one will last longer.,3
4883,"quality is good, however air gaps near the edges (length side) are very hard to get rid off.",3
4884,"Quality is just ok, I have used some better, some worse. In two seperate packs I managed to get one that left an odd shadow/bubble underneath.In the second pack, one cracked very crisply when removing the film, Ive done these dozens of times and this one seems to break for no apparent reason other than maybe a weakness in the glass.",3

4887,quite cheap very flimsy... not that hard or sturdy but does the job.,3
4888,Quite flimsy the arm is poorly attached and had to send one back as it was broken. Cutter mechanism not at all sturdy.,3
4889,Quite good.,3
4890,Quite loud,3

4892,"Rated as OK, quite a nice screen and easy to fit, other than there were NO wet and dry cleaning wipes so unless you have a brand new phone your need to purchase some cleaning wipes to. Only dust wipe was included.",3
4893,"Rather creepy and repetitive for my taste. I found all that jumping about rather confusing and really why not tell the story chronologically. I didn't really think we benefited from that. I did have to know what happenned - but it left me very flat afterwards. Unsavoury story I shouldn't have chosen it. I was fascinated... But basically they were too realistic, everyone flawed, not ONE nice person amongst them !",3
4894,Rather underwhelmed with product. Can be confusing to set up and defiantly not value for money,3
4895,Read the whole book but wasn’t enthralled,3
4896,"Really disappointed... the suckers do not stick to the window very well, when the blind is bunched up to fit to size so i'm constantly reattaching one or two all the time. When the blind does actually hold up, it does provided the black out required. Our nursery window is relatively small (1mx1m) so there's a lot of excess material which is just rolled up on the window ledge.",3
4897,"Really effective brush that does a good job of cleaning teeth. However, the battery life is not good. It is claimed in the packaging it is good for two weeks per charge. So far it lasts 6 days used twice daily for the recommended 2 minutes then dies suddenly. Good job there is a 2 year warranty as I can foresee a claim for battery replacement in the near future. Shame as it is a great device.",3
4898,Really good concept and possibly user error but by the morning half the suction pads have come unstuck and light is flooding through the window but at least I'm getting my toddler to sleep in the evening which is what I needed it for.,3
4899,"Really not worth the money. This is a very pointless gimic. You really don’t need/use most of the features this has built in.I would highly recommend buying an Oral B electric toothbrush but I would look around the £30 mark- they do everything you would use and need from this expensive toothbrush.  The wasted features like extra lights and blue tooth drain the battery and only just lasts just over a week of minimum brushing. To charge this toothbrush fully, no word of a lie. It takes 22hours plus to fully charge. It’s a toothbrush, not a Tesla car!!Needless to say, I wouldn’t buy one again at this price and this complexity.",3
4900,"Really quick delivery, only ordered it last night & got it this afternoon! Very awkward & fiddly to put up which was a bit stressful! Not easy to adjust to the size you want it either. But once we got it up, closed the curtains, turned the light off & shut the door to block out all the light it seems to do the trick! You need to use double sided sticky tape or Velcro to stick it up on the window properly because there were gaps so light was still coming through after only using the suckers to put it up.",3
4901,"Really well designed kit with one caveat.The fit is terrible.This is not the fault of the product, more an issue with the stupid curved glass edge of the iphone 6",3

Very good price but doesn't cut as well as my 3 blade rotary razor, however I knew this before I bought it, what it does give you is a much smoother and comfortable shave which is what I wanted",3
4906,Received on time .  Somewhat flimsy but does the job. Not over excited.,3
4907,received pack of 2 yesterday - couldn't get the film off the first one - but 2nd was great - much easier than applying a film I found.,3
4908,Received product early which was great however the protector does not fully fit the screen and the sides do not seal properly therefore there is trapped air that does not come out no matter how much you press it down the sides continue to have a long line of air streaking down them. Not greatly satisfied as I had to pay £9 in total which meant £4 in getting it delivered. Not too happy as my phone doesn't look nice anymore,3
4909,"Received quick and fitted to my iPhone 6s however it doesn't seem to have sealed to the screen along the side edges it seems that fraction too big to sit within the bevel led edges of the screen, other than that I'd give 5stars and particularly like the blue sticker to aid in dust removal before fitting, shame the edges haven't sealed it would look perfect if they had",3
4910,"Received within good time and definitely blacks out the room however the rubber stricky pads to hold it up don't work it took me three hours to eventually get it to stick, it is not moving now as I can't go through that every time",3
4911,"Recently I bought the excellent Braun Oral-B Professional Care 1000 One-Mode Rechargeable Toothbrush and I am very pleased with it. The opportunity arose to try this model so I took it. I've seen it on sale in the shops and was fascinated by the idea of the digital display but horrified by the price.Firstly, comparing it to the 1000 model it does clean as well but it is heavier and bulkier. It has several cleaning setting and a specific toothbrush head (supplied) for each. The blue led lights on it are quite bright and unnecessary. It uses Bluetooth to communicate up to two toothbrushes to the display unit, which shows which setting the toothbrush is cleaning on and shows which part of your mouth you should be cleaning as the process counts down. At the end you get a smiley face and a star-rating from 1 to 4 (which appears to be solely based upon the time spent).The packaging includes everything required to fix the display, toothbrush holder and brush-heads to the wall for easy storage. Charging completely takes 24 hours and a 3-bar display shows how much it has charged, switching off when complete.Apparently it is also possible to connect the toothbrush via Bluetooth to your 'phone (assuming that has Bluetooth too) but that just didn't interest me enough to try it.I think the idea of showing you how long to brush for and in which quadrant would be interesting for children to learn with but there is the issue of the bulk and weight of it to consider.It does clean well but I prefer the more basic and just as effective 1000 model. This does seem to be an attempt too far to make a toothbrush stand out from the crowd.",3
4912,Replaced a previous Braun Shaver which was over 7 years old.I find this new one does not give a closer shave as the old one and it takes a lot longer.It is however good enough for me as I am retired and do not shave every day.,3
4913,"Replaced my old Oral-B with this. Was expecting better battery life and more consistent strength also when battery is low.performs the same as my quite old Oral-B with a replacement battery. Bluetooth is pretty pointless, maybe contributes to battery being so weak.",3

4921,screen protector is cracked after dropping the phone,3
4922,Screen protector is good and easy to fit.Only criticism would be that it could do with being larger to cover the whole screen area. It sits in from the edge too much which makes it look ill fitting and cheap.,3
4923,Screen protector is just about wide enough for the iPhone 6s screen. I think it would protect better if it was slightly wider,3

4931,Simple and well constructed. However in my Kuga the angles difficult the steering wheel partially obstructs the screen. Not particularly rigid or suitable for my car.,3
4932,"Simple to attach using large suckers, look attractive and is mainly effective. If the suckers were further from the edges the overlap with the frame would be better and they would be completely light tight, as it is they allow a little light round some of the edges. Pack away neatly so idea for travelling.",3
4933,Since I use these for general cleaning i.e. spills and my chinchillas feet and my face these are perfect as they are chemical free and really gentle what I was disappointed about was that these don't seem to be as wet at my other waterwipes that were bought from Boot's they're still okay to use just not as moist and the packaging that the box was in came to me damp thankfully the contents were dry.,3
4934,Size is sometimes everything.  Why do manufacturers insist on making their products smaller and charging the same for them.  In the case of a baby wipe the reduction in size has very practical and negative ramifications.  These wipes are fantastic at the previous size but that is now being spoiled by the reduction in size.  Please stop making these smaller and just charge more for the original size if you need to.,3

I did not get any bubbles or dust caught but that goes with cleaning it well!Biggest point was get it in the right place because once it's started sticking - the only option is to pull it off but it caught dust the second time round - so I used the second one!!I have not dropped this phone yet but I do have a wrap case to lift the screen off the floor if I were to drop it!I have not found any issues with the sensitivity on touch and all seems to work well!",3

4952,"Started off OK, though never brilliant at longer hairs.  Now, after a good few months, it seems to take an age to get a smooth shave.  Thinking of going back to a Remington rotary type - used to get 18 - 24 months out of a set of blades and good with long hairs.",3
4953,"Started off promising, however I found that the suckers (which are very strong) can be torn away from the fabric if you pull too hard - but then maybe I do not know my own strength!",3
4954,"Started off so slow I nearly gave up,I stuck with it but didn't really find it much more than OK.I had to skip a lot of the eclipse stuff as it bored me.The ending was drawn out and I was pretty glad to come to the end.",3
4955,"Starting from the packaging is a very good quality one, protecting the contents.Also the full set, cleaning cloth, dust remover and especially the line up stickers are very handy for the correct positioning of the screen protector prior to application. The screen itself of very good quality and nicely laid out with respect to iPhone screen. My only concern is the oleophobic coating that I am not sure that it is as good as the iPhone's one. It will show in the future.",3
4956,Starts out ok then becomes a bit stupid,3
4957,Stay's charged for a good while but does not cut as cleanly as my old Remmington.,3
4958,Stick together when pulling them out which is both annoying and inconvenient when you’ve got a wiggly baby!,3
4959,Struggled with it in the beginning. Almost lost patience and gave up. It spends such a long time describing the symptoms and avoiding the cause that it gets a bit frustrating. Some parts were gripping but others were boring because it wouldn't get to the point. Finished it though and was satisfied with the ending.,3
4960,Suckers are pretty crap,3
4961,Suckers fall down. Stuck Velcro strips around window and used the Velcro on the blinds and now works a dream.,3
4962,"Suckers not great - keep coming off despite our best attempts,  disappointed & have a very unsettled child still on the light evenings and mornings :(",3
4963,"Suckers not very good, however when you do manage to get it fixed to the window blackout is fantastic",3
4964,Suction could do with being stronger and you have to lean forward when using otherwise u loose milk!,3
4965,Suction cup doesn't stick properly,3
4966,"Suction cups are terrible, when they do stay stuck it’s food at blocking light out.",3
4967,Suction cups aren’t great. Ended up using Velcro to sucure it to the window frame,3
4968,"suction grips dont stay on the window, but the velcro option solves that problem.  great black out blind.",3
4969,"Suction isn't great and some light still gets in around the edge, not impressed for the price",3
4970,"Switched over from Panasonic to Braun, as the Panasonic's display stopped working after 2 years. Compared to my previous shaver, this definitely feels better and smoother.+ve aspects:* Like the cleaning system using the alcohol based solution* auto lubrication of the blades while cleaning* drying system* leather travel pouch-ve aspects:* expensive* display doesn't show the % of charge left, only in bars* cannot use foam or gel if you intend using the cleaning system after shave.  Should manually clean under the tap to thoroughly clean the foam / gel before using the cleaning system.Updated 17 Apr 2016The charging point (one of them) started corroding and hence doesn't charge properly.  Have to try more than once to ensure contact of the charging points. Could be the splashing of the cleaning liquid which corroded the charge point. Anyhow, returning the piece (as it is less than a year)  and placed an order for a new one, as I like the smooth shaving experience.",3
4971,Takes all day to charge but does the job.,3
4972,Tedious after a reasonable start but after a while I didn't really care who had done what or when!,3
4973,The actual black out effect is excellent. Only problem is the sucker pads; some would stick to the window but others wouldn't. Any  ideas of how to overcome the problem?,3
4974,The amazon version sticks better and is better value for money!,3
4975,"The application, although instructions were provided, led to bubbles being underneath the glass. This meant we had to remove it and then it was no longer useful.Quick postage and nicely packaged, shame we couldn't use the product.",3
4976,"The battery charges for a very long time (charging for 12-14 hours is not enough to have it fully charged), and lasts for only 5 days (teeth are brushed twice a day).And this is just after 1.5 month of using it. it's suitable for kids as well as adults and gives clear indications when to go to clean another part of your teeth.The battery is very disappointing though and i would not recommend it to anybody else for this reason. When going on vacation i will not bring it with me, because along with the case i'd have to bring the charger too.It cleans teeth well though:)",3
4977,The battery life is pathetic!!! Keeping something charged all day long is not desirable. My Sonicare is 10 times better in that regard. A little disappointed but it does the job.,3
4978,The best screen protector I've ever had but not a good fit for my 6s as it doesn't cover the whole screen.,3
4979,"The blackout blinds are a good for occasional use, for like when you are travelling.Although large to cover most windows / maybe even patio windows size, smaller windows would let some light through due to needing to fold the sheet to fit.Window suckers can be better and one of them doesn't seem to stick down for long.",3
4980,"The blackout capabilities of the blind are great, nothing can be seen through it. The problem we have is that at least half the suction cups do not hold even after following the instructions given to heat with hot water. I can only think that the suction cups are chosen because they are cheap and not for how well they work. I have seen much better suction cups on other products such as the sun blinds in the car.",3
4981,"The blind works very well for the first few months.After some time using it, the vacs stop working and it keeps falling down.It's okay if you need to use it any now and again but not as a long-term solution.",3
4982,"The book did not hold my attention and I skipped chunks as I felt it was dull in places. The themes and plot were good ideas, twisted ending was the most exciting bit and, had the rest of the book maintained that pace would probably have enjoyed it more. It was an ok read.",3
4983,"The brilliant wireless smart guide is featured on this model as well as Bluetooth technology. On other Oral-B models it is either wireless smart guide or Bluetooth but the Oral-B Pro 6500 comes with both. I am a big fan of the Oral-B app  which has gone though numerous updates to make it much better. When the Oral-B Pro 6500 is connected via Bluetooth to the Oral-B app the advantages are:- A visual brushing timer – reminds you when two minutes are up- Brushing activity and achievements – receive trophies and awards for regularly brushing- Guidance by a dental professional – work with your dentist to come up with customized brushing routinesThe wireless smart guide is also an incredibly useful feature especially if you are not tech savvy and do not want to connect your Oral-B Pro 6500 to your smart phone. The smart guide also gives you a visual timer and rates your brushing based on the amount of time you have been brushing for. Brushing properly with an electric toothbrush for the dentist recommended 2 minutes will improve your oral hygiene and help prevent gum disease and decay.The Oral-B Pro 6500 comes with five cleaning modes, that will be useful for different people:- Daily clean mode which will be used the vast majority of the time- Gum Care mode which gently massages the gum- Sensitive mode a less powerful daily clean mode that is suitable for people suffering from sensitivity- Whitening mode which polishes the teeth to appear whiter (does not really work)- Deep clean mode a longer daily clean mode cycle which lasts for 3 minutes instead of 2.If you find my review helpful then please click helpful button below, as I write clear, concise reviews to help people to make a decision.",3
4984,"The brush is decent, but the Bluetooth monitor is a gimmick. Buy a cheaper model without the monitor and just make sure you brush your teeth for 2 minuets evenly spread around the mouth. Plus, the wife has one of these too and whichever one we uses registers on both monitors in the house so your brushing history is messed up.",3
4985,The brush is great but the app sucks.,3
4986,"The brush is great, but then no better than any of the other Oral-B ones.Travel case is great, and the black colour sets it apart.  The rest of the functions are more of a gimmick, and not worth the extra.  The bluetooth in particular!",3
4987,"The Characters behavior was not believable, but the context and relationships were interesting. It was an easy and enjoyable read.",3
4988,The charger does not fit standard bathroom plugs.,3
4989,"The curtain is really thick and good quality, but like loads of people have said, it just won't stick. I've tried cleaning the window frame, cleaning the suckers, wetting them, drying them, heating them with hot water, heating them with a hair drier. The plastic is just too thick to get a good suction. The only way I can use the curtain is to open the window and then trap it in the window frame. It would be great if the manufacturer rethought the plastic they use for the suckers.",3
4990,The curtain itself is a good quality.  Suction cups are useless.  They are not staying on the window for very long which makes curtain fall down.,3
4991,the curtains do their job well enough blocking outr light completely - when they stay up that is. so far this has only happened once out of a weeks use. The suction cups whilst larger and better quality than most just dont always do the job they are designed for. A great idea for portability and the way the curtains have velcro attached to gather loose material for smaller windows is a nice touch,3
4992,"The cutter is ok but it depends how much you are wanting to use it and how much you want to cut!It says it has a five sheet capacity but really it struggles with three sheets, this is ok for me but would be frustrating if you were wanting to cut lots of sheets at once.The blade doesn't seem sharp enough and has to be pushed down very hard in order for the sheets to cut properly - even if you only have one sheet of paper.The ruler the helpful to see where you need to cut the sheet, however it doesn't have specific markings e.g. if you are wanting to cut A4 down to two A5 sheets it doesn't show you where to line it up - I stuck some tape so I know where to put the paper.Overall the product is fine but I think you get what you pay for. If you're going to be using it a lot or want to cut many sheets at once I would recommend spending a little more money and getting something higher quality.",3
4993,"The electronic gadget is not working properly (well not at all, I can see some shades on the screen but I can't use it), hence the 3 stars. The toothbrush itself is excellent.",3
4994,"The fabric is great at keeping out the light, however the suction cups do not hold very well. I needed to take the blind down everyday to let light into the room, so the suction cups weren't efficient. I removed them and placed command hooks above the window and hung the blind via the eyelets. so much easier now.",3
4995,"The foil is very smooth and doesn't catch on the skin. Appears to work fine either as a dry shave or in the shower, and is easy enough to remove the foil and clean.The 1 hour charge seems to give a weeks worth of shaving, so that's perfectly fine.The 3 day beard thing didn't work for me though, it struggled on anything after a couple of days. And didn't really work on my neck, leaving a number of hairs longer than the rest of them no matter how many times or from what angle I tried.This is a good enough shaver for daily use, but don't expect miracles after a couple of days - you will probably just have to wet shave.",3
4996,The glass had some imprefections upon opening. A few scratches and whatnot. Its good its a pack of two though. Still... could be much better.,3
4997,"The glass screen functions as it should. However this is not a good fit for iPhone 6s. It could be wider. Also, after two days of putting it on, the bottom corner of the protector cracked without me dropping the phone so I am rather confused. The touch sensitivity and clarity is great compared to plastic protectors. Probably better if used on Samsung phones where screen is also glass.. Will not be much benefit for iPhone",3
4998,"The good: - It is your usual oral-b toothbrushThe bad: - Battery charging for ~24hrs (there is no other way of putting it, than, ""F^%king disgrace"") - Wireless smart guide is only good if you have a shelf at or around top of your chest level, as it is looking slightly downwards as it is hard to see what's on display if it is set on the sink (I'm 182cm tall [below 6ft], so it's not my height that's an issue) - battery is STILL not replaceableIf you are looking to buy an electric toothbrush, check out cheaper models, as bluetooth smart guide and Oral-b's mobile app are both useless (smart guide works as a waterproof clock in my bathroom, that is its only redeeming feature).Alternatively, wait for another occasion this goes on sale for £65 (""Black Friday""), maybe closer to christmas.Long story:Overall, this is yet another step backwards from the Triumph 5000 design they had about 4 years ago (not the one available now, but one model before). The old model was charging in 8-12hrs, it's smart guide was looking slightly upwards when placed on a level surface (it is not compatible with this model, unfortunately).And don't even get me started on the battery - this is the only thing that WILL fail you once you purchase this product. Braun (Oral-b) made it so that they can force you to buy a new product every ~2 years. That was when my old Triumph's battery failed and I used a replacement (process was not the easiest, but doable. Extended the life of toothbrush for another ~18 months). With this model, I'm not yet sure, I am yet to take it apart, but it's brand new so you might have to wait a while ;)I'm expecting this to be my last Braun toothbrush, unless they improve charging time and/or add replaceable batteries.",3
4999,"The Gro Blackout blind is really handy to use temporarily, but the Velcro tabs to shorten the blind don't work too well, it all ends up hanging everywhere really, and the suctions are quite difficult to put on/keep on. It does let a fair amount of light through as well... only good in a temporary situation, but still pretty good.",3
5000,The item was ok.,3
5001,The jury is out on these  covers - they break easily on the kids phones and don't seem to fit very well. The one for my Android is fine but that fits and is probably better looked after.,3
5002,The labels are all worn out and scrunched up as if washed previously. Suction plugs don't all hold in place despite cleaning any dust and moistening the plugs for better suction.Nonetheless onece taped onto the window frame it certainly blacked out the light!,3
5003,"The look of blind is wonderful, but trying to get it to stick onto the window is a nightmare and sometimes impossible.  I have cleaned window as suggested.  Great idea, but I think I may have wasted my money, very sad",3
5004,"The material and pattern are good, but the suction cups are far too big.In typical suction cup fashion they need to be adhered to a perfectly flat surface, so unless you stick it to the glass they just fall off.I ended up putting some stick on hooks on the window frame and cutting holes in the material to attach it.",3
5005,"the minimalist design is a great idea, however its a bit too minimalist as its impossible to fully cover the edges of the touch screen. if the protector was just 1mm wider then it would've covered the little bit of screen sticking out",3
5006,"The motor part of my pump stopped working when connected to the mains supply after only 3 months, while it works with batteries it goes through them fast! im now trying to figure out how to get it exchanged or fixed through Amazon...in the meantime I've borrowed a medela pump which is much faster at expressing. The Lansinoh model was comfortable to use and less noisy than the medela however the broken motor is a major inconvenience",3
5007,The only razor I can get on with,3
5008,The only wipes we have used that doesnt give our little one nappy rash.  Easier to use than cotton wool and water.The packaging is poor because to re-seal it you have to use a clear sticky plastic seal instead of a better made plastic closer thats available on other similar products.,3
5009,"The overall storyline did a good job of keeping me wanting to read as right until the end it surprised me/had me guessing. The writing style however was harder to stick with, I found it slow going and considering the plot, easy to put down",3
5010,"The package was received with only one screen protector inside when there should have been two.  The protector itself is easy to fit, although it doesn't g to the edges therefore standing out on the phone, it does the job for the majority of the phone screen.",3
5011,"The packaging is very poorly designed, you can never take out a single wipe and the closure is not great. However is the only water wipes available out there (as far as I know) and once you win the fight to take them out they do the job",3
5012,"The pad has a good screen and sound and of course has a years subscription to lots of stuff. However, there's quite a lot of really good android software not available for this, and it is rather difficult for parents to control exactly what your children have access to. Some of the ""educational"" content doesn't seem especially well chosen to me. Annoyingly, I have not been able to find a list of the freely available books for the system. You seem to have to just trust to whatever amazon has selected, and of course not all of it is of the highest quality.I am not as impressed with the parental controls as I expected to be. I can just decide educational goals in terms of minute. I can't easily screen off particular apps.It's OK but I'm not sure I'd buy it again. Some of the free content makes up for the frustrations, but a little more personalized control would go a long way.Still if you want access to the content and something that is easy to control and are not very tech literate this might work for you. It is also a good price of course, although at some point the subscription will run out and you will have to start paying.",3
5013,"The photo fooled me, I thought it was a bit bigger",3
5014,The plot is ok but wow did it take long to get to the point! It's a story that's a little bit far fetched but hey we live in a weird & wonderful world so I guess anything is possible. It's a long book which didn't help with pages & pages just going on about nothing. I suppose it got a little bit better about 80% into the story & finally brought in some twists & turns. Nearly gave up a handful of times but glad I finally read it to the end. Still can't understand what all the hype is about the book but must admit that the writing is good & the author comes out with some brilliant lines.,3
5015,"The plot went on a bit in an unessesary way. There were  twists in the story, but not much plot. Who is telling the truth in a rape trial? Who to believe?  To my mind too many sub plots were introduced. I did finish it, but for me it's forgettable.",3
5016,"The price went down £60 not long after I brought it. And the shaver only does the job, like others that cost around 50.",3
5017,The product is fine. Far too much polystyrene in the packaging.,3
5018,"The product is okay and certainly better than my previous electric razor.  It is fine if just used to shorten facial hair (2-3 days growth) before having a 'proper' wet shave.  However, it leaves some of the coarser hairs behind, which is why I would never use this razor by itself, in lieu of a proper shave. I can use it as a 'top up' shave, but only if I have 1/2-3/4 day's worth of growth.",3
5019,The quality is fantastic but the size is not great it doesn't fit the full screen and it doesn't cover the camera there is a hole left for it which we think is wrong as it should cover it to protect it.,3
5020,"The quality of the fabric is fine and blocks light well, however, the suction cups are not great and are of varying quality with some sticking great and others not.",3
5021,"The razor is fine.  Is not my primary razor - I use it as a back up for those moments when you need a quick shave, or to refresh for the evening.  My only disappointment is that it does not come with a case; and so inevitably, the razor and the brush and the charger cable all end up in different places.  This is the first Braun razor I have ever bought (and I have several, rating them highly) that has come without a case.",3
5022,"The screen does fit, however it stops just before the curves (although, granted, most iPhone 6/6s screen protectors don't cover the whole screen). It's quite thin, and smudges easily (the actual screen protector) - but it does its job. I'm quite in the middle with this product, it's okay, but it's not the best.",3
5023,"The screen protector feels sturdy and cool to the touch, much better than any plastic film. However the installation process is not the easiest, and I ended up with a tiny crack on the upper bit of the sheet. Also, it's supposed to be oleophobic but fingerprints do remain visible, much more so than on the iPhone's screen.It still is a good way to protect the screen, and getting two at such a good price is very convenient.",3
5024,"The sensitivity sensor broke during my second use of this item. I can still use it, but it makes the special extras that come with this pack pointless.I would keep this in mind when looking at buying this product, as the difference between this and just getting the brush is the little sensitivity helper thing.",3
5025,"The shaver itself is excellent; in fact it shaves much better than I expected it would.However, my disappointment with the product stems from the two pin charger not being compatible with either my shaver point or, as I recently discovered, with Spanish power sockets. I wasn't too bothered that it wouldn't connect to my home shaver socket as I seldom use, it preferring to utilise an adapter to make two pin fit a UK three pin socket. The Braun two pins fitted my adapter without problem. But when I recently visited Spain I discovered that the two pins would not fit into the power socket, so I was unable to charge the shaver. When I returned from Spain I compared the Braun two pins with adapters in my Apple World Travel Adapter Kit and deduced that the Braun two pins were compatible with the Korean system; that's why it won't fit.To use the product in Europe, in the future, I will take both my UK three pin and three pin to continental two pin adapters.",3
5026,The shaver itself is well built and packaging is good however it is not fully charging even after leaving it more than 4 hours.I have been using it for a week now but I am concerned with the battery not fully charging,3
5027,"The shower proof aspect of this excellent. However, you always have to go over again two or three times. Constantly leaves hair behind, have had to resort to a blade a couple of times to get the left overs.",3
5028,The suckers on this make it very difficult to keep all the light out. No matter what way i stick this on some light manages to seep through. I also had some problem getting the suckers to stay on the window which is why i only gave 3 stars,3
5029,The suction caps are quite poor and always fall off. Although when they do stick on window the room is completely blacked out,3
5030,"The suction caps seems to come off unless you really smoosh them onto the window, which leaves marks. The blind is also quite big and heavy, so hard to use on smaller windows. Good for travelling, but if you want to use it in the same room repeatedly I would go for something else.",3
5031,The suction cups are of very poor quality! They don’t hold on for long !!,3
5032,The suction pads are really bad as they do not stick properly onto the window it keeps falling and my daughter kept screaming every time scared from the noise of falling curtains. For the pads that are stuck it's a nightmare to remove them and in the long term they get ruined. I found a solution is to put them between the window and the shutter so that no need to use the pads. Other than that happy with the darkness they provide we have been able to put our daughter's routine back,3
5033,"The timer is good, the brush cleans well and the included heads is a bonus. But the bluetooth is useless. I can't fathom why anyone would think this would be a useful feature. The app (on android at least) is terrible and clunky. I think perhaps going for a lesser model would be the best option.",3
5034,"The toothbrush is Ok, but the charge only last a week, and that is using it once a day.",3
5035,"The toothbrush is pretty good, but the donwside for me would be battery life. I've read that the average battery life is approx a week, but mine seems to be finished after 3 days even after full charge... Not sure if it's just my product, but a little annoying!",3
5036,The toothbrush is very good battery life only 2 days nothing like advertised and will not tell you you are about to run out!!! A bit of a disappointment ! As advertised should last for a whole ten days  is there a chance it can be swapped for another one?,3
5037,The toothbrush itself is excellent device. It is doing its job.I rate it with 3 stars only for one thing: in my region (Cyprus) there is no application for android phone. And I really don't understand why. Since I am not in UK or US I simply cannot download it in app store as it is not visible...,3
5038,The toothbrush itself works a treat- I know its quite gimmicky having the Bluetooth display but it has genuinely helped me concentrate on the areas to brush of my incisor’s/ molar’s. Bravo Oral B in educating me on effective oral hygiene.The poor point is the battery power. I switched from Sonicare that would last for a good 2-3 weeks on a full charge. This electronic molar cleaner gives me about 5-6 days on full charge (which can take up to 24 hours of electricity sapping juice). Genuinely pitiful. It means if I ever go away I need to enquire with the hotel that they have the required 230V sockets which with a degree of inevitability is only afforded to the high end hotel chains. This means I am now forced to stay in 5 star luxury costing me in excess of £200 per night all for my oral hygiene. The brush works a treat other than that. I have to award it a mid point score for that reason.,3
5039,"The toothbrush itself works well enough but the plethora of different heads is probably a pointless and confusing gimmick and perhaps the difference in performance between them is minimal and bare contributes to the claimed different 'focus' goals....  the bluetooth connectivity and the L:CD timer thing I never set up - it too seems unnecessary. I know what two minutes is - I don't need my phone or a timer to tell me if I've brushed long enough or whether I remembered to brush my teeth.  As I didn't install the app, I do not know what permissions it needs (e.g. phone book, camera, contacts, id) or what information it might send back to Oral-B.  So, at full price, this whole system is poor value.  When it's on special @ £65, it's fine, but I would ignore the 'connectivity' features.  n.b. When using, it beeps and the motor pulses every so often... I think that's to tell you each 30 seconds, it's not a fault (I didn't bother reading the manual(), so you do get some timing features without the LCD/phone setup.",3
5040,The warranty leaflet has some basic info on what the different brush heads are but there's no info on how these should be used/brushing style/techniques. I am unsure where I can find any information.,3
5041,The waterwipes are great and are the only thing that doesn't bring my babies sensitive skin out in a rash. However in terms of the item coming from Amazon...these are not cheap!!! please do not buy from here. It's 2.40 per pack and it makes it sound cheaper saying 0.04 per sheet. Boots sell these at £16.00 for 9 packs. That works out at 1.80 per pack. Much better value,3
5042,"The Waterwipes are perfect, but the box arrived all wet and damaged.",3
5043,"The wettest wipes I have used, which is great, but I do need a dry tissue to dry my little one's bum afterwards, But it is rarely possible to pull one out at a time which can be infuriating, so I have to mark it down, yet still be number 1 choice of wipe for my boy.",3
5044,The window suction cups are of poor quality and often don't stick or come undone.,3
5045,"The wipes are great, but 2 stars lost due to the packaging. The sticky door/flap loses its stick very quickly so the wipes start to dry out. Also the wipes are not stacked so that they pull each other out. You have to hunt around in the pack to find the edge of EVERY wipe.Use Huggies Pure instead, significantly better frustration-free packaging.",3
5046,There are birthdays in December as well as Christmas. That is why I paid for express delivery. This was one day late.  I don't know what was inside the box of the toothbrush etc..........as it was a present and was immediately sent on its way.,3
5047,"There seems to be more electric toothbrushes on the market than ever before, with new models being released almost on a daily basic.The concept of oral hygiene seems to be getting taking to the extreme these days with brushes (like this Oral-B Pro 6000) coming with features like Bluetooth technology and a data application that you can program and that can communicate back to you. These features (to myself at least) seem counterproductive and basically detract from the purpose of a toothbrush (would you really want your mobile phone on your sink while brushing your teeth? running the risk of getting it wet or covered in toothpaste?)Call me a old fashioned but a tooth brush is for cleaning your teeth and in that aspect this Oral B 6000 is pretty good giving you a good deep clean with various modes and settings to play with. However can this REALLY justify an market guide price of £229.99, personally I would say its poor value for money as much cheaper models (including some of Oral-B's own) can leave your teeth (and bank balance) smiling by offering an equally good clean.Personally I would recommend the ""Oral-B Pro 4000 Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush"" which is cheaper comes with less stupid gimmicks and receives better reviews. I'm just wondering what Oral-B will include in their next brush? Perhaps the ability to control your toothbrush by remote control?",3
5048,"These are a good idea especially when you have teenager who are prone to breaking their phones.  My daughter has already cracked her screen protector but thankfully with it on she managed to save her phone, this time at least.  Unlike the last time.",3
5049,These are good but they drive me insane! I have to prepare 5 or 6 prior to changing her nappy because one wipe doesn't pull the other and you have to dig into the packet to get the next one. It's really a shame and they should get this sorted. For that reason alone I will not be re-ordering.,3
5050,"These are good but they seem to start to crack early on even when I haven't dropped or bumped it. The most recent cracked only a day after I had put it on when I had been on a long phone call. Then cracks are fine so hardly noticeable but would like the, to last longer between replacing. Will try a different band next time.",3
5051,These are great but they don't seem to stay stuck to the window very well . They are huge ! But do block out all light.,3
5052,These are not the usual size water wipes- they are much smaller and having read up that means they must be old stock as even in the description of thr product itself on Amazon it refers to the fact that they were made bigger in recent times. Really annoying that they are advertised as being the normal ones and now I have a tonne of them!,3
5053,These are pretty earrings but much smaller than I thought they would be.,3
5054,"These are the best baby wipes on the market in my opinion. My son has a really sensitive skin and had  eczema, never had a problem since using these wipes. Although I only give 3 stars as the product has changed since the first time I've bought them. There is only 60 in the packets now instead of the 72 it used to be and the size of the wipes are a lot smaller now.They are really expensive for what they are but I have to admit they're great for babies skin.",3
5055,These do protect your screen well but have bought a couple of times as they have themselves cracked easily...better than my screen cracking though...,3
5056,"These have changed quite dramatically and suddenly over the last few months. They are a different product and this has been disappointing.Pros of new style Waterwipes -+ Much thicker than they were so they don't come to pieces when you pull them out of the pack in a hurry+ Very slightly cheaperCons -- Much less moist; so rougher and harder to use on mucky bottoms- No longer biodegradableThe drop in wetness is not a huge problem for us as we only use them for cleaning our little boy's hands and face, for which these are still adequate. When I have, on occasion, used them for his bottom the difference between these and the old type wipes is really noticable though.The main problem for us is that when we started buying baby wipes we made a conscious decision to only use biodegradable products, even though they do cost a little more. the change here puts us in a bit of an ethical dilemma.  Unfortunately there is no comparable product on the market. All other types, even eco friendly wipes contain all sorts of preservatives, lotions, perfumes etc... So if you want a pure wipe it's either these or cotton wool and water.I think we will continue to use these wipes. Although I really hope another company releases something similar to the old waterwipes and then we will switch, even if they are a little more expensive.",3
5057,"These have not been great  A bowl of water and a towelling face cloth works to clean area, but these don't.  I think it's because the towelling has 'fingers' that work to remove whatever is stuck to skin, and these are smooth.What I have found successful, is to use a regular wipe to do the cleaning, and then clean off any residue from the baby wipe with one of these.",3
5058,"These wipes are fantastic for delicate newborn skin however, I find it difficult to get one wipe out at a time, especially towards the end of the pack. Also they are really wet and leave the skin wet and therefore you need to dry baby after using these wipes. I used them for reassurance of not putting any chemicals on newborn baby's skin and as an alternative to cotton wool and water. I switched to other wipes (johnsons) as my children got older.",3
5059,"These wipes are ok, used when i first had my little girl. Wouldn't buy again though, quite thin and lots needed if messy! Think there is just as good wipes, if not better, to buy from the shops.",3
5060,These wipes are smaller versions of the usual  waterwipes. Not sure if I received from a faulty batch. Quite disappointed to be honest. Would pay that extra 50p for the wider wipes from boots.,3
5061,"These wipes have one big disadvantage. The wipes are not pulling each other out. So each time you want to use it you must loose at least 10 seconds to catch it using your nail. Another disadvantage is that are too strong and they tend not to clean so well. And third, the price for it is way too big for ccepting all above bugs. If you want to clean your baby you will need a lot of patience to pull them out.",3
5062,"They 2 min timer on clock doesnt work, why?",3
5063,"They are ok for their price. They clean, but when you pick one from the box...ten follow altogether...so not practical when u r changing ur baby with one hand... However I may buy them again.",3
5064,They are okay but not really good.,3
5065,They are so small I like them but should be more bigger even if I had to pay little more.,3
5066,They are the same as they weee advertised,3
5067,They are very reliable on saving your screen. Only drama is they don't fit the screen 100%.,3
5068,"They could be a tad bigger, you get at least 3mm short in the length, width is quite ok.",3
5069,They do the job and do so without leaving a rash behind.,3
5070,They do the job of protecting the majority of the screen and the installation process was so easy compared to screen protectors i've used in the past. My issue is that where the iphone screen curves down at the edges the screen protector doesn't quite fit them so you have a very small thin bubble at the edges where the screen protector doesn't quite make contact with the screen. A bit of a shame as the ease of installation was so good!,3
5071,they just crack every 2 weeks.,3
5072,"They should make a smaller one. Even with all the velcro it doesnt fit my window, there are loads of gaps around the edges.",3
5073,"Thicker than standard plastic, covers the whole screen as described time will tell how good it stands up .I recommend when putting this on to have your phone unlocked otherwise it's too easy to misalign and not cover screen fully.

5074,"This book begins in 1999 in Cornwall whilst Laura and Kit are there to watch the eclipse, Laura sees what she believes to be a rape.  Skip to 2015 where they have changed their names after the rape trial.I found this quite slow especially at the beginning, though the twists and turns improved the pace later on.  I didn't particularly like/care for the main characters either.Having said this I will read more by Erin Kelly in the future.Thank you to NetGalley and the publishers Bidder & Stoughton for letting me read this in exchange for an honest review.",3
5075,"This book does have a twist that I genuinely did not see coming, which is its main strength. However, it is quite slow to start and the underlying premise is a little far-fetched. While reading it, I couldn't believe that the characters would take the fairly extreme steps that they did.",3
5076,"This book follows one couple, Laura and Kit and shows how one eclipse changed the course of their lives.Cornwall 1999 and Laura and Kit are there for the eclipse but Laura stumbles across a couple having sex.Is it rough consensual sex or is it rape?That is the question but what's the answer?The woman face down in the dirt is Beth who looks traumatised and Laura comes to the conclusion it's rape. This event shapes the next fifteen years of their lives.There's a lot of twists and turns in this book so I'm not going to say anymore for fear of giving something away.This was a different read for me I generally stick to romance but the blurb intrigued me so much I had to give this a go.Initially I found it difficult to get into, it seemed slow and I was struggling and skimming and if I'm being totally honest I only continued on because I'd requested this and felt I needed to write a review otherwise I would have quit.I did however continue on and the book picked up pace and nothing and no one was quite as they seemed. I found the second half of the book to be a much quicker read but at times it felt a little too much had been thrown in there. I know, I know there's no pleasing some people.My main problem was I didn't particularly like any of the characters the one I did think I liked turned out to be......okay I'm not spoiling this so we'll stick with me not liking the characters.This could just be me or a result of the fact that I usually read romance but I need to like at least one of them or it doesn't work for me.I can understand the great reviews this book has received, it's clever and interesting but for me the first part was too slow and I didn't like the characters so I'm sorry I can't give more than 3*.I voluntarily read a review copy kindly provided by NetGalley and Hodder & Stoughton",3
5077,This book was a good read on the whole but found the middle was getting  little tedious and almost stopped reading it. However was pleased I finished it and found the last section of the book very good.,3
5078,This curtain is great for blocking out light when it stays in place. It did take me multiple attempts to get the suckers to stay on the window which was a little frustrating but once I got them attached the majority stayed in place.The Velcro feature is helpful and allows you to bunch any excess material so that the curtain hangs better.A useful product but the weight of the material can make it tricky to hang.,3

5080,"This holder has good and bad points, overall I'm pretty happy with it.Pros:Small and discreetAttaches to vent easily and feels secureCons:Although well attached to the vent (as in it doesn't look like it will fall out) it's not very stable so the phone is wobbling around as you drive which is pretty annoying.Not bad but wouldn't buy again",3
5081,"This is a good shaver, but I was a little underwhelmed for the price.The unit itself is very nice, has a good weight to it and feels very comfortable in the hand. It also comes in a semi-hard case which again looks pretty neat and feels like it will protect the shaver if rattling around in a suitcase.Shaving I have found to be mixed. For hair on my chin,cheeks and lip I find it works brilliantly. It works best when moving the shaver against the grain of the hair, so moving it straight up here gets good results. I tend to leave my shaving to once a week, so by the time I do come to shave there is a fair amount of growth. Not only did the Braun shave it all off quite quickly, but it did so without any of the pinching I have experienced with other shavers.My problem with the shaver is when using it on my neck. Here my hair doesn't grow uniformly so moving the shaver against the grain is a little more difficult. When the shaver is not moved against the grain it really doesn't do a good job at removing hair at all. What this meant was I had to run the shaver over my neck in every direction to make sure all the hair was cut. This not only took a long time, but the constant shaving left my skin irritated. I get this a little with my old rotary shaver, but not this bad.My other complaint with the shaver is the pop-out clipper. I use this to get a nice clean line where my sideburns end. With the Braun, the pop-out clipper doesn't really feel like it's doing much cutting. Looking at the cutting surface it looks like the two sets of ""blades"" are aligned in a way that the moving part will never be that close to your skin. Great for avoiding cutting yourself, not so good for getting a clean cut. What this meant was I had to try and get a clean shaved line with the main shaver head.Positives:+ Feels comfortable to hold+ Very solid feel to it+ Nice travel pouch+ Great with longer hair (painless!)+ When it cuts you get a close shaveNegatives:- Not so good at tackling hair that isn't growing uniformly- Pop-out trimmer is poor at cuttingOverall:It's a good shaver, but quite underwhelming for the price. What it has over my old rotary shaver in terms of cutting ability, it loses again with the inability to do much when you're not moving against the grain, and therefore the irritation it causes",3
5082,This is a great product in that's the purest and safest wipe on the market. Who wants to smear their baby's skin with a bunch of synthetic chemicals you can't even pronounce?!The 2 missing stars from my review are for the fact that they changed the wipes so they are no longer biodegradable.So now I'm not contaminating my baby's skin with chemicals but I'm contaminating the planet with waste that will not break down. That doesn't make me feel good and looks to me like this company is putting profit before ethics.,3
5083,"This is a great shaver. Nice and sharp and no razor burn. 3 stars because the trimmer is awful - its cheaply made, feels fragile and not that good at cutting because it is a weak part. Make the trimmer better and this would be 5 stars.",3
5084,"This is a really good device and is easy to set up. It allows really good management of access to content and apps. What is sadly lacking and quite unbelievable though is the blatant absence of a music player within the profile for kids!  Amazon appear to block all apps from accessing downloaded music and there is no access to stream it either. Same goes for access to audio books. Shame on you Amazon. If music was available this would get 5 stars, but this clear misunderstanding of what their customers want and what kids enjoy demonstrates Amazon's lack of basic customer engagement in this area. I'm not against amazon, I feel they offer a good service on most other occasions but they have really let themselves down on this occasion. Amazon, please also include in your product description an advisory to parents that music and audio books are not accessible in kids profiles. This would at least go some way to demonstrating an honest approach. An update to include music would be as great improvement. As it is, I am very pleased with the rest that kindle for kids offers and would recommend it to others parents as long as they are aware of the above missing basic essentials .",3
5085,"This is a very expensive toothbrush, with a lot of added extras which really don't seem to add much to the teeth cleaning experience, to be honest. I've used a Philips Sonicare for the last few years, and it is much, much better than the Braun in every respect.I did manage to both download the app for this and set up the Bluetooth, but it took a long time to get it to connect to my Iphone. I did use it once, but it was completely pointless and taking up space on the phone, so I deleted it. It also wanted access to the microphone on the phone so that it could hear the toothbrush being switched on. I couldn't really see what use that would be, especially as it is already using Bluetooth for this.The toothbrush comes with a small digital clock type thing, which shows you how much time you have been brushing for, and which mode of brushing you are using. It also has a face icon which smiles when you have been brushing for the required amount of time.It takes ages to charge, and I was very surprised at how quickly the charge ran out. My Philips Sonicare charge lasts for about three weeks, but this lasted less than a week. The Sonicare is quite quiet and smooth, whereas this sounds quite loud and mechanical. The brush head is much larger than the Sonicare too, and did not seem to be able to clean the very back teeth completely, as it did not fit into the space very well.I was quite pleased with the results this toothbrush gave, but the inconvenience of the charging issues made it quite annoying. The Bluetooth, the app and the little clock must all add to the cost of this, and really they are all pretty superfluous. I have had a cheaper Braun toothbrush in the past, and the actual brushing bit isn't an awful lot different to that, but the price certainly is.",3
5086,"This is an excellent toothbrush in that it has great power and the charge lasts for days - useful when you don't have a shaver socket in the bathroom and have a plug charger set up elsewhere. I also particularly like the light that comes on when you brush too hard. I didn't realise I pressed down so hard and the brush is helping me to change that.What lets it down is the horrible intrusive app. They've got it very wrong with this for people like me who are protective of their privacy and don't need a toothbrush to know their contacts or location. I don't bother with the app and feel that they haven't made good use of their R&D with the app part of this product. I'm sure a hefty chunk of the retail price is due to the app.Overall I like this toothbrush. It lasts for ages on one charge and does encourage better brushing. Rather than the app, all you need is a plaque disclosing tablet once or twice a month to keep you on the straight and narrow, My teeth do seem brighter but don't know if that's due to the whitening ability they claim or to my toothpaste (Oral B Whitening) or both.I'd give this toothbrush 5 stars if it didn't have the pointless app and therefore was more reasonably priced. I'm really not sure how many people are that bothered about connecting a toothbrush to their phone. Perhaps if you've got a temporary dental issue and need help monitoring your brushing habits.",3
5087,This is an interesting read but a 'suspense thriller' it is not.,3
5088,"This is an odd shaver, it’s priced at the premium end of the market, but it doesn’t feel that way. The box is okay but nothing fancy and the actual shaver feels like it’s made of cheap plastic. It comes with a power adaptor and lead, small bottle of oil, and a brush. There is a carry case supplied which is useful for when travelling with the shaver. There is also a small manual which is in a couple of different languages and couple of different models. Not really that helpful, but it’s easy enough to just pick up the shaver and use it.It’s average for daily shaving as I found I had to go over areas of my face several times to get bits of stubble that had been missed. I found that with longer hair growth it was better and got more of the hair but then had to go over the shorter areas again. The trimmers are okay but needs a couple of goes to get a straight cut.One of the good points is that this can be used in the shower without any issues and tends to give a slightly better shave under running water. It’s also good to be able to run it under a tap to get any bits of hair out if dry shaving.Charges quickly – in about an hour and you get a similar time in use. There is a small LED that quickly shows you the charge.It’s okay, and it gives a decent shave after a few repeats but at the price it’s not something that is recommended.",3
5089,"This is average. It's a good idea but unfortunately, each time I've used it the auction pads don't work. Every time I've gone in to check on my little one the thing is hanging off the window, so it defeats the object really.",3
5090,"This is just not powerful enough, takes ages to shave with it and does not provide very close shave. Sent it back and bought the Series 9 instead, much much better",3
5091,"this is my fault, didnt really check the sizing, much smaller than i expected. pic is a bit deceiving, Will be more careful at reading product description in future",3
5092,"This is my first electric razor and while the build is good and in general it is a very good shaver unfortunately for me it just doesn't compare to a wet shave, it doesn't get all the hair especially on my neck.Maybe its just because I have quite coarse hair or the hair on my neck is quite flat but still, razors have no problem.I'll be using this as a body shaver or if I'm feeling lazy and don't mind not being completely clean shaved.I've given it 3 stars because despite my issues with it, it is a quality built item",3
5093,"This is my first Shaver (usually I trim, or wet shave) and my first shaver/trimmer from Braun (I usually opt for Phillips).The problem I expected to encounter as I have thick, strong facial hair was that the process with this shaver would prove both uncomfortable and unproductive. Unfortunately this was my experience...the results were patchy at best. The Shaver tugged the hair, didn't shave closely enough (for my liking anyway) and this meant I spent more time with the task of shaving which supposedly this product should have reduced.However I'm conscious that my experience is maybe not reflective of the product and shouldn't deter buyers. For those with softer facial hair this may well prove miraculous.The lack of additional accessories for me was not unexpected...real consideration in the complete package that takes into account the possibility of travel and presentation in the charging process (in this price range anyway) is just not factored in by manufacturers nowadays. A docking unit and travel case would have been welcome, but you need to pay more to get those kinds of extras.In summary: can't say it worked for me, but may well work for some.",3
5094,"This is my second one, the first one had to be replaced when the batteries died. This looks to be the same type so probably only 2 years use to be had.I was interested in the Bluetooth facility but when I downloaded the app it requested permission to have access to the phones microphone.I asked the app provider why microphone permission was required but they never answered.Strange.",3
5095,this is my second order and they have changed dramatically from my first order wch is a shame but wouldnt compare them with other wipes on the markert.will keep using them untill i find something better than them,3
5096,"This is not a 100% blackout, it stops 85 or 90% of the light, and come in a little of the light. If you want a real blackout curtains don't buy this one. I am happy when all the room is in darkness but I can't get this situation with this curtain",3
5097,This is ok for occasional use but I wouldn't recommend for every day because the suckers take ages to get stuck down which can be very frustrating when you have a child to put to bed!,3

5099,"This is okay. I read it on the kindle, so like others mentioned it can be hard to keep track of the timeline. The problem for me were the characters.  I just didn't get on with them. They were rather dull and 2 dimensional (instead try Eleanor Oliphant is doing fine - much better read in my opinion). So it passed the time, but I won't be re-reading this.",3
5100,"This is super handy while away, but it's staying power with the suckers is somewhat less than ideal in hotter, humid weather and it's a right fuss getting it up by yourself!",3
5101,"This is the 3rd electric toothbrush from this range I've had over the last 10 years, and in all honesty this one has the most pointless additions to it of all of them.The brush itself is the same standard shape and model as all the other Oral-B electric toothbrushes I've used. It comes pre-packed with the same 3 basic heads on the same stand/head storage unit.As with previous models, it doesn't come with a standard mains adapter (it is fitted with a shaver two pin adapter) so you'd better have or get a shaver-to-mains adapter.The brush storage box is slightly better, this time being made of an smoked plastic that is slightly better constructed than some of it's predecessors. But as before the brush will pretty much live on the charger as the battery seems to take all day to charge and you only get a few full uses before the battery gives up.The real additions to this one is the all-singing-all-dancing bluetooth (ha-ha...wonder if they spotted that pun) functionality for both smartphone and bathroom display unit.My Blackberry is apparently woefully inadequate to use the app so I haven't been able to test the functionality of that, but the bathroom display is a little wireless (AA battery powered...and it came with two very nice Duracell batteries for the job) clock and brushing method monitor. The smiley face with the quadrants surrounding it acts as a brushing monitor. The smiley face will become a sad face if you are applying too much pressure, while the quadrants of the circle act as a timer guide for how long to brush each part of your mouth. At the end of the cycle you are treated to a primary school style star rating on the effectiveness of your brushing.In all honesty - I've had enough of these gimmicks and went very quickly back to my manual brush and only use the display as a handy bathroom clock.",3
5102,"This is the Braun Series 3 Model 340s - 4 rechargable ""Wet and Dry"" shaver.I have been using Braun shavers (mostly 7 Series) for over 25+ years and so can claim to know how best to use them especially in terms of shaving method. I was pleased to have the opportunity to test a Braun model from the lower end to see whether it is really necessary to pay a fortune (by buying one of the top end models) to get a really satisfying shave especially as they all tend to make the same claims in terms of the quality of the shave..First impressions were good, a smart and attractive blue and black handset and a similar foil arrangement to that previously used. No fancy extras, no expensive cleaning system, no charging stand, no travel case - just a charging cord, a plastic foil guard, a cleaning brush and a small oil container. ...all that is needed on a basic model. It went on initial charge whilst I read all the claims made about performance and I started to wonder why I had paid such a lot for several Series 7 shavers.When it was fully charged I left it to try the next morning. I shave daily so the length of my beard is never long enough to cause a razor to struggle. So when it came to the first shave I was a little disappointed with the performance. The shave was patchy and to get an ""acceptable"" shave took repeated passes and the time taken was in excess of 12 mins. Each day since then I have used the shaver and by today that makes 35 shaves. Regrettably performance has not really improved in fact I have even had to finish off with the 7 Series shaver. One thing I noticed early on was the distinct note change of the motor when it started the shave. I took it away from my face and the note of the motor rose. This does not happen with other models so I thought the Series 3 might be a bit under-powered ?...or not have enough to run at a constant speed whether shaving or not.This then highlights some of the claims made by Braun for this model as follows ....45 mins of shaving which equate to a week between charges.....45 mins yes but only 4 days shaving. I guess type of beard has an effect on this and what level of effectiveness you seek.great performance on 3 day beards.....not great on 1 day beards !foil cuts easily....takes many passes to remove stubbleclose shave ....only.acceptable after at least 12 minsskin comfort ....thankfully with the length of time it is taking I have no complaints about skin irritationeasy to clean....yes it is and being a wet or dry shaver can be cleaned under the tapcan be used corded or uncorded .....NO IT CANNOT. When the cord is connected (for charging) the ON/OFF button is immobilized. This is a rechargeable shaver not a mains or even dual power shaver.On the plus side it has a nice feel in the hand, is easily recharged when the red light flashes and a full charge is indicated by a constant green light.. I have not tried this unit as a wet shaver and so will not make any comment or draw conclusions. If I want a wet shave I use Wilkinson Sword for a few pounds.The shaver carries a 2 year warranty which I think is common to Braun shavers but remember to register your purchase.To summarise it's a basic shaver with no frills, works adequately but takes time to produce a good shave. ( If you are moving from a rotary, you need to significantly alter your technique ) and is perhaps a little under powered making it less effective. It is however a third of the price of it;s bigger cousins.",3
5103,This is the re-chargeable version and does not shave from the mains.  This wasn't clear to me when I purchased it from the information on the website.,3
5104,"This is the second large box that we've bought and we've since switched to Johnson's Extra Sensitive wipes. We liked the Water Wipes, but we found that the first half of the packs aren't wet enough. Once past this, they're better. Each full pack is also very heavy. When putting a full pack in the changing bag, they do weigh it down. Contrast this with Johnson's and Johnson's are lighter. I think this is due to Johnson's wipes being thinner, but by no means inferior.Worth a go - it's personal preference. We've tried Johnson's Extra Sensitive and Pampers Sensitive wipes and these do seem better than Water Wipes.",3
5105,"This is well-paced and I liked the eclipse setting, but somewhat predictable and not in the least deep or literary in any way",3
5106,This item works on some phones but unfortunately not on Sony Xperia as the buttons are in the wrong position,3
5107,"This model comes with a ""smart guide"", a battery powered LCD display which connects to the toothbrush via Bluetooth, and displays a timer and quadrant marker which changes every 30 seconds to indicate to move to the next quadrant of the mouth. It also displays a smiley face and a star rating when brushing has finished. The device is something of a gimmick but may be useful for children to get them into proper brushing habits.There is also an app for smartphones which connects to the toothbrush. This has a number of shortcomings. Firstly, it demands access to services on the phone such as your location, contacts, media files and so on. There is absolutely no reason for this kind of app to need to gain access to these, and you don't know what kind of personal data it might be sending back to Oral-B. Secondly, it does not automatically ask to turn on Bluetooth when it is started, so I tend to forget to do this (I don't keep it on to save power) and end of half way through my brushing before I realise that I have forgotten. Thirdly, although you can customise the timer on the phone (personally I find that the built-in 2 minutes is never long enough), it does not change the timer sequence on the phone itself, so it will still buzz after 2 minutes to indicate finish even though your custom timer is still going.The Bluetooth serves to drain the battery faster, and it seems to take longer to charge up than the lesser models of Oral-Bs. It seems only really worth having for a family with children to are trying to instil good brushing habits into their children.",3
5108,This produce is good once fitted but found the instructions difficult to follow and managed to spoil one of the screen protectors. Fitted the second successfully although you do have to take to ensure the phone screen is absolutely clear before applying the screen protector.,3

After purchasing the velcro it has been perfect and my room stays completely dark up untill morning. I defintely recommend it but recommend velcro or magnets to be purchased with it (adhesive).",3
5116,"This product seems sufficient ,although bought for an I phone 6s it doesn't fit the whole screen as should do.",3
5117,This razor is a good but for a rechargeable razor - nothing fancy - just does what it says on the tin. Fine to use in the shower. Close shave without too much irritated skin afterwards.,3
5118,"This review seems to fall into two parts:1) The quality of the clean. This is outstanding. The array of brushes you get is great (4 heads) so you don't have that usual dilemma of ""which brush is best for me"", you can try them all out. I found the standard round one to be best for me.The clean, as I said, is amazing. I've had a lot of electric toothbrushes in the past, most of them oral-b, and this one is the best by far. It's very powerful compared to models I've used in the past.2) The features.- I like the charge indicator. In the past I've had issues with not being bothered to charge the brush and not realising the battery is low and the brush isn't operating 100%. This one, once it gets to one ""bar"", just charge it. Easy.- I like the timer on the brush. Yes most brushes have these, but the lights flashing are also pretty useful, I didn't think they would be.- I do not see the point in the Bluetooth features. It's, frankly, of no use to me whatsoever. It seems to store length of time brushing and number of times brushing, and nothing else. What use is this exactly? The timer will tell you to brush for 2 minutes anyway, and for an adult this seems a bit patronising to be honest.- I do not like the android app. It doesn't seem to work properly, although it's new so I imagine they'll fix it. It's also supposed to sync past brushings but doesn't seem to.- I like the mode selector although I really only use two modes - normal and sensitive. Most of the other modes seem a bit faffy and there for the sake of saying ""6 modes"".So in summary - great brush, shame they couldn't find a good way to implement Bluetooth. Yet.",3
5119,This screen protector is great! It came really fast and does just as it says. Would buy again.,3
5120,"This Series 9 Braun shaver is the latest effort from Braun. I have used electric shavers on and off for years but always use a basic razor blade in the end. No matter what the box says, the fact is that the performance never quite matches my own expectation and those shown in the adverts. Braun have made a very nice feeling shaver. It feels substantial but not overly heavy. The shaver sits in a base unit which performs two functions. One to power the shaver and the second to clean it. Once unpacked the cleaning solution vessel needs to be put into the base unit. Thankfully, this is an easy process.To charge and ultimately use the shaver I had to buy an adapter as the power cable is one of those 2 pronged plugs for sockets you often find in bathrooms and especially hotels. Once charged I gave the shaver a go. I wasn't overly impressed. However, I kept going and in fairness it did leave a reasonable finish. I also have to acknowledge that it takes time to get used to the shaver to make the best of it.A month on and how do I feel about it? Well, its a very, very well made shaver which oozes quality. In this regard it is worth the outlay (which is significant). However, performance is mixed. It claims to be able to deal with 3 day old stubble. I haven't found that to be the case. Areas can be left well shaven but other areas, especially around the neck are frustratingly left badly shaved. To achieve the outcome you see on the adverts you have to go at it for some time. This isn't something I have a lot of in a morning or even an evening these days and I had hoped this shaver would reduce time spent on shaving rather than increase it. The simple fact is, at least in my case, that although performance is ok it takes too long to get there and furthermore, it still didn't leave results I was blown away by. I do keep using the shaver because if you use it regularly I have found it can keep on top of the stubble sufficiently enough. I don't quite feel the Series 9 signifies the end of my old wet razor blade just yet, but Braun are closer than they ever have been in my view. Unlike other shavers I have had which now gather dust in the back of the draw, this one is used regularly. It just complements my razor blade. I look forward to the day I can ditch it completely but that isn't here just yet.",3
5121,"This shade blocks the light but the edges are always gaping leaving cracks for light to come through. The suction cups aren't the strogest so they fall and I've actually resorted to taping the edges to the window to prevent light leakage.My biggest complaint though is how hot it gets. Obviously black absorbs light so it would have been great to have a white layer facing out, because on hot summer days having this shade in the window heats up the room by a few degrees.",3
5122,"This story interweaves eclipse chasing, a rape trial and its aftermath and the lies people tell to protect others. So what is good about it? I loved the ending, where essentially most of the main characters got their just deserts (and showed elements in the characters that had been completely absent during the rest of the 15 years covered by the book). I found it much too long. I more or less gave up at page 300 or so, but decided to persist (it is August after all). One of the problems I found was that Beth seemed like the only truly likeable character, while Laura and Kit seem to devote a lot of effort trying to avoid her because of some (largely hinted at rather than specified) past behaviour. How Laura ever saw anything attractive in Kit was a complete mystery, unless he is spectacularly good looking. He has an apparently glittering academic background, but in daily life is dim and gauche, forever under the shadow of his charismatic (but deeply flawed) twin Mac. I found the eclipse stuff pretty boring, and there was far too much of it, and Kit seems obsessed by keeping maps of them. Laura herself seems pretty unfathomable. I couldn't work out what made her tick. It is not a truly bad book, but I would say if you give it a miss your life will not be diminished.",3
5123,This story started off okay before getting a tad predictable tho it was an enjoyable read it only deserved three stars,3
5124,"This thriller is set across a sixteen year time period, starting in March 2015 but then returning to summer 1999 when two of the central characters, Kit and Laura, together with Kit's twin Mac and his girlfriend Ling, experience a total eclipse of the sun during a festival at The Lizard, Cornwall.  Laura witnesses what she perceives is a rape, and during the subsequent trial where she is a key witness embellishes her evidence with a white lie that she justifies as supporting a greater truth. The subsequent story revolves around the consequences.The novel seems to promise an exploration of this story (did/ he didn't he, was he wrongly accused?), but it doesn't really go down this path at all. The subsequent story involves the themes of obsession and deception. It is presented as Beth, the victim, stalking Laura and Kit, but is turned on its head about 100 pages from the end by a twist to the events at the 1999 festival. However, the reader then realises that the story is really built around this change of direction, and that in order for it to work one has to accept some really pretty unlikely and extreme behaviours.The final climatic scenes border on the silly, and ultimately the male characters are either psychopaths, obsessively deceptional or destructively addictional (although Mac does sober up enough by the end to start of health food business).Although the book was reasonably well written and the change of direction sudden, unexpected and to some extent cleverly executed, the whole thing was reliant on some rather unlikely and extreme behaviour from at least three of the characters, and so ultimately stretched credibility to breaking point. I can't believe in the circumstances that charges would have been brought against Kit, and in common with another reviewer, Laura's comment on the final page made me laugh...",3
5125,"This tooth brush is completely over the top, and I think must have been the result of a meeting at Oral B where they decided to make the most bonkers toothbrush they could to see if anyone would buy it.  It's truly insane.It's actually excellent at what it does though.  The little wireless smart guide is surprisingly motivating at making you brush your teeth properly.  I'm in my 40's and I still find myself trying to get the little face to smile as if I was a little boy - it's annoying how obviously susceptible to feeble psychological ploys I must be...Bluetooth connectivity?  Oh come on, who needs that?  The phone app gives you the same countdown timer as the smart guide, and tracks your brushing history in the form of graphs.  It also gives you news updates, and hints and tips, and the novelty will wear off as soon as you realise you're getting toothpaste all over your phone.  When people notice the app on my phone I'm actually faintly embarrassed to own something as ridiculous as a bluetooth enabled toothbrush.  Absolutely crazy.The thing is though, this brush is pretty much identical to the Oral-B 4000 toothbrush, only with extra bells and whistles that are just gimmcks you don't need.  In fact, as I find myself only ever  using the basic cleaning mode on this thing, I'd be just as well off with using the considerably cheaper Pro 600 version.This toothbrush is undeniably good at what it does, but when you can get the core suitability and effectiveness from a version costing 25% of the cost of this one, (the Pro 600 version) then I can't in good faith give this a good score.  Save your money.",3
5126,"This trimmer is fit for purpose, but it is not as good as I was expecting. I would recommend it for use in a home office.",3
5127,"This was a great product for my newborn, as I was worried about switching from cotton wool and water to 'standard wipes' with their added chemicals etc.However, I do have a few gripes.  They are much thinner than other wipes which I personally disliked and felt was the reason I used more wipes than I would have otherwise.  My husband and I both found it difficult to remove one wipe at a time, as a few would come out at once which became increasingly annoying as it happened repeatedly.  The wipes seemed to lack moisture even when first opened - perhaps unavoidably due to their 'natural' nature but I felt it meant firmer rubbing against baby's skin.  These wipes obviously cost a lot more than conventional wipes.I would overall still recommend them for the early days as a convenient alternative to cotton wool and water.",3
5128,This was a nice easy read. Not too much to think about- just what I needed to unwind. It didn't completely grip me like some books but is a nice book.,3
5129,"This was not what I was expecting to be honest! It is small, it barely does the job, if you want to use it for 2-3 pages at a time you may find it struggle. It is certainly for the odd picture trimming if thats what you are going for. Remember it is A5 size so don't get if you want to trim A4 size photos!",3
5130,"Those wipes are amazing to clean baby's bottom. It's the second pack I purchased and in this pack, the wipes are an inch shorter than in the previous pack and not as ""wet"". Still do a good job though.",3

5132,"Three stars because I've used this screen protector before on my iphone SE and it was absolutely brilliant, keeping the phone in a brilliant condition.

5133,"Tight fit and holds iPhone 8+, However the outside plastic on the extendable arms has fallen off exposing the spring device inside.",3
5134,TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS -  I had Braun for all my life and always top of range. Last one was a Serie 9 (now being sold as Serie 7) - still working perfect - made of mainly METAL and around 10 years old now - perfectThe new one shaves a tiny bit better - 2 times less noisy but cheap plastic and cheap chrome over it - truly not in line with such a price and Braun qualitySo it is simply Ok ....,3
5135,too much water in the wipes,3
5136,Too small for iphone 6s,3
5137,Too small for what I required. Unfortunately I didn't check size before purchasing so this was my fault.,3

5146,Unfortunately the protector doesn't cover the whole screen of my iPhone 6s unlike my last one,3
5147,Unfortunately we were unable to get the suction cups to work on our windows as they have a privacy film on the glass. Managed to use it by securing round a spring loaded rail and fixing in window recess. Certainly blacks out the room.,3
5148,"Unlike the other Braun trimmer I reviewed recently, this feels like the real deal. Solidly made, enough weight and easy to use. Mostly I have used rotary shavers, so trying this out was a good opportunity. It's good. It shaves closer in my opinion than the rotary; but here's the issue it works best on one days stubble. Anything longer and it appears to struggle or miss entirely. The rotary would shave stubble that's longer but this just seems to miss.Other than that it delivered, the trimmer is good, the comb bits work well, it charges in a reasonable time. Shaving head and trimmer clip on both ways round which makes it easy. Comes with a shaver point plug so you'll need an adaptor if you want to use it with a regular three pin socket.I hesitated between three and four stars. In the end the frustration of having to trim a three growth before it would shave off won. But if you're clean shaven and shave every - or even twice - a day then I think you might like this.",3
5149,Update. They do shatter at the slightest drop!!,3
5150,Upgraded from 7 series and this is a worthy upgrade. Wet and dry makes for very easy washing as you don't need to worry when putting it under the tap.Technologies seem impressive and cuts very well without any irritation.The only issue is that the shaver head is larger than the seven series which makes it a little difficult to shave the top lip area easily.,3
5151,Use as a stand by,3
5152,"Used daily since June 2015. Last three shavers were Philips but the costs of foil/cutter replacements was very high, almost the same as this complete shaver which was on an hourly offer. This shaver received a very good review on Which? and, because of the offer at Amazon, I bought it.Having a wet option was essential, it is comfortable to hold and recharges very quickly. It cannot be used when connected to the mains but that isn't a problem.Tried dry shaving but that wasn't ideal and so reverted to a wet/soap shave (as used with the Philips). This was very good for the first couple of weeks, but then, very gradually, I realised that the shave took longer. Now I have to repeatedly shave up/down/sideways and even with a circular motion in order to have a reasonably close shave.I suppose that, considering the price of the shaver, it is reasonably good value but, after I have used the replacement foil I also purchased, I will be returning to a Philips wet/dry shaver.",3
5153,"Used for some time now, efficiency fell off fairly rapidly....shave taking longer, and not as close as wished, easy to clean and battery charge is long enough lasting, but I think it is due for new cutters, and as these are included in the foil head, I reckon it will be expensive, as was the whole unit.",3
5154,"Used these for baby's first month - really handy for cleaning without soaps etc. Also, it leaves far fewer strands of cotton on the skin than cotton wool balls. After a while they just weren't enough to keep baby clean. The other issue is that often you can't pull out a single tissue,  instead ending up with a clump of 4 or 5 that takes two hands to disentangle - made those times when only one hand is free very difficult and frustrating. But would still recommend this product for the early weeks.",3
5155,"Used these when had my daughter 4 years ago for 6 months as she had very sensitive skin, due my second in June so automatically went back to them to stock up. Great product but... arrived in damaged box soaked and mouldy due to a faulty pack in the box and no way of contacting seller so slightly gutted as they arnt cheap. Debating on buying more now.",3
5156,Useful as a blackout blind when travelling. Sometimes the top corners fall off during the night.,3
5157,Value for money. But its bit thick.,3
5158,"Very bulky, although it protects the phone you can feel/see it constantly.",3
5159,Very clever idea. Good as can fit on to a window of varying sizes due to Velcro which can shorten the material. Does take a while to perfect and get the hang of it though which can be a faff at times - especially if wanting to get it up quickly! Worth the money though.,3
5160,"Very cold to skin, baby would get scared when touched to the skin. Otherwise a good product if you want to go all natural :)",3
5161,"Very contrived and as the secrets are revealed, quite unbelievable.  I had no sympathy with any of the characters and the ending was totally ridiculous.  Laura is a pathetic character.  I wanted to shake her half the time.  Kit is hardly covered in glory either but at least he comes clean in the end and pays his dues whereas Laura never admits to her own 'sins' in court.  In fact, I did rather feel a hint of pity for Kit in the end but I thought he at least had the chance of finding a worthwhile partner. He was certainly well shot of Laura.  I cannot fathom why The Sunday Times were so ecstatic about it:  there are far more worthwhile novels to heap praise on.",3
5162,"Very disappointed at the top of the range razor, not being as good or even better than the previous top of the range Philips I bought nearly 2 years ago. I expect foil razors to be excellent when it comes to shaving very short hairs but this takes far too long to get a really close shave. Also, the cleaning fluid needs to be changed after approximately 21 uses? Compared to Philips 100 uses approximately. and they charge as much. Now a good reason to clean it every 2 weeks instead of daily.Update after using this shaver for 10 months now, its finally dawned on me how to use this shaver to the best of my abilities.I recently bought a triple pack of cleaning fluid, now fortunately a lot cheaper than when I bought the shaver. However still too expensive if you use them to clean the shaver daily. Apparently they last about 22 cleanings. Before I never cleaned it except with tap water, however I stated smelling a staleness to it after a while. So now what I do is use  the shaver daily, leave it in its stand the wrong way up (that's to stop hair dropping into the receptacle where the cleaning fluid comes out), then when I need to recharge it I clean it underneath the tap and alsonusing a brush before charging it, so no bristles are mixing with the cleaning fluid and contaminating the fluid container. However once a week I actually recharge it and use the cleaning fluid. When I'm not using the cleaning fluid I take it out of the charging stand and put the cap which you have to remove back into the top of the reservoir fluid to stop it from evaporating. This way in expect then fluid to last at least 2 years.Hope this is understandable and helps anyone.",3
5163,Very disappointed only 9 days battery life bought this as it advertised 14 days between charges and it is taking 20 hours to charge.,3
5164,very disappointed with this product considering how expensive it ishad a much better shave with a product costing a fraction of this oneI would not recommend it to anyone,3
5165,Very disappointed with this razor.  I have very light stubble so I thought it would be ideal.  Unfortunately I gave my 6 year old razor away when I got this,3
5166,"Very disappointing extremely derivative story, a shall we say disturbed person, familiar from many other writers does the sort of thing disturbed people do.It reminds me of stock Nicci French women in  peril stuff, like Killing me softly this book has a side issue tacked on. In this case it is eclipses if you are an eclipse nut you may enjoy this I wanted to get through the darkened skiesand on with the plot. Killing me Softly had  a similar dull side -interest in that case mountains.The continulal jumping back and forward in time I found irritating it was already difficult to get into the story without the constant rearranging of my brain.I admit I have read a lot of thrillers if you haven't, the plot may seem more novel and I can see some finding it enjoyable. I didn't like it at all.",3
5167,"Very dissappointed with this item. It was billed as an exact replacement by Amazon for a Braun product that I have, so I did not spend much time researching it. It arrived as per it being a Prime order. It shaves as well as its predecessor here comes the BUT, it does not have the trimmer that my other one that I bought it to replace has. By this time I had recycled my other razor.Amazon, check your facts please!!",3
5168,"Very easy instructions and kit to place on the iPhone nicely and dust free. Prior to buying, I did read that it does not fit right to the edge of the screen. However, it is more noticeable than expected and the gap is quite large, couple of millimeters at least. This means the screen is not entirely protected and you'd expect that for a £700 phone, the screen protectors are made more cautiously. Other than that, the product is great and would get 5 stars.",3
5169,Very easy to fit etc but could of been little bigger does not fill the whole screen great price,3
5170,"Very fast delivery. Only problem I have, once I opened the box, the one side was soaked through. My son isn't due till end of Feb 2016, I hope by then I'm not suck with 12 packs of dried up wipes :/",3

5172,"Very gimmicky. The App is way over due an update. battery lasts maybe 10 brushes, at a push (5 days).However I did like the clean feeling after the brushing and also the range of heads that come with this.Next time, however, I'll be going back to Phillips - Far superior in my opinion.",3
5173,Very good and useful but check suction pads for any damage or blend on the edges.Some suction pads don't work properly when apparently you feel them very hard sticked.It's useful becouse of the resize capacity.,3
5174,Very good at keeping light out when it stays stuck.  Very often falls off the window,3

5181,Very good the twist at the end was unexpected but it jumped around too much for me,3
5182,Very hard to get to fit the window. One of the suckers is ripping off after a few days.I love the design on the front. While it's up it makes the room very dark.,3
5183,Very pleased with the pump itself but the quality of the print in the instructions is appalling to the point that I don't know what one part is for!,3
5184,Very pretty earrings though hook far too long and hangs below the bottom of the earring making it look as if part is missing. Is much smaller than appears in the picture.,3
5185,"Very slow to start on home page, have to wait ages to scroll down on home page, would`nt buy another one, not worth the money,",3
5186,Very small but nice earrings.,3
5187,"Very smooth finish IF YOU SHAVE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY. But surely any shaver would do that. The charger/ cleaning base is useful, but a rinse under a hot tap would do just as well.Within the last week the Amazon price has come down from the RRP of £330 !!! to £221. Is it worth it ? If you have the money and are happy with an okay finish, then go for it.  The okay finish refers to the following:When I first had my shaver I had 6 days growth. I had a dry shave on one side of my face which took ages and removed only most. The other half I had a wet shave (with King Of Shaves gel) and nothing came off.  Finished all over with my favorite, WILKINSON SWORD HYDRO POWER 5 razor.  For the next few days I only use the 9095. But it took just as long has a wet shave. But it was still having difficulty removing all of my stubble.At this sort of price this 9095 shaver should be the cat's whiskers... but it is not (probably would not remove all of them either !!). However, it should be okay for the COE type of businessman to have in his en-suite at his office.Works without the power cord and charges without or with the base. Just plug direct to the cable. Nice hard travel case which is just a little larger than the shaver, handy for journeys.So to sum up; the product looks fab. The idea is excellent, but the ""cutting edge"" technology does not cut that well. Watch the video and then discard all the shavers finishing results. To be honest 3 stars is generous, 2 stars is a little tight... 2.25 stars is more accurate considing the price/finish results scale.",3
5188,Very strange why this protector is not made to fit the iPhone 6s.  All it needs is an extra few millimetres all around.  It makes it look odd and takes away from the sleek look of the phone.  Apart from this the protector is the best I have every had. I had no issues with the fitting.  If I can do it anyone can.,3
5189,"Was a wet shave  man, an decided now I'm retired to try a shaver. it is not as good as my shaves used to be , but is ok, seems to be a little better now have used it for a  month, but is still not as good as a  wet shave",3
5190,Was expecting so much more from this book as the reviews were brilliant but I found it a bit of a let down. It was soooo long winded and I had guessed the twist/plot long before the end. Let's just say it's okay but I won't be putting it on my favourites list. Glad I only paid 99p for it.,3

5192,"was sent an advanced copy in return for my independent honest review.I was really looking forward to this as the premise sounded really exciting. I am a big fan of suspense filled psychological thrillers with a good unexpected twist at the end.Unfortunately I felt that there were so many twist and turns it spoilt the plot for me. On this occasion it was a case of 'less is more'. would have enhanced my read. It is a slow burner to start with and due to this I nearly stopped reading it.You get the sense that something awful has been seen by our two main protagonist's and may well be in a witness protection scheme.  I found the crime  somewhat perplexing. A very serious and importanttopic is being covered here and  I did not find the writing style gave enough gravity to it. A court case ensues which I found somewhat weak. The characters are well developed, however I personally couldn't form an attachment to any of them.It is worth a try as many have loved it and Perhaps it is a matter of personal taste.Sorry but not for me.",3

5197,Water tends to all collect at the bottom leaving the top ones dry,3
5198,"Water Wipes are probably the wettest wipe on the market. For a baby's first 2 weeks, this in theory is a good thing given what comes out of them during this time! But the massive downside is that the wetness makes them freezing cold. Our newborn hated her nappy being changed, screaming the house down every time, and I'm certain the cold wipes were partly to blame for that. When I noticed my husband was squeezing the water out of the wipes before every nappy change, I switched brand, berating the expense of them, swearing off them for life.6 months in and weaning means you have messy faces, necks and hands to wipe up. I have relented and repurchased Water Wipes in order to deal with this and admit they tackle it better than other wipes. 1 wipe and you're done. Tried them again on baby's bottom, she's used to nappy changes now, and she puts up with them but you can still see her react to their coldness. They won't be a regular purchase in this house but are useful to have a pack or two lying around.With regards to the brand, Water Wipes are really about if you think chemicals in your wipes are harmful. You're paying for peace of mind over quality, convenience or any hard evidence that normal wipes damage baby's skin. You have to laugh at the price of them, surely 'chemicals' cost more than the price of water, so why are 'chemical-free' wipes nearly 3 times more?",3

5201,"We bought this to blackout our children’s bedrooms window at home. For that purpose it works OKIt’s a big blind so covers a large space. Plus there are plenty of suckers on there so you avoid the frame etc without fuss. The material is also thick and dark, meaning that even on a sunny June day like today it worksMy only criticism is that the suckers themselves are rubbish. The ones in the corner seems to look their suck and so fall, meaning that the blind falls down. I thought it might be because of a defect but the suckers look ok.",3
5202,"We ended up using alfoil instead (great solution for home) as the suction cups on the blackout blind didn't really stick to the window properly. It is a great product, but maybe it just isn't suited to our style of window.",3
5203,We have gone from a Samsung to kindle fire kids wish we hadn't. My 2 year old gets very frustrated with this tablet it freezes and things don't always load. Not sure if I'm doing it wrong but it comes with the year subscription in the child's name but to download anything you have to be on an adult profile so the subscription then doesn't show up so how do you get anything from the subscription,3
5204,"We needed a cutter, this fits the bill and cheaper than similar ones in the high street. Not much more to add!",3
5205,"We ordered 2 of these to go onto windows of baby's bedroom. They do the job of blacking out the light, but this product is not so strong when it comes to portability.  We have resorted to leaving the blinds on permanently. If we were to remove the blinds each day to let in the sunlight, we would have an enduring battle to keep the blind in place again for each bedtime. The suckers aren't designed well enough to stick in place first time.Somewhat useful as a travel aid, just make sure you put the blind up early when you arrive at your destination.",3
5206,"We use these because they are not full of chemicals, however they are really difficult to get out of the packet one at a time so you end up pulling out a load and then can't get them back in. Because the lid is a sticker they are also not suitable for the baby bag unless you want water everywhere (not loads)",3
5207,"We've used Braun Oral B toothbrushes in the house for years and only recently changed to the latest model before this 6000 version came out.The 6000 CrossAction model features 5 different brush modes (despite the 6 in Amazon's heading), which I was surprised to find were exactly the same as the much lower priced model.  Why the extra, then?  Well this model has a new Bluetooth function which allows you to connect it to tablets and smartphones.Firstly, the box comes with an LCD monitor screen that shows a smiley face with a circle split into 4, 4 different brush heads, a stand for the brush and heads and a carry case.  It's a good package and the screen looks impressive, though it's exactly the same as the last 2 models.The screen is mainly for giving you a visual indication of which area of the teeth you need to brush, from top right through to top left in a circular motion.  The segments appear every 30 seconds and a timer shows how long you have left in each segment.  It also shows whether your battery is about to run out and need a recharge and will give you an indication if you are brushing too hard, with the face changing to an unhappy one if you do.The brush is also designed to be used with a companion App that emulates the tool you get in the box, though it allows for either the classic circle look or a visual representation of your teeth.  You can also choose to show news, weather and other items, which seems a bit pointless as it would be best to concentrate on proper brushing.The other thing the app does, and does well, is to monitor your brush time, so you can check how long you've brushed for in a given week or month, and the brushes/modes you've used, with a handy reminder to change brush heads.After using for a week, I'd say that the App is really a bit pointless when you already have the LCD screen in the box, unless you really need to keep track of brushing times.  For the extra money needed to get this brush over the next model down, it's not really worth the cost.  That's not to say the brush isn't good, it's well made and well thought out with plenty of features, just that some seem un-necessary.",3
5208,"Well there has been plenty of hype over this novel and, up to a point I think it's justified. It's in the Gone Girl vein but I found it rather padded out and all,the "" eclipse "" stuff rather a red herring as it didn't really add anything to the story . The "" shock twist"" ending was also rather predictable . However it's a good "" beach read"" and overall enjoyable .",3
5209,"When charged it is great, only think is that it des not hold it's charge as long as I expected.However teeth feel great after",3
5210,"When I decided I needed a new shaver I did what all other men do (let's be honest, there shouldn't be women looking for these beasts) - I read lots of online reviews.A fair few of them were obsessed with how close to wet shaving this shaver is.  I think that is wrong.  Previous to this I alternated between a panasonic linear from 7 years ago and a wet shave.  (When I say wet, I mean proper style - with the double edge shavers not those Gillette nonsense).  I was bored of the panasonic so I decided to go for the top of the range braun again as my old braun (one of the first with the cleaning thing) was great.Truth is (after all that reading) there is a great deal between a 7 year old panasonic and a brand new top of the range braun.  I think Braun have reached their limit frankly.  I haven't used a series 7 but I can't imagine there is much difference if there isn't much between my old panasonic.  I would even say the head on this is possibly too big to get to places it needs to like the top lip and adam's apple.And I would say this too to all those obsessed with wet shaving - wet shaving is an experience so electric will NEVER be the same.You can really enjoy a Nivarna album on vinyl but it is much easier to listen to it on Spotify, you can take a really great picture with your DSLR but it is easier to carry your iPhone in your pocket all day to take snaps, you can grind the beans and percolate a lovely coffee or just boil the kettle and add the granules.  There are loads of things in life that bring much joy when you do them properly (and we should aim to otherwise life is rubbish).  But sometimes you just need to get something done, and so long as you occasionally do it properly, no harm is done.  So when you have time, wet shave.  When you don't use this thing.But stop trying to think that electric will ever be the same as wet.  It isn't for anything else we men enjoy.",3
5211,"When I first got this, I thought it's good. Well it was until the last few weeks. The fine edge cutting I had is no longer happening. It leaves rough edges which I now have to use scissors to trim - which is pointless a this was the reason I bought it after reading the reviews. If you use it occasionally only then it may be suitable but I would recommend trying a guillotine, especially if you are trimming card, or photos etc.",3
5212,When I give a 3 it means it does the job at a good price. Thats about it for these. Good service and I'd buy again.,3
5213,"Will buy them again and again and again.No residue, soft against baby's skin, and actually great in the car for adults as wipes. Far superior to any others I have used.Changed to 3 stars due to constant change in price ranging from £13.50 to £19.99. Ridiculous.",3
5214,Will never replace a wet shave I'm afraid.,3
5215,Will shave your face like a razor cut however it takes  lifetime. It misses loads of hairs (even pulling skin tight) so I end up finishing off with a razor anyway,3
5216,"Wipes are a bit on a hard side, they could be softer...Some of them are not wet enough",3
5217,Wish i had read the reviews first. Does not cut A4 paper length ways only on the shorter width ways. I need to do both so it suits my purpose. Its made from plastic and not very heavy so pressure used to cut paper is what keeps it steady while in use. Its cheap but does the job. If you need better quality pay the extra and get a different model if not this works well enough.,3
5218,"Wish it would come with a wet cleaning cloth. On the 1st one some dust was left, which caused matte areas and not a clear screen. The dust stuck to the glass screen glue so I straight away had to use the 2nd one :/ Can't say anything about the protection level yet.",3
5219,Won't stick on window,3
5220,Worked ok to start with but soon went quite blunt. Not really good for more than 2 sheets of paper. Bit flimsy.,3
5221,Works fine on the face but doesn't remove hair promptly from neck area and I have to use a blade for that. Battery is surprisingly long-lasting considering I use this item almost daily.,3
5222,Works great and has cool stuff kids will love but yet another monthly subscription and pay apps gallor,3
5223,Works great but the battery is poor compared to my previous Oral-B which I've had for years. I still have the old one and take that on holiday as it still hold a charge longer that the new one. Perhaps because the new one does so much it needs more of a constant charge? But I do agree with other reviews who have described a feeling of super clean after use. It does clean extremely well but the battery is a let down,3
5224,Works OK but not great with longer hairs or around the neck.,3
5225,"Works quite well, for the size window we have though it can be quite clumbsy to put up and lets a lot of light in around the edges still even when combined with black out curtains",3
5226,"Works really well, almost as good as a wet shave- minus the blood!",3
5227,"Works reasonably well, however, there is a button shown on the instruction booklet, that isn't on the device.  Very strange.......",3
5228,"Works well but no miracles for the price all unwanted extras and forced unnecessary technology which is not going to make the teeth shine, not advisable rather buy the regular versions.",3
5229,Works well on several days growth. I am not sure about getting a close shave on a daily basis.,3
5230,Would be really good at blocking out the light if it actually stuck to the window,3
5231,Would have been nice to have something that holds the paper in place at the measurement you want it. Remember to press down hard when slicing as it doesn’t always cut all the way through the paper. But it does be job if you’re on a budget like I was.,3
5232,"Would have expected a little better quality material, maybe thicker so they’d be darker, since they’re so expensive but I didn’t make them so idk. They do the job (mostly) and I’m glad we got them.",3
5233,"Would I describe this as gripping? No. it spends too much time at the start talking about eclipses and the joy of 'chasing' them. The three main characters are Kit, Laura and Beth. Their paths cross at a festival and change dramatically as a result. I wouldn't say this book was full of twists as such, you read events from Laura or Kit's perspective and sometimes far after the fact. I struggled to read this at times because when it went over eclipses and travelling to see them I got bored. This book could have been a lot shorter if not padded out so much by that. I was neither gripped or shocked by this book. It isn't thought provoking, just a bit slow and in original to be honest.",3
5234,"Yeah, the suction cups are useless. Cleaned glass. Check. Cleaned suction cups. Check. 'burped the suction cups on the window'. Check. They just fall off all the time.However the Velcro works. So I've settled with getting some Velcro strip to put across my window frame and stuck it on that way. Now we're talking. Blocks the light out really well, and you can fold it to fit your window shape. I have mine behind my bedroom curtains, tucked onto the window sill, so you would never know it was there when the curtains are closed.Get some better suction cups Gro Company!!",3
5235,"Yes this is a good product and holds my phone in the car. My only slight issue with it is that because i have vertical air vents it does tend to wobble a fair bit but other than that, all good.",3
5236,"Yes, it's OK - just.  My daughter says it sounds like a leaf blower - I've never had such a noisy toothbrush.  After charging it's meant to last two weeks - mine lasts 4 days max and then the red light starts flashing. However long I leave it to charge only 2 lights come on.  I think it's faulty but I've thrown the packaging away and I really can't be arsed to send it back with all the palaver that entails.  I'll just jog on until it packs up and choose my next toothbrush with more care.",3
5237,"Yet another book with unbelievable plot twists. Even though the central characters are very young at the start of the story, I still can't believe they would go to such lengths to cover up such minor offences. That said, it was a easy read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it on holiday.",3
5238,"You can't call it effective, but battery does the job, I charge it once in 3 month",3
5239,you get what you pay for,3
5240,You need a bit of skill to use it with high precision.Obviously its not for industrial purposes. After ~500 cuts it gets harder to cut with it.,3
5241,1 of the screen covers was broken when we opened it the other one was fine,2
5242,2/3 of the usual size!,2
5243,"A bit disappointed with this screen protector.  Mainly because it doesn't fit well, basically leaves about 3-4 mm of the iPhone screen unprotected top and bottom, and to the side could be wider by a couple of  2 mm.  Also I've already got a small chip to one of the sides without giving the phone a hard time. So all in all, not great.",2
5244,"A bit of a fiddle navigating between profiles, setting up permissions etc. Video and camera not great quality, ok for kid's use but could be better. Also when it arrived, even though it was for my daughter and not opened by me personally, it was signed into my account. Actually signed in i.e. didn't need a password! So my husband and daughter had immediate access to my account and details etc. And could have ordered and set up anything as well as accessing my purchase history, which of course is personal data. I found out about this after my husband had set things up - incorrectly, so I had the job of trying to sort all that out too. I was extremely concerned about this breach but understand it is their usual policy...have flagged it up but had no feedback regarding any changes...which makes me wonder what would happen if the package had fallen into the wrong hands.Anybody ever received phone, bank card etc already activated for use with no password or pin? no, me neither.  So if you're ordering this, beware this - or mark as a gift - this is the only time they don't sign it into your account. Very strange policy.",2
5245,"A closer shave than the Philishave. Not as smoorh but certainly smoother than older braun foil shavers I used years ago.Wet and dry shave is definitely a plus!UPDATE: Broke within a month. Blades no longer shave as smooth, foil split and when cleaning head a spring came off.",2
5246,"A closer, faster, more comfortable shave?  No, not as far as I'm concerned.  Sorry, but this shaver does not work for me.  After using it, I invariably have to use an old-fashioned razor to trim hairs it cannot handle, particularly under the nose.  I get a better, easier, quicker shave from my very old smaller single-headed shaver, which is actually easier to handle than this new so-called ergonomically designed monstrosity.  I would not go so far as to say this one is a waste of money; it's useful as a back-up or when travelling or camping.  But otherwise, it's very disappointing.",2
5247,"A few of the suction pads won't stick to the window even after cleaning several times/wetting the pad etc... So, it's been pretty pointless really although I can imagine it would be great if you can actually get it to stick! Disappointed.",2
5248,"A little bit disappointed, but I think it struggles because I have ginger hair and normal razor blades go blunt quick on my face shaving",2
5249,"A little bit disappointed, but I think it struggles because I have ginger hair and normal razor blades go blunt quick on my face shaving",2
5250,A little disappointed it's says its 7lutres yet when you open it and go to use the interior of the cooker is clearly marked 6 litre maximum which for me is too small,2
5251,"A little disappointed! Was quite happy when I first received it, but after using it only twice the fold out ruler has broken off (from where it folds out), and it looks like I will be unable to reattach it. Ultimately, looks like a bit of a design flaw, and I'm a bit gutted because it's a bit useless to me without the foldout ruler, as I'm cutting down A4 paper.",2
5252,A little too flimsy. Maybe I didn't read the description correctly. You get what you pay for.,2
5253,"A metal part of the shaver(i dont know what its called), flew out of the shaver after use. It cant be attached back, very confused. The only reason it is not rated 1 star is because it does a good close shave, sadly the product lasted for one use only, what a waste.",2
5254,"A nice toothbrush with gimmicky Bluetooth connectivity.The problem I have is that the battery only lasts 7 days, and then takes two days to recharge!  My older version Oral B used to charge in 24hr and last a fortnight, but I guess that's progress for you!",2
5255,a nightmare to fit if you have to make it smaller to fit window also falls down all the time,2
5256,"A pure wet wipe minus the chemicals - this certainly ticks the box, although in day to day use I’ve found them frustrating.They’re absolutely soaking in liquid so much so they don’t absorb much mess but just spread it so you use more. With all wetwipes sometimes you pull one and end up with a clump of about five or six - normally flicking them (as your one handed, mid change) will lose the excess wipes giving you the one you need but doing that with these means you end up spraying nearby walls and even the baby with the liquid that splashes as you flick them - they really are that saturated. Leaving one on the bed or sofa will completely soak the area.Pulling out excess wetwipes instead of one is a constant frustration too, more so than I’ve found with other brands - given the expense it’s annoying to pull more than you need out of the pack and then have to wedge them back in.",2
5257,A rather long drawn out storyline with unlikely twists that do not convince this reader. But well written and unusual.,2
5258,A reasonable read but not the ‘thriller’ I was expecting at all. Rambles on and on in places particularly when Kit is on board ship.,2
5259,"A reasonable shave although you will never replace a razor or even get close to one - got rid of three day stubble after quite a few passes - the other downsides - the two pin plug and not able to use whilst charging . For £144 this looked good value given it came with case, cleaning station inc. refill, travel case and the charging lead. Braun - why not supply a USB charging lead instead of a two pin lead OR both  - saves having to buy an adaptor and can be charged anywhere. Overall after 7 weeks use got to say Braun - you need to do better than this in the 21st century. A satisfactory shave that lasts about an hour before you feel like needing another shave....",2
5260,A romantic drama set in post war England that takes the form of a series of letters between a dozen or so people. Its a nice idea but it quickly becomes tiresome and in the end finishing it felt a hell of a lot like homework.,2
5261,Actually really like this brush. But hate the after sale problems as it cannot be charged and work well only after one and a half month. And even worse it was a gift I given out. The only problem while a real big one is it dosen't work after a month's use! Guessing it has somewhere short circuited maybe because of any leaking water. Annoying thing is that found no warranty and those after sale people are BAD. Don't know what to do now....,2
5262,Adaptor plug is useless. Doesn't connect to the shaver firmly.,2
5263,"Admittedly, the following is based on my experience of a slightly older version of the same product – the Triumph 5000 looks to be an ‘enhanced’ version, with more features.  We have had ours for over 2yrs and not had cause for complaint…until now!It frankly shocks me that in this day and age a company so cynically seeks to exploit its customers by selling products that have such an unnecessarily short life.  The battery performance of our toothbrush has been degrading recently, with increasingly frequent charging required.  What should be a relatively simple and cost-effective battery replacement for an otherwise perfectly serviceable (and comparatively expensive) product turns out to be an exercise that will cause the vast majority of customers to throw the whole unit away and replace it.I (foolishly) purchased two compatible replacement batteries online before looking to see how to swap out the original, assuming that it would be a simple case of opening the base, extracting the old battery and inserting the new – rather like a torch.  Having looked at both a video and step-by-step document online, not to mention doing a dry run as far as I could, I am now availing myself of a soldering kit of all things!  I am damned if I’m going to let them get away with this disgraceful exploitation!If it weren’t for this, the rating would be 4 stars or more – performance has been great, we’ve had no issues, and the dentist has been pleased with our teeth (we actually purchased two because my wife travels a lot and wouldn't be without one).  However, Buyer Beware!  Do your research online before buying and find out if this newer version is the same with regard to battery ‘replacement’.",2
5264,"After 2 attempts to get this to work with a set of 8730 powerline wifi extender kit I was unable to log in to the built in config page to set the SSID the same as the other router and extender. The powerline part worked, the wifi connected, but i was not able to control the wifi settings or rename it. This left me to change this out for an RE200 instead which whilst lacking powerline has sorted the black spot issue and allowed me to configure as required.I think the firmware is buggy or at least gets confused when paired with a newer dual band system.",2
5265,After 4 months it is all loose device with trimming parts falling apart and not a great feeling to use at all. Quality is not good. It is also not very convenient,2
5266,"After 5 weeks' experience with these I echo other reviews on here that have pointed out how impossible it is to get one wipe at a time from the packet. No matter what technique you use, they come out in huge sheafs and you then have to flail your hand frantically in an effort to separate them, usually whilst urine and excrement are arcing across the room. Often you just give up and clean using a huge sodden clump of 5 wipes fused together. It wouldn't surprise me if this is entirely deliberate as some brain at HQ has probably determined that it increases sales if you have to use 5 at a time. But it is a massive pain and bad for the environment. We will be buying another brand from now on.",2
5267,After a few days of normal use a chip appeared in the screen and now scratches all over it.,2
5268,After twice trying to fit it with the logo the right way up the unit parted at the join on the back. After turning 180 degrees I managed to achieve some form of hold but not sure how long it will last...,2
5269,Agree with a lot of the reviews on here. Not a close shave and wish I had spent a bit more on a better quality model.,2
5270,All a bit predictable. A bit of a disappointment.,3
5271,All around the edge of this there is a bubble. Have pressed and rubbed hard but no joy. Tried both of the provided protectors with the same result. A shame as it is a good quality protector with a nice feel but with the bubble around the entire screen it makes my 6S look cheap and nasty.,2
5272,"All in all, this product does its job. Passing internet through your existing powerlines in order to receive a wired internet connection in multiple rooms and devices across your household. However, do not  be mislead (like I was) that these will allow you to achieve speeds over 100Mbps. While they are advertised as 600Mbps, the maximum speeds they can output via Ethernet cable is 100Mbps. I have 300Mbps Internet and get about 200Mbps through Wifi in my office. I thought this product would allow me to increase that speed to take full advantage of my internet, but instead it has reduced it. Ill be sticking with Wifi.",2

5275,Although a decent size and definitely blocks out the light I have found the suction cups simply do not stick to the window. I got this one to try and avoid any modifications and unfortunately this did not work for me.,2
5276,Although I liked the use of letters to tell the story I felt that the fiction put on top of what should have been an interesting lesson about the Nazi occupation of Guernsey was poor and unnecessary.,2

5279,"Amazing for short term use. Having used it non stop since it arrived I have taken it down today to find it has broken the window. I think it's the strength of the suckers and how tight you have it. With the sun on it all the time it's putting stress on the glass. I would advise that you put plenty of slack between the suckers.Still good and I will probably still use it, but have now got to replace the window.",2

5291,"As other reviewers have pointed out, it is very difficult to get it into exactly the right place and so leaves visible air gaps around the edge because of the curve of the phone. You can argue that it's not the fault of the manufacturer, but putting this screen protector on the phone makes it look a mess, and that is not clear from the marketing blurb.",2
5292,"As others have stated, it's slightly too small for the screen. However the very edges also don't stick down entirely and therefor it stands out from the screen. Makes the whole phone look cheap. Gets 2* because the phone still works well through it and no bubbles, but there are others that do this without ruining the appearance.",2

5299,Basic to say the least. Having to repeatedly go over the same areas and it still misses hairs. I got it for £22 and that's the top price I'd pay for it.,2
5300,"Basically, it does the job.  However, in my opinion, it doesn't do it any better - and in some ways worse - than the 10 year old series 5 Braun shaver that it replaced.  Let me explain...Shaving head / foils: It has a much larger head than the series 5. This is to accommodate different types of cutting blades for different types of hair direction. Nice idea in theory, but on my own hair, the only blades that seem to do the cutting are the two outer foils.  These were present on my previous shaver head and the average time to shave is about the same.  A difficulty presented is shaving the gap between my top lip and nose - because the shaver head is literally too big to engage both outer foils at once - meaning that the moustache area actually takes longer to shave.Display: What display I hear you say! The series 5 had an lcd digital display that indicated shaving time, time left to discharge, total number of shaves, time to foil replacement, cleaning required etc.  This series 9 display shows nothing until you turn it on - and then only shows either a number of bars to discharge, or, if below 9 minutes, the number of minutes left.  It also has a clean icon. What a shame.Charging: unlike the old series 5, you cannot use this shaver from the mains or while it is being charged. How bonkers is that?! Charging times seem about the same or there abouts.Foil degradation: you can clearly see that the blue anodising of the middle foil is coming off already.  This started to occur after about 3 weeks - and I keep it safely in its little case and look after it carefully.  It must be my face!  Either way, it looks shabby already, and worse than my 10 year old series 5 - poor show.Good points: It feels nicer in the hand than the series 5 - and I really appreciate being able to rinse it under warm water instead of having to use the cleaning station or brush it out. This is a big plus. I have never used it to wet shave.Other points: I haven't tried the cleaning station yet - but it looks much like the old one and takes the same cartridges.  Neither have I tried the beard trimmer though it does have a much smaller surface area than that of the series 5 it replaced. The head lock button doesn't appear to be as good as holding the head fixed as the series 5 - but it hasn't troubled me so far.Am I glad I changed?  Well, I had to - because the batteries no longer held a usable charge for trips on my series 5 and replacement required soldering etc.  I bought this for £159 on a lightning deal - but I still think this was too much when compared to the series 5.Conclusion? It feels nicer to hold and is easier to clean but operationally, it is equal at best and worse in some areas than a model of 10 years previous.  I'm surprised that the tech hasn't developed more in a decade.  Just wish I'd had the nerve to try a Philips!",2
5301,Battery doesn't last as long as it should do - disappointed,2
5302,Battery lasts no more than 2-3 days. Very inconvenient while travelling and makes your constantly carrying the charger. Previous models were way better. Won't recommend this toothbrush. Very disappointed with the purchase,2
5303,"Battery life became bad after a very short few months. Needing to charge couple of times a week, and they take a ludicrously loooong time to charge.Finally died completely 1 year after purchase.Won't be buying another one.",2
5304,Battery on these are worst then last years model. avoid,2
5305,Battey life is very good but the shave continues to miss patches no matter how many times I run the razor over it ! But of a let down especially looking at the rrp,2
5306,"be aware..if you are not from UK, even if you buy the add-free tablet (a bit more expensive) you still get commercials....and even though it is advertised that it comes with 1 year free kids store (or whatever) it does not work for outside UK...stupid amazon policy!!!",2
5307,"Began very well and showed much potential but became increasingly ridiculous. A light, decent, but not outstanding, read.",2
5308,"Being a long term Braun user I was very hopeful that this shaver would deliver on the marketing promises so I bit the bullet and made the investment. Unfortunately, I have been left somewhat disappointed after 3 weeks use.The shaver is well made although it is of plastic construction. It has the power to cut through even 2-3 days of growth with ease but does not provide the level of closeness that I was hoping for. The shave is close but not a big step forward from my old Braun when you consider the purchase price. With this in mind I have reluctantly decided to return it and will now look to purchase a cheaper shave.",2
5309,"Being a muppet I trashed the first screen protector, but the second I fitted without a problem. Took a short while to get use to the trench between the edge of the protector glass and the raise rim of my case. But all is good.Update (Dec 2017) : had to fit a new protectors having cracked the first . Protector arrived in good time, but seems to be even more economic width wise (top to bottom) in that it needs to be 1-2mm wider to fully cover the screen area. Being slimmer then needed it results in a rainbow colour affect down one of the sides with here the glass tapers.",2
5310,Beware! Ni-mh battery not lithium! Get the newer model!!,2
5311,"Bit disappointed this time, wipes are smaller and not as wet as normal. Why the change water wipes?",2
5312,Bit flimsy - ok for small cuts,2
5313,Blocks out the light as it's very thick but it's a huge hassle to set up each night. The suction cups simply don't hold on (especially If the window is cold) and most of them detach within a few minutes. This causes a large portion of the window to remain uncovered even after repeated attempts.,2
5314,"Bluetooth = Utterly pointlessBattery life = pathetic. Pretty good for three months, then rapidly goes downhill. It's fine if you leave it plugged in all the time, but if you don't have a plug in your bathroom, forget it. So you end up with a toothbrush that has a battery which gives you one really good brush, then if you don't  immediately charge it you get a sort of medium to okay one, then it gets more and more insipid from there.Different modes = you cycle through them but there's no indicator to say which one you're using. Rather than being able to see on your toothbrush which mode you're in, you have to look at the weird alarm clock thing they give you. And why on earth doesn't it remember your favourite mode?Plus bulky packaging etc etc.I don't normally write reviews, but this is the sort of thing that you're dentist will say you need, so you splash out to get the best one and actually find it's not what you expected. And I had the Sonicare before which I was quite happy with, but the tooth man said Sonicare wasn't as good... so shelled out again for this one. Ended up with the Sonicare (great but without rotating action it's just not quite as good for gums) and this (great but shocking battery life and loads of pointless accessories)If you could get the motor of this with the practicality of the Panasonic, THEN you'd be laughing (with bright shiny teeth)",2
5315,"Bluetooth system is interesting, albeit the app doesn't run perfectly.Battery life is appalling. I suspect they haven't solved the challenge of the Bluetooth power consumption? In reality this product lasts around 3 days from a full charge - maybe 4 if you don't mind a slow rotation. It also erratically discharges power - it goes from 3 full bars of power during a brush to dead.",2
5316,Boring,2
5317,Boring couldn’t finish it.,2
5318,Both edges of the protector do not stick on the phone screen. Not just a trapped little air bubble but the whole edge...,2
5319,Both of the supplied protectors had manufacturing defects (looked like grit) under the glass that prevented the protector from adhering to my phone's screen. Maybe I got a dud?,2
5320,Bought as a gift and the length of battery charge does not last as long as marketed.  My much cheaper Oral-B last just as long.,2
5321,"Bought as a present but  sent it back, a huge dissaponitment ,wasnt compatible with Sony XA1 android.",2
5322,Bought for a close shave does nothing of the sort kind of wish I never bought it.,2
5323,Bought for the iPhone 6s doesn't completely fit the screen and the blue sticker to clean the screen doesn't peel off properly. Very fiddely and it feels like plastic not glass.,2
5324,"Bought in February, dead end of May...pretty poorIf you leave the shaver on charge too long, it will stop working.This is the second Braun shaver that this has happened to...",2
5325,"Bought in November 2016, battery pretty much dead in January 2017. Despite having followed all the instructions to prolong battery life I now get about 2 - 3 times brushing out it before recharging is needed - disappointing and too expensive for such poor performance",2
5326,"Bought these because they seemed natural, and thought id give them a go from my usual huggies natural care. Although nice and natursl, unscented, etc, i found they were really ROUGH!! Because of this babies bottom became a bit sore (has never happened with my usual wipes- which are really soft).Now i have four packs to get through... Wish I would've just bought one pack to try, because i'm definitely not ever buying them again! Im sticking to my natural care...",2
5327,"Bought these for the simple reason that they said it would be durable and also easy to apply. It is neither. The putting on of the screen protector has proved almost impossible to do “bubble free” and even when I have managed to get it on (even though it looks terrible) the actual protectors are poor at best, I’ve gone through 2 in a matter of weeks, without doing any real Falange to my phone. Definitely won’t be purchasing again.",2
5328,Bought these screen protectors about 2 months ago. Have used both of them and now having to buy a different make. They start to peel off or crack within weeks of use. Try another manufacturer.,2
5329,Bought these twice before but last pack of 2 arrived with one of the sreen protectors being just a piece of plastic- there was no sticky side and no film to peel off before applying. Got that refunded,2
5330,"Bought this as new parents as a temporary measure to keep it dark in our room while the baby sleeps with us. And it does keep it dark, for a few hours at a time, until the suckers come unstuck and it crashes off the window, bathing everyone in a shower of light and waking us all up far more than a gentle dawn light would. We've had to buy Velcro stickers to help the suckers do their job, as they're clearly not substantial enough to hold the heavy curtain up on its own.",2
5331,"Bought this before baby was born as we’d heard good things. Have only just started using it as it’s getting lighter and it’s awful. It’s a bit unwieldy to try and get to to size (the window in baby’s room is quite small), the suckers just do not stick - they’re a pain to get on in the first place and then fall off throughout the night. As such, we don’t want the hassle of taking it up and down every day so it just stays up meaning baby’s room is always semi-darkness (kind of fine at the moment as he only uses it for sleeping at night but will be more of a pain as he gets older!).  It also doesn’t actually make the room dark enough - it’s folded to fit the window but the folds allow for gaps that the light then comes through.Honestly not worth the money.",2
5332,Bought this for a 6s and it doesn't fully cover the screen. The dust remover film made the screen streaky so probably a good thing that it didn't cover the full screen.,2
5333,"Bought this instead of lined curtains so that we could use at the grandparents as well as at home. You've probably get about 15-20 mins to get your little one to sleep as this thing constantly falls off. I've tried wetting the suckers, pressing down heavily but nothing seems to work.Ended up buying blackout lining for home and putting in some cheap blinds at grandparents - much easier!",2
5334,Bought this item in March and within 5 months will no longer charge and feels constantly like it is out of battery.Having spent this much I would expect it to last a lot longer....,2
5335,Bought this screen protector as my Anker (identical) broke. I hoped for same quality for half the price. NOPE. You get what you paying for. It cracked on top corner on first day of use. When my phone was in the pocket. Will never buy again. If you looking for good tempered glass protector spend bit more and get proper one. Quality comes at the price,2
5336,"Bought this shaver for its sensitive features. I have always used electric clippers and tried this Braun to avoid shaving bumps.The shaver is lightweight and well built, charges up very fast and keeps charge. Works well for both wet and dry shaving. It gave me a very close smooth shave (initially happy with it) BUT, I HAD A SEVERE RASH BREAKOUT 24HRS LATER. I don't recommend this for sensitive skin or if you have coarse hair.",2
5337,"bought this thing, it's flimsy especially when you try and install the different trim attachments. The shaving head broke from first use. But the worst thing was the pain while shaving. It pulls through my hairs especially the long ones like nothing else I've tried. It's advertised as ""for any hair length"", but it will literally pull the skin out of you. I was left bleeding in many areas. I am going to stick to normal shaving clippers thank you very much.",2
5338,"Bought to replace Billion equipment that had stopped working, but Wi-Fi strength is very poor compared to the Billion equipment to the extent that I can no longer access online content through my TV. Also be aware that you can't just buy an additional power line adapter as they are only sold in pairs - I wouldn't have bought this if I'd known how poor the signal strength would be.",2
5339,"Brilliant shaver, only problem is it won't turn back on, I've tried charging it and it's still just ...dead. not sure if the battery is fault or the product itself?",2
5340,"Brilliant tablet and case, but no google apps including YouTube kids because Amazon want you to use their content. Maybe it's time for google to remove Amazon from its search index?!",2
5341,broke as soon as i took it out from the packaging,2
5342,Broke very quickly but at least my phone screen was safe,2
5343,Brought a 2 pack and one came cracked very disappointed,2
5344,Brought my oral b early February 2017. The product shows red light consistently while using and none of the settings are working either. I'm afraid it has a fault. Can the seller please advise whether I have an guarantee?,2
5345,Brought this as I thought it would be quicker than trimming with hair flippers or wet shaving but find it misses loads of hair and leaves patches everywhere.I once bought a 1.99 shaver from citrus and find this does the exact same job as that.Also no charger doesn't tell you that and it ran out after 2 uses.,2
5346,Brought this for my boyfriend to use for the back of his neck between barber visits. It's not great so disappointed it didn't really live up to expectations,2
5347,Brought this to use for my baby when we are staying away from home and the thing is impossible to stick to the window! The suction cups are useless and I had to wedge it up between the blind and frame with screwdrivers to make it stay up. The blanket I used before purchasing this was just as good. Don’t waste your money!,2
5348,Buckled within few months of usage,2
5349,But it doesn't fit the screen!! Why? When will one be released that fits and is really for the iPhone 6?,2
5350,Came before expected although it was very difficult to put on the phone. After a couple hours of having it i dropped it from 40cm off the ground and it smashed. Would not recommend.,2
5351,Can barely cut paper.  Have to press really hard to cut and most times you don't get a clean cut.  This is a definite 'get what you pay for',2
5352,Can't do A4 length. Also not happy with it in general. Spend a bit more and get a Cathedral one - that's what I did soon after getting this.,2
5353,"Can't fault the brush, its great but all the connectivity and app features only work if you have android version 7.1.1 or higher which currently many handsets don't have rendering it completely useless. I have a 2016 LG G5 and EE are still yet to deploy the patch so until they do I can't really use half the features of this product. If I had known in advance I wouldn't of purchased this model at all.",2
5354,catches on hair,2
5355,Change of suppliers for the suction cup has left them not strong enough to hold the weight of the curtain. Struggles on glass or pvc. Really enjoying S older versions was the best.,2
5356,"Changed from a Philips rotary as the design looked pretty good. In my view a very disappointing shave and poor design. The on/off switch is in the wrong position right were your thumb is. The real problem is the shave, just does not cut efficiently, have to go over the same area time & time again. Will be going back to a Philips.",2
5357,Charging takes forever,2
5358,Charging time is ridiculous!  Good results though.,2
5359,check to ensure you have the correct plug as this game with a euro plug which was not advertised :(,2
5360,Claw grip came off and got stuck inside vent,2
5361,Constantly falling off window.,2
5362,Could be stronger,2
5363,"Could have been a great tool but for some unfathomable reason you are unable to allow your children to download prime videos whilst offline.  So despite having a Netflix and Amazon Prime account the device is useless offline.It does of course come with a free 1 year subscription to numerous apps, books, etc but the bulk of them only usable online.Frankly not worth it as a kids option and you'd be better off with the full version allowing full prime access.Bizarrely if you log in using your adult account you can then log in and download/watch children's videos for offline use but only when using the adult profile!  Seems crazy to lock offline children's prime videos in the adult area and prevent sharing!",2
5364,Could not get into this one,2
5365,Cracked after a few days and not sure why - hadn't dropped phone or have anything happen to cause it to crack. Very disappointed.,2
5366,Cracked after a few hours without being damaged or hit.,2
5367,Cracked and chipped very easily had to replace within a couple of days and that was from just every day use.,2

5372,"Dear AmazonAlthough the product is great when you get it working, myself and my daughter were absolutely disgusted that once unboxed the kids unlimited app was, well kind of ""limited"". We were unable to use it on Christmas day due to the content not loading onto the carousel, I phoned technical support on boxing day to find out if it was anything I was doing wrong. No, it needed a software update (out of the box), to make matters worse to update it I had to go to my laptop, download some software and put onto the Fire HD via a USB connection to my laptop (so if i didn't have a laptop I would have been buggered). The updated software did work but I spent over 2 hours on the phone to a technical person (who was very good and patient to be fair) to get it working. This is completely unacceptable and this product should not have been sold in this state. The technical guy said I would be compensated and that a complaint was put in but I didn't hear anything which is why I am writing this. The product is great but I think Amazon has rushed this out of the door before Christmas. Just to add this was a main present for my daughter and she was quite disappointed on the day.",2

My first impressions were not good, My old braun was built like a tank! the 9095CC feels like an empty shell made of the cheapest materials China could put together. What has happened to solid feel braun used to have?Still too early to judge its shaving performance, hopefully the cheap feel will be compensated with a Ferrari shave!",2
5374,Definitely good blackout blind but a nightmare to get the suckers to work each time,2

5376,"Desperately disappointed with this. More annoyed with myself that I waited until so close to Christmas to set it up (to get the most out of the free 1 year kids subscription), and probably left my daughter without her main gift on Christmas morning.Having enjoyed a stock Android tablet and the relevant freedom she had with that under carefully applied parental controls, I can't tell you how infuriating this thing was to set up to get it anywhere near the functionality she's used to. It's such a closed and cumbersome system for children AND parents. As another reviewer said, this would have felt to her like she was merely borrowing her Dad's tablet, but with all the best bits locked out for her profile. The current playground spat that removed the option of YouTube Kids was the final straw - mine's on it's way back.I fully understand the need for parents to monitor and control the content their children have access to on mobile devices, but there are so many better ways to implement those on Android systems where your child will feel a level of freedom rather than the fun killing paranoia and wasted hours involved with these things.",2
5377,Despite my best efforts some of the suction caps just don't stay stuck to the window. If it would stay secure I can see it would do the job as a blackout blind.,2

5405,"Disappointing. We have already used android tablets so knew roughly how this would work.  We bought this for our daughters 6th birthday as would be something she could use without so much supervision.  We mainly wanted her to have something she could read books on, use a camera and listen to her own music and audio books.  We have prime and family music unlimited so I thought that this would be a great option without any extra ongoing costs.  I was wrong.You CANNOT USE PRIME VIDEO OR AMAZON MUSIC at all on a kids, or even more ridiculously, a teen user profile.  This seems ridiculous.  Certainly defeated the whole purpose for me.Also let down by not having Alexa on kids profile, not able to add Audible on kids profile and the offline use:  With some pre-downloading offline use is possible BUT it is unclear for kids as all kids content remains visible when offline, even the apps etc which are not downloaded and can't be accessed.  I can see this resulting in a lot of whining mid flight as they chose games and books which they can't have.The layout of the kids profile is also not very clear. If kids have a favourite game, for example, their is no way I have found yet to make it easily accessible or save to a familiar location.You can download BBC programs and Netflix programs to watch offline and these work fine in airplane mode.You can download audible books and play offline, but ONLY on an adult profile.You can download Amazon music and play offline but ONLY on an adult profile.We will keep the device because we bought with £40 off so when considering the cost of a case and kids subscription it was a reasonable price.  As it is it works well as an colour screen ebook but I suspect we will end up giving our 6 year old an adult profile to allow her music access which will render the parental control functions useless.",2

Had to use my £15 Remington travel shaver to finish the bits this couldn't catch!Edit: Almost 2 years into owning this, it still works fine but the only purpose it serves during my grooming is using the beard trimmer to line the edge of my beard, the rest of the device just doesn't do as good a job as other shavers whatsoever so I continue using my cheaper travel shaver which gets a much closer shave. Would much prefer only having to carry one shaver with me while travelling though! The beard trimmer is too basic to shape a beard so I need a third device (groomer) which has a length guard on it. Why can't a device like this be everything in one? It just downright sucks.",2
5426,Doesn't completely black out a room and you could probably do the same with any type of blind. The only benefit to this is you can take it anywhere you go. Cups didn't stick properly despite window being clean and moist as instructed. Product also looks messy on slimmer windows as excess material is left hanging. Will probably stick to conventional blackout blind in nursery and keep this for visits to nanny and granddad.,2
5427,Doesn't cover the sides of the windows. It may work better if you are able to use the suction cups on the window itself. I haven't done this as it says window can break if used for long periods of time. Only for temporary use. I think it would have been better to by regular darkening curtains. This was too expensive to not be able to be used properly. Very disappointed.,2

5450,Don't feel compelled to write reviews BUT this does not fit the screen and the adhesive is poor. The protector is too narrow and nearly covers the screen. The screen didn't have adhesive in one of the corners so it had to be removed. I wish I had bought the jtech which I had bought previously!,2
5451,Don't know what's happened to the Gro Blind. A couple I'd bought a few years earlier stuck so much better than more recent purchases of same blind. Useless at staying put.,2

5454,Dont believe what other reviewers are saying. There is no way this shaver takes off stubble in one pass. It leaves the hair on my neck as well. Had to revert to my philips shaver which was way superior.,2
5455,Dose not stick very well at all.Produt is very big and you can not fold it to fit as suggested as then there are not any attachments down the sides.,2
5456,"Easy to stick. However, the protecter has the size of the screen only, not the whole front of the phone. Its causing a valley-like gap between it and the case",2
5457,"Edit 6th October - Downgraded from 3 stars to 2.  Left 3 days of stubble this time which at 2 shaves a week is pretty much what Philips recommend.  Full wet shave, hot water, shaving foam.  I have far from sensitive skin.  I've attached a picture of the result, rash, cuts and an uneven finish.  In other words it works EXACTLY the same as any other electric shaver.  Fine if you're one of these boys with a few tufts of of wispy hair, absolutely useless as a shaver to the rest of us with actual beards.===Left a weeks worth of stubble especially for this arriving and have to say I'm not that impressed.  Whilst it is OK in certain circumstances it is nothing at all like how the adverts would have you believe.  First of all tried it dry and no matter which way I used it with, across and against the grain it still left patches of longer hair.  Not only that but the extra time spent cleaning up hair that had managed to ping its way half way across the bathroom covering everything in sight negated any time saved.  Anyway one lesson learned and still looking very patchy I decided to try it wet with foam.  A better result all around, this time it managed to get through those stray patches and at least gave a consistent finish.  However this extra closeness seemed to come at the expense of some rash on my neck, avoiding rash was the main reason for giving this a go.  Overall though it was a pretty good shave.  If used wet it would save time and it is definitely more gentle on the skin...just not as gentle as the adverts put across.  Finally I had a normal wet shave and what came off was about the equivalent of 1 days stubble, so as a totally none scientific experiment that is about the difference between this and a good blade.Overall then it will have its uses, I'll use it too thin out a beard when I've left it too long before a normal shave and it will probably come away with me on holiday as well when I'm not overly fussed on a really close shave but I can't see it replacing my usual routine.",2
5458,"Erratic connection. I am trying to connect a Raspberry Pi Zero W based weather station to my main computer using WiFi. Currently the station is less than 10"" from the Powerline adapter. About every 5 to 10 days, the WiFi link gets broken, rendering the previously archived data pointless, as I need a continuous stream of data.Most disappointed, would not recommend this device for serious use",2
5459,Ever since I put the thin layer of glass onto my phone it has effected the recording function.  When I voice recorder whats app it gives me 9 seconds of speak and then drops out. It is so annoying for me and anyone listening to messages now.  I use this function a lot to save time texting and to get a message across.  It started happening the moment I put the screen protector on.  I do not know if it is any good at protecting the screen as I have not dropped my phone to test it.  I wish I could take it off however it seems firmly in place now.,2

Then the toothbrush takes 24hours to be fully charged again!Also,the app is rubbish and pointless therefore the fact that it has Bluetooth is irrelevant. The clock and the fact that it vibrates after 30s are both more than enough to tell you how long you've been brushing. The app doesn't nothing to add to this.My previous oral B triumph was brilliant. And it lasted 6 years before the battery started to die. This toothbrush brushes my teeth just as well as my old one, therefore I think I've paid for a load of pointless extras. I will be returning due to what I assume to be a faulty battery. Next time I'll go for the cheaper version instead!",2

Sure, I could discard this protector and try the second one, bit I paid for 2 protectors, not one, and it probably will be the same. Very disappointing.",2

5474,feel ripped off to be honest its suppose to be an 8 litre pot when in actual face its a 6 litre pot and when i spoke to the company they said that the cooking capacity was 6 litres but the whole pot was 8 litre that to me is false advertising... the pot itself is a good pot shame about the manufacturers,2

5481,"Firstly I didn't realise the book was basically letters sent from and to various people - some on the Island and some not. So it took me a bit of getting into, however some of the descriptive passages painted a picture of the haves and have nots. After two or three chapters you started to understand the life the residents were going through, and how it progressively became more and more difficult for them - food shortages and having to watch how cruelly the foreign labourers were treated and they were mostly powerless to help. The literary society created a positive focus in their lives and the potato peel pie was something they conjured up and looked forward to. My lasting impression was that despite all through the long years - their spirit may have been sorely tested, but never broken.",2
5482,"Firstly to caveat my review, I've not had great luck with electronic shavers in the past. Some of my problems with this Braun are therefore probably just down to me. With Electronic ones I've always had to fall back to using a manual one otherwise I just end up with patches that the electronic one doesn't seem to touch, despite several runs over the area.That said, this Braun performs worse than the last couple I've had. I first tried it dry and the results were poor. Liking the feature of it being waterproof I tried it in the shower and although its more comfortable being able to use shaving foam, if anything the performance was a little worse. Its as though the blades are blunt (packaging was opened previously, so perhaps they are?) or the design is focused more on making sure it doesn't irritate the skin that the foil has such small holes that brizzles won't go through.Overall I have more luck with the rotary ones but I'm going back to a manual one. The 2 rather than 1 star is for Amazon who as usual are excellent on their returns policy.",2
5483,"Fitbit just can’t compete with the likes of Garmin and Apple here sadly.This Watch was hyped up and sounded great. Sadly it’s not as good a fitness watch as the likes of the Garmin Fenix series and others, nor is it as good a smart watch as the Apple Watch 3.The Fitbit looks and feels cheap.The display is nice and clear but in all truth if you’ve had one of Fitbit’s previous smart fitness watches it hardly anything new.I don’t think it’s worth £300. More like £150-200 tops. If it didn’t have the Fitbit name behind it I suspect it wouldn’t sell well at all.Bought this for the girlfriend. She’s used Garmin, Fitbit and Apple in the past. This has now been returned. She prefers Garmin’s fitness tracking as it’s more accurate and in depth information helps her train better and she prefers apple’s Apple Watch for its smart features.In short, this is a dull watch. It just has nothing special about it at all. Take a look at the top end of Garmin’s smart fitness watches if you want a fitness tracker and the Apple Watch if you want a smart watch.",2
5484,"Fits my phone well and is thick and responsive. However, I have only had it on a fortnight and it cracked in 5 different places. I've had to remove it and use the other one already. Not very good value for money compared to some of the other screen protectors that I have had",2

The usability is poor and cumbersome. My advice, buy them an iPad, it will be more expensive but at least you wont be tempted to throw it at the wall.3. Sound. Best get your children's ears cleaned, or they'll think they've gone deaf when using this devise.4. Speed. Apps can take, like the changing of the battery, an age to open and can sometimes close without warning.5.

I am quite careful with my phone, but like to have the extra protection. However, within a few weeks of having this ‘protector’ on my phone, my screen beneath, after a metres drop onto a wooden floor, cracked all over and I have had to send it off to be repaired since. £60 later I don’t think I’ll be buying these again and go for a more expensive but better quality version as previously.",2

5496,Found the suction wasn't strong enough. Ended up using manual pump instead,2
5497,"Frankly I couldn't get into it. I kept losing sight of the many characters. I think it is because it is written in the form of letters. Not the easiest of literary styles. I expect I'll enjoy the film better. And when I have seen it, I will go back to the book.",2
5498,Friends have liked this a lot but because it is all correspondence ands it never really took  my attention and I soon gave up.,2
5499,"From the two pack, the first glass protector had a round dot mark on it so that wasn't any good. The second one fit the screen and felt great, although I noticed the edge of the protector has a colourful outline (from the screen) which is distracting.

5510,Good idea and good quality but doesn't work. The material is too heavy for the suckers so it just falls off or droops down. Having it altered and hopefully it will work,2
5511,Good idea but why on earth they used hard plastic for the suction cups instead of the normal clear rubbery material - the cups don't stick to the window so it's really hard work putting it up and then it comes down after 10 mins - fail.,2
5512,Good product for look and feel but buggy and needs more support. Notifications erratic and fitbit pay not yet supported by any known U.K. Banks,2
5513,Good quality screen protector but note that it does not have an opening for the front facing camera. This can cause a very slight blur. Not fit for use in my opinion.,2
5514,"Good quality, but smaller than before! Rip off.",2
5515,Good screen protector. I was aware it would be smaller than the phone face due to the curve but I would have hoped that it at least went to the edge of the usable screen area in the width direction. It us just short and so the side lines can be distracting. Not the case on my brothers phone from a different company so it is possible.,2

The kids UI, whilst you have piece of mind regarding content, the content is pretty limited and the BIG issue is the UI. The resolution of the screen is poor and the design is from 10 ago... HUGE icons.The device itself is pretty underspeced - basically ok for watching films whilst traveling...many times the SD card is not recognised (mounting seems to be flakey).Overall I would buy a stock android Acer or Leveno tablet.",2

However my kid can still access ALL the blocked content (that is allowed by the age filter)  through the 'Characters' tab on his home screen. I caught him playing 'Angry Birds' this morning even though it was blocked. Yes, you can turn the internet off, but this isn't practical as he needs it for the educational 'Leapfrog' games he plays, and we can't sit over his shoulder ALL the time. On his home screen there are the three or four apps we installed plus loads of uninstalled content that he just has to tap on to download - no parental intervention needed. The Kindle has recently updated it's OS, so not sure if it's a bug with the new install, but this is a definite downer for us. 5 stars for the tablet itself, but overall this is a MAJOR glitch.",2

Then sometimes they drop out and all settings (passwords, network name) are lost.Support are quite quick and try to be helpful, but ultimately have never had a solution apart from replace.You may get on fine with them because I suspect many of the issues are dependent on the exact usage, wiring etc. But software issues are unlikely to be down to this. I've had other more basic issues with the utility (it doesn't save any of the settings until you close it), but TPLINK confirmed that they have no plans to release any updates.Some of the problems are down to the technology I think rather than any failing of TPLink. We're now switching to 802.11ac wifi  which is making these redundant. Probably more costly at the moment (especially if repeaters needed) but stonking speed and more reliable at the moment.",2
5549,"Had this product a year.Great holder in most respects as it will easily take any size phone and pushes into the vent, so conveniently sits by the dash as you drive.Downside is that with daily use, it starts to move around.The reason is the small rubber grips on the back of the holder come away from the metal arms.The rubber grips then disappear down your car vent never to be seen again.This leaves just the metal clips on the back of the holder, which won't grip anything vent shaped.Sadly disappointed as this was such a versatile holder until the rubber grips went walkabout.",2

5557,"Having been a wet shaver for many years I decided to buy a modern electric. I consulted Which? Which? gave Braun a score of 78% and the best model tested 79%. The Braun cost £40 the best £200. There seemed to be no sense in paying five times the price for essentially the same performance. I can't comment on the £200 model, but if the performance of the two is the same don't buy electric of any make.It does not shave close. It does not cut long hairs. To make any progress it is necessary to shave the same area repeatedly. Even then the shave is not 'clean'.",2

I wish the author had given Kit a more interesting hobby, as I found myself skipping sections of his chapters so I could avoid them.None of the characters were really likeable, but Jamie came across as a caricature bad guy. I know we weren't supposed to like or have sympathy for him, but the author laid it on with a trowel.A couple of reviewers said they guessed the twist early on, so I tried to keep my mind at a more superficial level so as not to have the surprise spoiled, and this worked. I had a suspicion about part of it, but didn't see the real twist coming until I got there. I've given it 2 stars because of this.",2

5563,"Honestly pretty disappointing as some of the cheaper electric razors I have bought are better. I'll admit that this one never catches on skin or leaves cuts, but it also doesn't give a particularly clean shave.There are better options on the market so I wouldn't bother if I were you.",2

5567,"I 'upgraded' from a Blaze to the Ionic..... and I have to say I'm really underwhelmed. SO far I've not seen any real improvement over the Blaze, especially for the very steep cost.For example, the touted 'Wallet' doesn't work with any UK banks. The weather app cannot have independent units from your settings of distance (i.e. for celsius to show, you have to select metres and kilometers as your distance unit - if you select miles, you get fahrenheit). There are no apps available for it, even though this is one of the big things FitBit have been pushing. And the watch faces are again quite limited.If you have a Blaze, I'd say it's not worth upgrading. For everyone else - wait for the sales!",2
5568,I agree with other reviewers that these wipes are difficult to pull out with one hand. Usually I get 2 or 3 wipes in one go unless the packet is held. This is not really safe when you always suppose to hold one hand on your baby and makes these wipes quite difficult to use once out and using high positioned changing tables in public places. Wettness of these wipes varies from wipe to wipe and is unevenly distibuted and they don't feel soft enough to be used on delicate baby's skin. Obviously they are also very cold compared to other wipes as they are mostly water which it is worth to be aware of. Another low point is the price once not on offer. Not that impressed overall.,2
5569,I agree with others. Having used water wipes since birth they are no longer as wet and quite coarse in texture. I certinly won't be using them again and have reverted to using reusable wipes from itti bitti ultimate cloth wipes which are made of velour and fantastic. A shame really because old 72 packs were fabulous from birth and new 60 packs are rubbish and really harsh on the bottom,2
5570,"I am giving TP-LINK TL-WPR4220 AV500 Powerline a two star rating for one specific reason; its not compatible with Google's Chromecast.Prior to purchasing the TL-WPR4220 I had a TL-PA6030 Powerline unit plugged into a socket in our sitting room so that I could connect up our PVR and BluRay Player to our router, and that worked fine.  However, since we suffered some wi-fi signal degradation in the same room and relocating the main router wasn't really an option I thought I would swap the PA6030 for the WPR4220.  Having done so I set the WPR4220 to mimic our router SSID and everything seemed to be working fine.  The wired connections all worked and wi-fi signal strength in the sitting room did improve.However, then the problems began.  At first I assumed it was a fault with the Chromecast, which started regularly disconnecting from the phones and tablets being used to control it (something it had never done before) and either refusing to reconnect or vanishing entirely from the network.  Rebooting it or the App you were trying to 'Cast' sometimes fixed the problem, but not always.  It started to get really frustrating, to the point where I began looking at alternatives to the Chromecast.Then, out of idle curiosity I did a web search under 'TP-Link, wi-fi, Chromecast issues' and discovered from various forums (including TP-LINK's own) that this is a common issue with the TP-LINK's wi-fi enabled Powerline units.  Apparently they simply can't communicate reliably with the Chromecast, resulting in the latter periodically disappearing from home networks, and so far TP-LINK have not offered any sort of firmware update to resolve the problem.I'm aware that this is a very specific issue that will not be encountered by everyone, but since the one thing I bought the TL-WPA4220  to do it does badly, and everything else it does my old  TL-PA6030 could also do, it pretty much makes the new unit a waste of money.  For that reason I really can only give it two stars at best.",2
5571,"I am pleased that fitbit have finally come up with a watch that does everything my garmin used to it.

Once again fitbit have boxed themselves in with only been able to upload music from a computer and not so much as preset text response.

I bought the Ionic Adidas version as I am a long-time Fitbit user (this is my third device) and an avid runner so delighted to see a GPS-enabled product in the Fitbit universe. Very easy to set up, lovely to look at and use. However!: During my first run 2 days after I received it, 80% charged, it turned off. So I reset and recharged and it was fine for 3 more days. After that it has turned off more times than I can remember, during normal use, during sleep, during exercise etc. I wasn't expecting this after the investment made but from checking on-line, it's a known bug. It's a shame as it's a nice device but let down by glitchy hardware. I have returned the unit to Amazon for a full refund after one weel and have bought a Garmin instead.

5593,"I decided to buy Ionic after using Charge 2 which is a perfect device for tracking the activity. I upgraded to Ionic mainly because of 1. water resistant feature 2. music player 3. built in GPS 4. AppI must say all these features let me down, except GPS - I didn't get enough time to test it. My Fitbit Ionic broke down after using it less than one and half day. Here is my story: 1. Ionic is meant to be water resistant. After swimming for about 15 mins, when I checked the screen, I saw Fitbit logo on the screen. I didn't know what that was, so I continued my activity. After the swimming session, the screen was blank. I tried pressing the buttons, but didn’t get any response. I checked online forums for tips and tried everything suggested there - long press left + bottom right button, long press all three buttons, charge it and do that again etc. No luck. 2. Transferring music to the player was not an easy task. It took me more than 2 hours figure out how to use Fitbit PC app and once I figured out, it took more than 2 hours to transfer 100 audio file. I ran out of patients so I stopped after 20 mins.3. I cannot comment on GPS.4. I know Fitbit are working on it, but the apps are pretty primitive. I was specially annoyed with Fitbit pay as only 2 Banks from the UK was listed and none of them are high-street banks.I didn’t get any added value for the premium price I paid.

5596,"I didn't buy mine from Amazon, but a high street catalogue store, after my Philips Sonicare died after a good few years of use. I found the brush head on the Philips a shade large to use so thought I'd try one of these instead. As many other reviewers have said there are a lot of extras in the box with the oral b that you probably won't use or need; the travel case is nice, the timer is a useful bathroom clock (but not needed for toothbrushing as the unit vibrates to indicate it's time to move on to brushing the next quadrant and if you brush in the mirror you can see the red lights come on if you use to much pressure) and the brush head selection is a bit unnecessary. It takes ages to charge and the battery runs down quickly, and although the brush head itself is smaller in terms of diameter it is deeper than my old toothbrush and the handle chunkier, so presents its own new set of challenges. Most importantly though my teeth do not feel anything like as clean as when using a sonic toothbrush (I've had a couple of brands over the years) - I'm sure the oral b seems like a noticeable improvement in cleanliness when going from a manual toothbrush, but definitely feels like trading down from a sonic type. After about 6 weeks of use I've bought a new sonic toothbrush.  Feels like it was a total waste of money to me I'm afraid.",2

5609,"I feel bad criticising a book whose author died shortly after completing it but I agree with all the comments made by those who wrote the 1 and 2 star reviews. The irony is that I think the author herself partly knew the reasons why the book couldn't work. Sidney, the publisher, tells Juliet that a collection of anecdotes wouldn't do for a book. Well, basically I think this is what we have here, and not very coherent or fluid anecdotes at that. Many have commented on the similar tone of voice of the characters; I imagined them all speaking with a sort of Cornish accent! Other epistolary books have worked well for me, e.g. 'e', 'Salmon Fishing in the Yemen' and of course '84, Charing Cross Road'. Sadly, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society did not work for me. The other distraction was the dates on the letters-the postal system must have exceeded email in its speed and the characters must have spent most of their time writing! Having said that-perhaps there is a novel here, told by one person, from Guernsey.",2

5632,"I have always been of the Tony Hancock school of thought - ""You can't beat the cold steel and the badger. All this electrical rubbish, little wheels spinning about all over the place, for callow youths and peach fluff. Not for a man's beard. Razor blades - for men."" I have never come across a razor coming anywhere near the ""cold steel"" for a smooth finish, though technology is clearly improving and some I have tried are markedly better than years ago.When I received this I hadn't shaved for 3 days, perfect to try out the claim of ""proven on 3 day beards"". This was frankly a failure and there was so much stubble left I had to get the razor out to finish off. On subsequent shaves I found that I wasn't getting as good a finish as far less expensive models I have tried. One thing which does improve the shave quite considerably though is rubbing a couple of drops of shave oil such as Somersets shaving oil onto the skin first. The instructions advise not washing the face before shaving, and if you do so it's harder to move the foil smoothly across the skin and the finish is less good - clearly it needs some skin oil present which would otherwise get washed off, but shave oil is even better. The instructions make no mention that I could see of shave oil one way or the other. Even if I do manage to get an acceptable finish I find that I can feel stubble again within a couple of hours of shaving or even less, not something I experience with the blade.There is an attachment for trimming sideburns which is quite frankly rubbish for a device of this price range.The razor charges quite quickly in its base unit, around an hour to fully charge from empty, and the charge lasts ages - the claim is 50 minutes; I haven't tested it exactly but this seems about right.The unique selling point of this is its cleaning system built into the base unit. It contains a cartridge which washes and dries the foil - the process takes about 40 minutes and can be fairly noisy. The razor itself has an indicator which shows when the razor ""needs"" to be cleaned, but as far as I can tell this just lights up every time you have switched on the razor for a certain amount of time and I doubt very much that there is any cleverness about this as might be implied. The cleaning system is indeed very impressive, but you can get it clean enough as far as I can tell just from removing the foil and running the parts under the tap for ten seconds and leaving to dry. Perhaps this is for the busy executive who doesn't have the time even for that. It's not clear if the automated cleaning in some way improves the lifetime of the foil but I suspect not given the instructions say to replace the foil unit every 18 months which seems a standard interval.When you add up the initial cost of this shaver, the cost of cleaner cartridges (which are supposed to last about 3 weeks each with a daily clean I think) and a replacement foil every 18 months, plus possibly the addition to your electric bill with the base unit whirring about for 40 minutes a day it becomes a bit of an expensive way to shave, especially when the finish is still not nearly as good as the cold steel and the badger.[EDIT: After several more frustrating days of use of this I am downgrading my rating from 3 to 2 stars due to the seeming inability to ever get a good enough finish with this product and even where it does feel reasonably smooth it's rough again within an hour as though it's just pushing stubble root down which quickly pops back again. I've had far, far better results with a 40-quid or so Philips.]",2
5633,"I have always used Braun products and bought this on a friend's recommendation. He loves his and says the wet or dry shave feature makes all the difference.I tried mine wet to start with and on a couple of days growth it was pathetic!  The following day I tried it dry and after much patient work my face was whisker free. To say it does not work as well as my old one is a major understatement.It charges quickly and seems to hold it's charge well too.  After much thought I booked a return pick up.  My friend said ""you have to give it time, you have to persevere, you'll see, you'll love it.""So I didn't send it back, I DID persevere and guess what?  I STILL don't love it. But now I am stuck with it. I did not want one that self cleans and I thought that a hundred quid for a razor was ridiculous so I guess this one will have to do for now, but beware.....it does NOT shave well, it is NOT a quick shave and it is NOT better or even good when used wet, it is only poor when used dry, if you use it wet it is, at best, very poor indeed.It will not shave you clean in one go unless you spend about an hour shaving and re-shaving to catch all the hairs that it misses on the first shave and the next one.This will be the LAST time I listen to THAT friend's opinion!!",2
5634,"I have been a big fan of Oral B electric toothbrushes and decided to try the Pro 6000.  I read the reviews and did see there were some negative ones, but I tried it nonetheless.  I have now tried two different Pro 6000 over the space of 3 months,  My experience with these is that it does NOT match Braun's description.  The problems I had were:1. It takes a ludicrously long time to charge and re-charge fully.  I do not like (and have never had to with other Oral-B models) leaving any electric  toothbrush on permanent charge so when it did need re-charging it always took at least 24 hours to do so - far far too long.2. It does not hold its charge for 10 days as advertised - not even close.  With normal use I was lucky to get 4 days charge out of it.  I always got at least 7 days out of past Oral B models.3. It gives NO warning that it needs to be recharged.  It just stops dead.  The 3 bar lights should give me the heads up but when it lost charge it variously showed 3 or 2 lit bars and only once a single lit bar.Perhaps the bluetooth communicating it does with the Oral B app may be the problem.  Who needs their toothbrush talking to their phone??  I didn't have the app (didn't want it) so I wonder if it was munching through its battery scanning for it.  I now understand the negative reviews and will not buy this again.  It has also shaken my faith in Oral B.",2
5635,"I have been disappointed as I had read reviews and had high expectations. It is awkward to fit, does not stay well on the window, despite being clean. I would not recommend",2
5636,"I have been using Oral B for quite a few years, unfortunately I did not read the reviews on this brush, assuming that because its Oral B the name speaks for it self.  I could not understand why the battery kept needing recharging after 3 months.  I seriously thought it was something I was doing as you don't expect Oral B to produce such an inferior product and having spent so much money as well.  I went abroad and my tooth brush would not charge but my husband's tooth brush which was allot cheaper did charge.  I have to say I am very disappointed with this product, I am constantly charging my tooth brush and am reluctant  to throw it out having spent so much money.  Same on you Oral B for taking hard earned money for you loyal customers knowing this products was faulty.",2
5637,"I have been using these wipes for the last 6 months.  I just received another box of 12.  I noticed the size of the packaging changed.  It's now similar size and shape to the brand P.  I compared the size of the individual wipes.  Wow, they actually reduced the length of the sheet by about an inch.  Did anyone else notice this?  I just can't believe they would change the product like this.",2
5638,"I have been using this shaver for a while now.It isn't very good. My 3 Day beard takes 44 MINUTES to get fully clean shaven using this shaver. I don't have that kind of time in the mornings!!!It also leaves my skin feeling very tender and sensitive, it doesn't feel good.If your beard grows under your chin, run away now. No matter how many times I run this thing over my neck the hairs will still stay!This is more designed for people who have less hair on their face. It will take three tries to simply shave some patches!!If you're someone who barely has any facial hair - go for it.If you're someone who has quite thick facial hair - don't.Don't get me started on that trimmer on the back. It's a joke.Disappointed with Braun.",2
5639,"I have been using Water Wipes for 18 months and have loved them. This is the first time I have ordered the wipes from Amazon and having purchased a 12 pack of these wipes a couple of months ago, once opened, each pack had a very strong smell of mould/mildrew within a couple of days of being opened. Each pack is the same. They are well within their use by date and I have never had this problem before but it is very off putting. I will be writing to Water Wipes to complain.",2
5640,"I have had a subscription of these wipes for 19 months, and have to say that they have been excellent. My baby has not had any nappy rash and the lack of chemicals mean that I've been happy to use them from day 1, and on his face and hands too. So why two stars? Because my last box of wipes was more expensive, but had smaller wipes which seem to be lower quality (they come out of the packet in clumps rather than singly, so you use more or have to fiddle around putting them back, and the edges are frilly and fall apart). The time has come to stop using them I fear, and hope that the quality is improved if we ever have a second child.",2
5641,"I have had several of these through the house. They were easy to set up and worked pretty reliably....However......We started to develop some problems with my home network. HP OfficeJet printer kept on vanishing off the network. At first this could sometimes be resolved by deleting and re-installing the printer, or moving from wired to wireless. After a while, these workarounds stopped working too.I looked this up online, and there seems to be a known issue where the protocols used on these devices do not allow the HP Officejet printers to be woken up properly over the network. I found several people with the same problem, and none of their temporary solutions worked. Removed the TP-LINK kit, replaced with some LinkSys/Cisco gear - no problem now at all.",2
5642,I have had the screen protector on for 10 days now and I have 4 chips around the edge and 2 cracks. This is with a phone case on as well so the edges are not exactly exposed. Compared to other glass protectors this screen protector is definitely thinner and a lot more brittle,2
5643,I have had to send my second one back as a result of time it took to charge  and the life it actually had after a significant charge.  I would charge it up over night and the brush would last me and my two children at most three days - if that .,2
5644,I have to constantly turn these units on and off in order to re-establish network connections. It's a real problem because I have a few of these devices scattered around the house and I don't really know which of them is the problem. All I know is that if I turn them all off and back on again my problems disappear (for a while).,2
5645,I have used it on my iPhone 6s and initially it seemed fine but only a day later I noticed two parallel lines appeared on both sides of the screen protector. May be some adhesive problem. Some other reviews also pointed it out.Very disappointed as it had very high reviews.Would not recommend this product.,2
5646,"I honestly cannot understand why the reviews are so good for this product. Having just fitted an Anker screen protector on my iPhone 6s after a long debate between Anker or Jetech I had high hopes for a similar experience. When my mum text me and asked if I could fit one on her 6s as the last one needed replacing I opted for this 2-pack due to the fact she is far less careful than I.Yes you do get 2 for the same price as 1 when compared to Anker however, Anker's was bundled with a much better fitting kit including rubbing alcohol to clean the screen, two types of cloth and proper alignment stickers. In this pack you get a cloth, a sticker (dust removal) and 2 x alignment stickers.The actual glass protector itself has a tab to remove the protective layer revealing an adhesive layer. The instructions on the back of the box did NOT match where the tab actually was on the screen protector. I then tried out the dust removing sticker which went horribly. First it tore when I tried to peel it off and then when I had done so it curled up to the point where it was almost useless. When applying the protector Jetech recon its best to just drop it on your phone and hope the bubbles sort themselves out. This didn't go to plan. Despite my best efforts there were two huge bubbles which refused to come out and being the perfectionist I am, I chose to try again with the 2nd protector. Anker suggest sticking the two tabs on the side of your phone and kind of folding it over as if you are closing a book which is much more effective IMO.This time round went slightly better after ignoring the instructions provided. There was another large bubble which I eventually manged to get rid of bar a few tiny bubbles which were left over. Hopefully they will come out over time but none of this was helped by the fact there was no tool included to remove bubbles after applying, just a warranty card which had they made slightly thicker would work for this purpose. Finally, with screen protector in place I admired my efforts only to find that the cut of the screen protector wasn't right and there was a gap. Not the normal gap you'd get due to the curvature of the phone but it didn't even cover the entirety of the LCD. I don't know if this is just my bad luck and a one-off or if all of them are manufactured like this but either way Jetech sort your s*** out.Moral of the review is don't buy this product... get the single Anker one and save yourself the unnecessary stress.",2
5647,"I joined the water wipe hype. I like the idea of them, but really they could be slightly wetter!... Useless for poo!",2
5648,I just could not get on with this book.,2
5649,I know it has to fit anywhere but far too big and kept falling down so wouldn't recommend for my use!,2
5650,"I know it's been three years, but it hasn't been used every day and only ever for paper cutting, but it is now completely blunt - therefore useless.  You have to keep the plastic pressed right down to get a decent cut.  Not really up to the job if you ask me!",2
5651,I know nobody will believe on my review but I always use Hair Tweezers after Braun Series 9 9095CC shave.,2
5652,i liked the theory of not having to use cotton wool/water but the wipes are really thick and impossible to pull out with one hand so I found them really difficult to use.  didnt buy them again and used cotton wool and then pampers sensitive wipes instead.  rather overrated item and I wouldnt recommend.,2
5653,"I love that these only contain two ingredients, and I have been very loyal to this wipe for that reason, but that is really the only thing going for them. It's especially difficult to stomach the fact that not only are they so much more expensive than other wipes for being mostly water, but they have just changed the packaging to a cheaper material, and I have already ripped open two packs on accident (out of 4 used). I guess it's understandable to want to make a bit more money, but naturally at a cost to the consumer. We buy these because we want the best for our babies, and so are at disadvantage!",2
5654,I might be being unfair as I don't use electric shavers and now know why. I have always wet shaved but was getting fed up of the same chore every morning so tried this based upon the reviews.I suspect for me all electric shavers may be the same and leave patches of bristles however hard you try. Thankfully it was relatively inexpensive and therefore the confirmation that for me wet shaving seems to be the only option hasn't cost me a lot.,2
5655,I needed 3 so bought two boxes of two. One failed after a month and I think another is about to!,2
5656,"I normally use the Huggies Pure, and I thought about given those a try as they are 99.9% water, as Amazon stopped the Save and Subscribe on the Huggies. I found myself very disappointed. The texture is harsh to the touch and they don't clean my baby's bum. I have to use several to get the job done and even so, I still have to finish with the Mustella lotion and a cotton pad to make sure everything has been removed.I am now stuck with a stock of those that I will use for cleaning her hands only.",2
5657,"I only managed to get through this book by skipping massive chunks of it - most of the bits about Kit when he was away from home - and skim reading the rest. I wanted to know what happened but couldn't be bothered to plough through the boring bits, of which there were far too many. As other reviewers have said, the characters were an unlikeable bunch and unless there is at least one person to root for it makes reading hard work. I approached this book with gritted teeth and a determination to finish rather than an eager desire to read and I was thankful to get to the end. It has lots of good reviews so it is obviously to lots of readers tastes but certainly not mine.",2
5658,"I only notice on packing that this item is a photo trimmer where what I really needed is something that can take 4-5 sheets paper.  However, I did try to trim a photo with it and it couldn't cope - I had to do it with scissors",2
5659,I ordered these for spare and only today needed to use one to find that it was slightly smaller than my actual screen. Not a great fit but had them to long to ask for them to be replaced. Bit disappointed.,2
5660,I ordered two of these and both failed to stay on the windows. The suckers stuck for a few hours but they were all in bent positions when not on the window and eventually returned to their shape and fell off. Tried in various positions and moved around but gave up after four attempts and returned them.  Quite frustrating really for a sucker-stuck black-out blind; there's really only two functions to get right and one of them failed.,2
5661,"I purchase this product twice, they were leaking water every time when I receive them.",2
5662,"I purchased the Oral -B PRO 6000 after reading the customer reviews. Our old Philips Electric toothbrush finally stopped working after 10 years.I am in my 50's and love keeping fit, and teeth hygiene is very important to me and my wife. We have been trying this Oral B for nearly 1 year before writing this review.After reading lots of reviews we thought that we would try the Oral B.I noticed that high speed setting is much slower than the old Philips one I had. Like me if you visit the Dentist Regular their teeth cleaning brush rotates at a very high speed. I find that I have to use the brush 3 times at least in one go, to give me the teeth clean I had with the old Philips toothbrush. The other speed setting are a GIMMICK. Brushes wear out too quickly, and are too expensive.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS EXPENSIVE PRODUCT AND DISAGREE WITH THE REVIEWS. QUALITY DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE LIKE THE HIGH SPEED PHILIPS TOOTHBRSH THAT I ONCE HAD.",2
5663,"I purchased these elsewhere but used Amazon for research so will leave a review here to help others.They do the job, very easy to set up and have worked perfectly.Lost stars as these are advertised as 600 Mbps. This would be physically impossible as the ethernet ports on them are only 10/100 and not gigabit, so the max speed achievable is 100 Mbps. I noticed this when connecting to my gigabit switch as it indicated the link as 10/100. Checked the box and its in very small print on the back, nowhere on the front where 600 Mbps is blazoned onto the box. No little * either with small print to indicate this clear mis-selling on TP Link's part.I do get the 100 Mbps dl/ul across them, but a 300 Mbps internet connection is going to waste. My internal network speed is unaffected as these were only providing a link from my switch to the modem in another room. Email sent to TP Link to ask why they are mis-selling these, I await a response with bated breath!",2
5664,I purchased this about a year ago and Had no complaints about the quality of shave. However I'm now finding that I am having to recharge every second day....and that is after following the manufacturers instructions on battery maintenance. I don't think that the L-Ion batteries are up to the job. I used to get 3-4 years out of Ni-Mh batteries before replacement.,2
5665,"I purchased this book based on good reviews. What were these people reading that had left glowing reviews? This book must rate as the slowest book ever. I truly mean ever. Slow is an understatement. I only pursued it because I kept thinking it'll pick up pace soon. Sadly it didn't. The harping on about the eclipse was beyond boring. In fact the whole story was stupid.It started to pick up pace 3/4 of the way through but then didn't continue with a storyline that was so thrilling you were enthralled.I rated it 2 stars ..... one for me actually bothering to finish it and one for the book.Don't be mislead by thinking this ""gripping Sunday Times thriller"" is good. It isn't. It's dire. Truly dire.Books like this should offer a refund to the buyer! I want my money back.",2
5666,"I purchased this shaver as it's advertised as being a top seller and is reasonably priced, however I do not think this is a very good product. It shaves ok around the cheeks, but underneath the chin leaves stubble behind no matter how many times you go over it, which in turn causes irritation. Quite disappointed as I based this purchase on all the positive reviews.",2
5667,"I purchased water wipes after hearing all the great reviews, however I am not a fan. I find them way too wet and heavy - almost as if i could ring them out, which isn't always helpful when trying to clean up a newborns poo! They are however useful to have during the first few weeks and during the stay in hospital as they are the only wipes nurses/midwives approve of as they are so natural and that meant no faffing around with cooled boiled water and cotton pads!",2
5668,"I really dislike books that take the form of letters going back and forth between people. I find them a bit confusing at times and the story becomes quite stilted, thus losing a plot that could be forming. This very author uses a line in this very book to say that a whole lot of anecdotes does not a good story make.However, I was urged to read this by a friend who could not stop raving about it and so I set to it one day when I was at the end of my tether with a run of bad reads. There has not been a book I have read in quite some time that has rendered me unable to put it down, with the exception of books I re-read to review here.This inventory of letters was okay. Average. Nothing I would recommend in a hurry. A bunch of people invent a literary society in Occupied Guernsey and so set forth their tale of how they came to be. It is interesting to get a perspective of the war that is neither German or Jewish, true, but that was probably all. To be quite honest, it all sounded rather romanticised, with the concentration camp part thrown in as though the author thought ""Oh dash! I must make the war sound more evil!"" It took me several days to finish this book - I think a good couple of weeks. That is unusual for me. I usually tear through a good book in two days maximum. This was obviously not a good book.I toyed with rating it three stars but ended up with a stronger two because in my mind, paying for a less-than-average read is not such a great idea. I would recommend that anyone wishing to read this book borrows it from a library or a friend or just goes for something with a little more substance.",2
5669,I really don't like it.,2
5670,"I really like using this toothbrush and wish I had bought an electric one years ago. Why the negative review then? This particular model doesn't do even half the things it promises in the marketing spiel.6 modes - only 2 work Daily Clean and Whitening. This could have been as I had initially chosen ""whitening journey"", which disabled all other modes. However even after ending that journey, nothing changed, can still only use daily clean or whitening. I bought this model because - as a heavy brusher - I liked the idea of using the Sensitive mode regualrly. I obviously can't do that now.Pressure Monitor - must be gauged at 3000kg pressure. To make it kick in you have to really dig into your teeth...App that coaches you - no it doesn't. It simply records the time you brush for and reminds you to clean your toungue (for which I obviously cannot use the dedicated mode), floss and rinse.Very disappointed, could have saved myself a good £30/40 and bought a basic model instead.",2
5671,"I really wanted to like this book. Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't put off by the title (although I suspect the potato peel pie was invented to enhance the title rather than the plot). But what a disappointment! I simply fail to understand the  novel's popularity. It is remorselessly dull, lacks a strong storyline, is broken up into a myriad letters, diaries, telgrams etc, and for much of the time, seems to be going nowhere. There are far too many characters - some only referred to occasionally, so that it's hard to keep track of them - and I didn't even think it was particularly well-written. As the author herself writes: ""Strings of anecdotes don't make a book....facts,as interesting as they are, seem like random scattered shots."" Quite. I managed to finish the novel - just - but, sadly I cannot  recommend it.",2
5672,"I really wanted to love these wipes and the idea of them being completely natural and no chemicals is great and of course you pay for this, however.... I don't mind paying for quality often you get what you pay for, but with these wipes i am having the problem of 3/4 coming out for the packet when i want one and trying to put them back in.  Also i find they are very wet infact so much so that i have to dry the baby bottom off after wiping otherwise its too wet to put a nappy on.  Such a shame as i really wanted to love this product but not for me.",2
5673,"I recently bought this to replace my old Braun shaver whose power switch stopped working. Having liked the old shaver, I had high expectations on this one and the great reviews it had received on Amazon seemed to indicate it in fact was a good shaver.After using it for a couple of months now, I must say I am disappointed. The quality of the shave is uneven leaving individual hairs sticking out of your face no matter how many times you try to shave them. In general, will need to shave the same spots again and again to get them look anywhere acceptable and still, if you brush the back of your hand on your face, you will feel that the cut isn't very precise with your face still feeling sharp.Considering you don't get a good shave even when you have to spend at least twice as much time shaving, I'd say this is not worth the money. I've since started using the old Braun (just got to let the battery run out after every shave -- it is still faster this way!) and do wet shaves whenever I have time for it.",2
5674,"I stayed off electric razors for many years as I have never had a good one.  I,m never going to pay £100 to find out they are all useless what ever the price. So foolishly I tried this Braun to see if such machines had improved.  Nope! Bad as ever, dosen't give any type of close shave, and the more you try the sorer the skin gets.  Sorry to be so negative, but it just ain't any good.",2
5675,"I suspect that if you shaved every day religiously this shaver would be acceptable. However if like me you are a bit less regimented I would seriously give this a miss. I bought based on the ""3 day beard"" capabilities (and I am not a hairy individual), and the performance was closer to that of an orbital sander!!",2
5676,"I think it's aimed at an adolescent readership, it really is too childish for adults.  The big shocks just didn't happen.  It was obvious from the outset who burned the flat down, etc. as there was really no one else around who could have done it.  The excessively neurotic characters got royally on my nerves and the story is boring, overworked and predictable.",2
5677,"I though I'd like this - I've been after a pressure cooker for years and finally got this when there was a discount. But it's just not very good.It has lots of functions, but doesn't deliver any of them well. As a rice cooker, the rice is usually undercooked or a gloopy mess - and sticks to the pot!. It's impossible to steam without pressure. The whole thing is so limiting.I can produce better results for everything this claims to do with a slow cooker and a saucepan (with the exception of cooking at pressure)I'll be throwing this out (I wouldn't want to inflict it on any one else, and I'm sadly past the return period), and getting a traditional 'on the stove' pressure cooker to complement my saucepans and slow cooker.",2
5678,"I thought I would try this, as I'd grown tired of the increasing cost of wet shave razor cartridges. I have a tricky combo of sensitive skin and tough stubble. It had good reviews here and on Which? In fairness, I've not dry shaved for years but I was shocked at how bad a shave it gives. Whether used wet or dry, it takes ages to get anywhere near total shave coverage and it still leaves patches of stubble. The result is heat build-up which translates into skin irritation. So I'm left with a poor shave and red irritated skin. Not impressed! Now I'm left with a razor which I cannot use. Back to wet shaving, I fear.",2

5683,"I throughly enjoyed the first part of this novel, where a book society reviews books that are no longer fashionable, and that many people will not have heard of. It then becomes a standard chick-lit novel, which is interesting if you are unaware of Guernsey's wartime history. However, what annoyed me is that this is another novel where 21st century sensibilities are imposed on people of the past. The people of those days would not be kind and tolerant to a women who had a child out of wedlock, especially with an enemy soldier whose army was trying to kill their menfolk.",2
5684,I took the old one off because it was chipped and put this one on. It does not adhere properly around the edges and cut outs. I know what I'm doing as I have used screen protectors on all my i devices and having worked for Apple I have probably put hundreds on in my time. It's just not very good quality. Very disappointed.,2
5685,"I trusted the wisdom of over 1000 five star reviews and bought one of these in a moment of frustration after cutting myself wet shaving. The inconvenience of stemming the blood flow before I could put a shirt on was motivation for me to buy the best rated electric shaver I could find.Initially I was pleased with this shaver, however, it never shaved particularly close on my neck, no matter how much I stretched my skin tight and ran the shaver against the direction of stubble growth. Sure, I avoided cuts but I didn't feel well groomed. I find the noise and vibration of the thing buzzing away but not shaving me close enough really irritating – literally, my skin gets sore from the shaver's pathetic attempts to remove my stubble. Varying the speed and pressure applied make little difference.The big positive though is the trimmer which gets rid of unwanted ear and nostril hair and is pretty effective tidying up my eyebrows.In frustration, I've gone back to wet shaving with a multi-blade razor – this shaver doesn't get as close as day-old stubble from a wet shave. If I don't shave over the weekend, I go over my face first with the Braun then wet shave to get a neat, well-groomed look.If you've only ever used an electric shaver this could be perfect for you, however, if you're looking to switch from wet shaving with a multi-blade razor then don't waste your money.",2
5686,I understand it can't cover the whole screen due to the curve of the iPhone but there is a 1-2mm air gap on both sides of the screen which dust sticks too..,2
5687,I use these all the time as my little girl has sensitive skin... The product is brilliant.This time I have purchased a box of twelve and at least half of the packets are ripped forcing the wipes to dry out. These are not a cheap option for wipes and I have tried to ask for a replacement through Amazon but they want me to return the damaged wipes of my own accord... I paid £7.99 next day delivery for these so I am not paying to send them back as well.Would say the product is amazing but be careful ordering them through Amazon.,2

5693,"I wanted to write a review about this because I don't think it lives up to the reviewsI found this shaver to be very different from most. It feels very smooth when in use, almost like rubbing an ordinary electric shaver across your skin when it's turned off. However, the quality of the shave isn't very good - it doesn't get as close as an ordinary electric shaver and the trimmer function barely works at all. Plus, it takes about 3 times as long to shave with this shaver as with an ordinary one. And afterwards, I'm cut (which isn't normally the case). Disappointed",2
5694,"I was excited about getting this Pot but sadly found it disappointing and fiddly - so much so that I put it away in a cupboard after using it once and haven't bothered with it since.  I may have been doing something wrong, in which case can anyone enlighten me, but I couldn't get the steam valve set properly.  It didn't slide into position in the way described in the manual and needed to be manipulated more than seemed right.  Consequently, more steam escaped than it should have, making the kitchen steamy and the cooking process too slow.  All-in-all, there was too much hassle, and the recipe I tried (one from the booklet that came with the machine) would have been easier and quicker cooked in the traditional way.",2
5695,I was expecting it better but it was good that the battery would last a long time without the need for electricity and cut it to the hair good for its price but unfortunately I bought it without extra accessories,2
5696,"I was impressed by other reviews as I have a beard and I was looking for something to shave just my neck. I thought to buy this gadget to replace the the other razors with blades. It doesn't ""clean shave the neck"" just trim it, so if you are looking for a fine line around your neck this is not the product for you.",2
5697,"I was keen to try the Instant Pot, also based on the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, mine arrived with scratches and stains on the handles and the plastic cover and rims. I found the plastic around the rim of the pot to be of poor quality considering the price of the item. I have returned mine.",2
5698,"I was looking for a (time-saving) alternative to my trusted (5 year-old) Remington. The Braun looked just like the ticket based upon the good reviews, the brand's reputation, and a special deal on Prime. However, now using it (or trying to, to be more precise) for a few weeks I can confidently say that it is not the solution I have been looking for. This is due to multiple reasons. First, your beard needs to be short to take advantage of the system. The shaver couldn't cope with my 3-day beard, it was painful, took forever, and the shave still wasn't close. I thought I will give it a second try only a day later. While the result was better, the shave still wasn't clean, especially in the lower neck, chin, and under the nose areas. Additionally, the cleaning process is laborous to get it really clean. Given that I didn't want a shaver that requires a. daily use, and b. lots of time and effort, I cannot recommend this product. Moreover, if Braun offers a rechargeable product one might think customers will use it for their travels. So, why not include a travel bag? After all, the MSRP is £69.00.",2
5699,I was so disappointed in this book.  It didn't flow at all.  And I couldn't work out who was who as it was so disjointed.  Just a load of letters from different people to each other. And making a huge effort to be witty and amusing but failing dismally in my opinion.  Can't see what all the rave reviews are about.  I'm giving it two stars as there was one or two amusing lines.  Otherwise pretty dire.,2
5700,"I was up and running in under 10 mins. Simple to install, far easier than my last set of Devolo 1200 DLAN powerlines, which I remember took a while to set up.*Update* - 1 week in and I'm having drop-out problems. I have been changing the WiFi channel to no avail, which causes the adapters to stop receiving Internet for some reason and requiring a reset. All in all too much of a faff - sending back to to try another solution",2
5701,"I was very impressed with this trimmer on day one, but not so much much now, so lets go down to business.Pros: the trimmer is very small and ideal for travel, the small size does not effect performance. The battery life is excellent, but it is difficult to tell how long it lasts, as there is no indicator of juice level and I did not want to get caught short in the middle of a haircut. I am a boldie with sensitive skin, so can not use razors or electric shavers, trimmers are my only option, so I bought this based on the advert and some good reviews. Without the guard, this trimmer gives you the closest trim ever, that is comparable to electric shaver, but without the burn and a rash - very impressive. The guards work well and you get even trim of any length you want.Cons: as already said, the lack of battery level indicator, what were you thinking Philips? I bought this because I wanted to travel with it without the bulk of a big trimmer and a charger, but with this, you can not leave the charger at home and risk it randomly dies in hotel bathroom with half of your haircut done. The biggest problem is however, that the blade goes blunt after about 2 weeks of moderate use, it will start pulling, which means it is time to replace the blade for a new one. Considering the cost of blade replacement on at least monthly basis, this reasonably priced shaver suddenly works out as a really expensive toy. This makes little sense to own one.",2
5702,"I wasn't mad on all the jumping around between the past and the present, though I know it seems to be the trendy thing to do these days. I found the characters pretty unbelievable. The final denouement was about as exciting as a wet weekend. I have read much better books in my time.",2
5703,I would not recommend this product! The rubber parts on the clip which attach to the car have all fallen off. This has now completely scratched my car (the fans) and I am not impressed!,2
5704,"I'd been hankering after one of these since they came out and finally the wife got me one as a birthday present. The idea was to replace my fitbit HR and smartwatch with just one device.  I'd read all the reviews and thought I'd done enough research - but gave up on this after two days.  Why?  Well although the device is good looking and exactly the right size for my wrist - not absurdly oversized like my smartwatch - you can't reply to any messages or send even the simplest text with it.  My smartwatch could do that, so easily that I took it for granted.  Using voice dictation is a great way to send texts safely while driving, and the Ionic simply can't do that.ALSO approximately half the time the screen did not come on when I raised my hand to check the time, so I had to push a button.  Yeah! A watch you need two hands to use! Like those first digital Timex ones from the 1970s! On top of that, the alarm was easy to set, but always went off exactly ten minutes after the time I specified... A minor bug I'm sure could be fixed in firmware... but it wont make any difference to me, because I've stopped using mine.EDIT: Wore it on a trip abroad because I was worried about my smartwatch getting nicked.  After four days without a charge the Ionic battery showed 40%.  Credit where credit is dues, the battery life is amazing.  Pity (a) it takes a specialised charger and (b) I can't swap some of that amazing battery life for an always-on display of the time, even in a low-power mode like Android smartwatches have...",2
5705,I'm a wet shaver. I thought about giving a try to a good quality electric shaver.I used to shave against and cross the grain and to have a very smooth feeling.

5706,"I'm afraid I almost gave it one star.Editors! Where were you when this dull book was crying out for your gigantic hacking knife? I also just read the 'Root canal' review (Excellent!) and am shocked that the author had not even done basic research about the location and backdrop to this book. Unforgivable.So many niggly criticisms that I can't really be bothered to write them all but this book is much too long and should have been brutally hacked to make it more pacey, with more tension. And more believable characters. Another deep fault - not having an interesting subplot. So all you have to engage you is the main plot. Kit and Laura (mostly Laura) - I find these London pseudo socialist types with their predictable views very cliched. I suspect Miss Kelley is one of them. How unoriginal.The fire. Not believable. (I'm a fire safety consultant so yah boo to you). Get a smoke detector! And that is exactly what the fire service would have said to you. Where is your smoke detector, stupid? Candles burning in hallways don't set the wallpaper alight. You would need an accelerant or some flimsy net curtains. Or a decent arsonist. And the arrogant way Kit and Laura left the burned out flat 'for the landlord' is just typical of the personality defects of these two main protagonists. I assure you, the landord in such a case would have had something to say to this reckless pair. Even if the landlord should have installed a smoke detector himself. Where is Environmental Health when you need them?IVF? Not properly narrated - as if author didn't know much about it.Court? Police? Lawyers? Rich people? All characterised with that slight anti-authority pseudo socialist bias. Not very well done, Missy.Last litte gripe ... no humour in it at all. No jolly little asides or in jokes between characters. This really makes it plod and is the main reason it fails. Because everyone makes jokes, particularly couples. siblings etc .. lack of humour makes the narrative seem false.Enough ranting. This one is going to the charity shop.Anyway - to a future reader - you can skim most of the dull stuff and fast forward to the last chapters.",2
5707,"I'm fairly certain that this product is being rated higher than it deserves from a lot of people who were sent it free for review. My experience with it so far is that it really doesn't give much of a close shave at all, in order to get close-ish you have to press it in against the skin which results in irritation as bad or worse than a normal rotary shaver and even then it's really not that close at all. The only case where i can imagine it giving a good shave is if someone has very thin patchy stubble.Don't listen to those saying it gives nearly as close a shave as a proper wet shave with a razor. Imagine you shaved 18-24 hours ago and have some stubble... that's what this thing feels like right after shaving with it.It's also no good with the combs to trim a beard, takes ages, gets clogged up and nowhere near as quick and efficient as things like a remington barba which is much cheaper.",2
5708,"I'm not that impressed with these, they do their job and protect the screen, and they're very easy to apply, but within days both of the screen protectors were cracked. This is clearly much cheaper than cracking the actual screen, however I find the plastic protectors last much longer and keep the phone looking nice.",2
5709,I'm really struggling with this.  I'm just over 40 chapters in and I just cannot garner any kind of empathy with the two main characters.  They both appear to be the kind of people you just want to shake by the shoulders.  I'm struggling to think of two more inward looking bores.Does it get any better?The only thing keeping me going is the thought I'll be satisfied if they meet a sticky end!,2
5710,"I'm returning mine as it arrived with a scratch on the paintwork which I just cannot look past when I've spent over £200 on the thing.Let's give a very brief review of the 20 mins I used it whilst setting up before I noticed the scratch. User interface is quicker than I expected from reviews I've seen. Touch screen is pretty smooth. I'm not sure if the accelerometer is a bit iffy, but you are supposed to be able to tilt the watch towards you for the screen to light up so you can see the time. This didn't work on every time I tried it.There are minimal instructions in the box. You get only how to swap the straps and an instruction to download the Fitbit app. It would be good if it explained that you then use the app to set up and learn how to use the watch.The only other thing I tried before I noticed the scratch was setting up the pay. PLEASE check your bank is supported before buying this watch if you care about using this application. It only currently supports two British banks, I've never heard of either. No Lloyds/TSB/NatWest/RBS/HSBC etc.It instantly pulled through a text message I got whilst setting it up. Easy to read and dismiss. Great. I do find it limiting though that you cannot reply on the watch so if you really want a smart watch, this wouldn't be the one for you. Also, the ability to accept incoming phone calls is only useful if you have a Bluetooth headset attached to your phone. Otherwise you then need to speak into the phone once you've accepted the call on your watch so you might as well just accept on the phone. Would be good if there was an option on the watch to put your phone on loud speaker so you can answer from the other side of the room and still chat.Biggest bummer is in the photos - when I was packing it up to return due to aforementioned scratch, I of course did a factory reset to wipe any of my data off it. It has crashed the watch. I can't get it off the screen in my attached photo at all. So please be weary if you have one of doing a factory reset unless absolutely required as I followed the instructions on the Fitbit website for how to do it and it didn't work.Unfortunately I didn't use it long enough to understand whether the fitness tracking etc is worth using.All in all, tempted to splash out on an Apple Watch instead. I didn't at first as I'm unsure I'll still to an iPhone when I next upgrade. But if it means staying with iPhone to ensure I get a fully functional smart watch I'm up for it. For £240 I paid, I'd say the Ionic if well over priced (purely because you can get the Apple Watch S1 for the same price that does a lot more).",2
5711,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get into this book at all.  I thought I was going to enjoy it, but instead I was irritated by it.  It was on the list of a reading group of which I am a memeber, so I started it with high hopes.  Having read the glowing reviews on the back of the book, I was sure I was going to enjoy it.  The story, if it can be called a story was a good idea,- the German occupation of Gurnsey during world war two and how the Literary And Potato Peel Pie society came about,- but I think it would have worked better as a ""Straight"" novel.  However, in letter form as it is, I began to be unsettled by the introduction of so many different characters one after the other, and the fact that Juliet Ashon intersperses her letters to the people of Guernsey with one liners to her editor and friends seems to spoil the flow somehow.  If anyone wants to read a book ""Thronging with lovable people,"" (as The Guardian puts it, on the back of Mary Ann Shaffer's book) then I strongly suggest that they read ""THE BIRDS, THE BEES AND OTHER SECRETS"" by FRANCES GARROOD.  This book made me want to laugh out loud and cry at the same time.",2
5712,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure why this has such good reviews. I'm about half-way through and frankly very bored. I agree with other readers who have said it is very slow. It feels as though this could have been made into a short story rather than a 400+ page book. I don't like any of the characters and I can't conceive of any plot twists that would make this interesting. I am looking for another book to read as I don't think I can persevere with this any longer.",2

5720,"I've had a number of electric toothbrushes over the years, and was expecting this to be excellent. However, I can safely say I've really disliked it. The mounted timer is probably highlight of the device, as it also gives you a useful clock months bathroom. That aside, I didn't find that the toothbrush cleaned my teeth all that well - no better really than with a normal toothbrush.The build quality is far from impressive and the stand the toothbrush sits on incredibly basic. There's a petruding charging platform that the toothbrush sits on, and it barely secures it in. Overall, the design is only just functional, it seems years behind some other big brands in terms of quality.Probably the most annoying thing about this toothbrush is the charging light. If you charge your toothbrush in your bedroom, there's a bright, pulsating blue light. It's bright enough to summon the bat from Gotham. You'll likely end up, like me, apologising to your other half or charging it in a different room (or just avoiding it altogether).I have since bought the top end Philips model and the difference is night and day.

I switched to an electric razor as the cost of multiple blade razor heads are too expensive for me and I was hoping this would be a long term solution. I now use sensitive skin products to treat the effects of this razor but I when used a wet razor I wouldn't have considered my skin to be sensitive.I cannot find a way of using this product to do a clean shave without irritating my skin:1. A dry or wet shave without foam cuts well but leaves me razor burn immediately. One with foam does not cut the hair.2. You must go over an area multiple times against the grain to get a clean shave, irritating the skin. I can do an area up to 4 times before the hair is finally caught by the shaver. Most of the time I will give up and use the secondary razor to cut the hairs and then return with the main.3. A light hand doesn't catch the hair properly as the middle of the main razor doesn't catch hairs. A heavy hand leaves razor burn.4. Even with a pre-wash, post cold water cooling and post shave lotion my skin is left irritated.On the plus side the razor holds charge for a good amount of time and doesn't lose power in the shave until it runs out of battery.I have no given up trying to get a decent clean shave from this product, a straight razor sounds like the best solution for me.",2

5728,"I've read and thoroughly enjoyed three of Erin Kelly's previous novels (in particular, The Poison Tree) - so I had high expectations for this novel; after all, you expect a writer to become more accomplished and for their plots to become tighter and character development better. Sadly, that's not the case with He Said/She Said - to the extent that I began to wonder if this was an earlier writing attempt by Kelly, now being passed off to a public who'll be willing to buy whatever she writes based on previous work. To be honest, I don't quite know where to start with why this novel fails so badly - be it the weak, unlikable characters; dull, overwrought plot; feeble attempts to build tension or the terrible continuity errors that are inexcusable from what's supposed to be an established writer who, presumably, has a decent enough editor.I won't repeat the plot itself - others have done that, although some of my review includes SPOILERS - so look away now if you don't want to know.In a nutshell, the whole novel (which jumps back and forth between 2000 and 2015) is based upon the fall-out from what Laura witnessed during an eclipse festival in 2000 - namely the rape of Beth, and Laura and her boyfriend Kit's subsequent involvement in the court case that followed. I did think, given the title, that this novel would be much more nuanced and interesting, following the different view points of Beth's alleged attacker (Jamie) and Beth herself. It's not. In truth, the novel should be called 'Travelling Around To Watch Eclipses and Avoid Beth'. Much is made, via the device of foreshadowing, of something 'big' that happens five years later in Zambia (by this time, for various reasons, Kit and Laura are afraid of Beth). They spend most of their time trying to live off the radar, least she find them. Although Kit's not that bothered, because he does stick to his eclipse-chasing timetable (known by Beth) but thinks growing a beard and wearing a baseball cap is probably enough to put her off the scent. Anyway, by the time we get to what 'happened' in Zambia, we find out it's nothing. There is no incident. Beth was simply there. Again, much is made of what's called 'the video' - something posted online that triggers Laura's panic attacks and anxiety. Must be pretty terrible/frightening, you'd reckon, eh? No, it's not. These little morsels - promises of better things to come from this lacklustre novel - never panned out into anything more than meh moments. The tension-building feels so desperate at times that, towards the end of the novel, Beth brings Laura some documents to read and gives her an hour - telling her she'll wait for her in the pub for that amount of time and no longer. Laura starts reading them at 7.31 and the chapter ends on the worst 'cliff-hanger/tension-builder' I think I've ever read in a novel: 'The clock jumps to 7.32'. Ohhh, I'm on the edge of my seat - you'd better speed-read then, hadn't you Laura.Then there's the pace of the novel - a lot of the time it felt like page-space was being filled. The writing didn't work to pull me along and, at times, I felt like screaming. I'm all for scene-building and description in novels, but only if it adds to the character-building, scene-building or overall atmosphere. However, when I'm 67% into a novel and it's lagging, yet I'm reading lines like, 'I stand up, feeling the camera strap cut into my neck and, draining the last of my Faroese beer, strike out after Richard for the ship', I'm yawning. I don't give a fig what Kit's camera strap is doing to his neck. Again, during this chapter, the reader's rewarded with yet another damp-squib anti-climax when we discover that the person showing round a photo of Kit, trying to track him down, isn't Beth but someone he knew years ago. By this point, I honestly didn't care about Kit (weak, dull, uninteresting) or Laura (smug, whiny, worthy). The characters were all really unlikable - down to Laura stating that they'd lied on their mortgage self-certification application. Okay, I know this was a 'thing' back in the day for some people - but it doesn't help to build empathy for characters - especially ones that are trying to hold themselves out as being morally unimpeachable.On top of all this, there were continuity errors that I found inexcusable in a novel by such an established author. If I'm spotting them, hasn't the author or her editor taken the time to bother having a good read through? For example, Beth comes to see Kit and Laura - the timeline header is 28 May 2000 and the chapter begins: 'It was a Friday evening....' The next chapter's timeline header is 30 May 2000 and that chapter begins: '.. I tiptoed up the stairs and tried to sneak past (Beth). It was a Saturday.' Well, surely, then, it should be the 29 May or a Sunday. And then, a little further on in the same chapter, Beth's described as having been there for 4 nights - which would make it 1 June and a Monday night. While I realise this might sound pedantic, it's shoddy - especially when dates are used as part of the chapter subheads. It's yet another thing that made this novel feel rushed out, and that the writer wasn't really giving loyal readers the quality they deserve. Another example is towards the end of the novel when Laura says she's approached by a dumpy little woman with dark grey hair. Two sentences on, the same woman's described as having white hair.As for the denouement of the novel - a lot of it was easy to guess ahead of time and it just wasn't particularly satisfying. It felt like a lot of set-up for not much in the end.Would this put me off reading another Erin Kelly book? Possibly. I won't be rushing out to buy her next novel quite as quickly as I have in the past. It's a pity because while some authors get better and better, others seem to become lazy or churn out mediocre books because they rely on an established readership buying them (Dean Koontz is one - brilliant at the start of his career but then swapped quality for quantity). It'll be a shame if Erin Kelly goes the same way because when she is on form, her novels can be brilliant.",2

However, for me something was missing in the book but cannot quite work out what. I also didn’t like how the storyline moves backwards and forwards in time. I understand that it has to be done in this book so that you can find out what has happened to the characters and to understand the storyline. However, personally I have struggled with books written like this for a long time so I put it down to my own preference.I also liked how the book is written in first person. I like books that are written like this as as it makes you think the character is talking to you in person.Even though this book wasn’t for me, it might be for you.

5740,"Instructions are HORRRIBLE. If ur a person who needs them then don't get this product. The protector it self didn't stick to good a lot of bubbles, managed to get them out but still frustrating. I've used different types of protectors and this was not worth it. Annoyed that I bought two of these for two phones. Same thing happened with both applications.",2
5741,Instructions are unclear and application of the protector is pretty difficult and if you make an error once with the application thw adhesion is completely lost. Not impressed.,2
5742,Instructions info printed so small on the pack its almost unreadable. Very fiddly to apply.,2
5743,Interesting in patches,2
5744,It advertises that it cuts a4. Yes but what it didn't say was tha it only does so on the short side.,2
5745,It broke in my bag with my keys on the first day of use,2
5746,"It can't charged fully, although I have kept charged over 16-20 hours. Can I know the reason for the situation？ The berry just keep 2mins although I have kept charged over 16-20 hours already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So how can I do? is it broken??????",2
5747,"It comes with 2 screen protectors, which is quite handy because the first one actually broken when i tried to detached the sticker from the tempered glass....",2
5748,It could work if only it could stuck to the window. the suction pads are really badly made and are totally inefficient to stick to the window.When it stuck then I think it will work to black out the light because the curtain itself appears to be good quality.I got it today and I'm not sure yet it I will keep it or send it back.,2
5749,It cuts a straight line well. But not at 90 degrees to the edge that has been lined up. Way too much wiggle room in the blade guide. This may or may not be a problem depending on the task at hand. But. For me it is not usable for the frequent cut I need to perform. But it will do for some other projects.,2
5750,"It did not deliver acceptable comfort as it was advertising,My review:[...]",2
5751,"It didn't work very well, the cutting disk is slightly off from the indication line meaning many of my cuts were off and it struggled with 300gsm card stock.",2
5752,"It didn’t protect my screen when I accidentally dropped my phone, in fact my screen cracked and I now have to shell out on a new screen. I won’t be buying another one of these when it’s fixed.",2
5753,"It does make difference after putting it on only if the suction pad doesn't fall off. But that seems to be the killing point for this product as without the strong reliable  suction pad, the light just shines in through whichever gap ls that don't close up properly. Sadly have to return it",2
5754,"It does not come with the standard European plug; I wanted the toothbrush to be compatible for usage in Germany and the plug isn't, it's slightly bigger than the standard German plug.",2
5755,"It does not cut that much, to have a full shave you have to pass a lot of times, with the final result that to have a full shave you are going to take 10-15 minutes. That is too much, no offense",2
5756,It does not fit the i-phone 6s screen there is a space of 3-4mm all around the face of the phone that is not covered so you really notice the screen is on the phone. Not ideal I will be looking for one that actually fits !!,2
5757,"It doesn't cut hair very well and the two-part plug doesn't fit (distance between the connecting parts is too small), despite being made in Germany which is also my country of residence. So, at the moment, can't recharge until I found a fitting adapter. Resorted back to my traditional shaver!",2
5758,It doesn't cut in line with the line marked on the tray.,2
5759,"it doesn't fit the iphone 6s, it's too small :-( just glad it wasn't expensive",2
5760,It doesn't really do its job! used it a couple of times..now is sitting in my cupboard,2
5761,"It doesn't stay in place, very frustrating",2
5762,It doesn't work as I expect. I spend 2x 3x times than with another old model.,2
5763,It got better towards end.  I usually enjoy this authors books but not this one.,2
5764,"It got two stars because when it's wedged in between the hinges of the window and finally stays up it does black out the room. However it took about a half hour of falling off and getting out of bed before i finally gave up and tried this. The suckers don't work, it's almost as if they're too small and can't hold the weight of the blind. Waste of money.",2
5765,It has made my life so easy. Perfect to make quick meals. Really happy.=================Update: All of a sudden something has gone wrong with it. All water evaporates out of it and it does not go from showing ON on LCD to its normal countdown operation. Water keeps on evaporating until pot becomes completely empty and then it displays error.Twice this has happened and when I got back to home I was shocked to see water all over my shelves. It also caused damage to my cooking books and manuals.,2
5766,"It is a good piece of hardware but the whole Amazon-centric environment is really annoying.Fire for kids is probably good for 2 years old, no more.The advertise 10000000 of free non-ads apps, but none of the most popular are there. I was hoping to click on Minecraft...I put one of my mp3 on the device, there is no way to share it with the child.Books downloaded to the device, no way.Ok, give the child an ""adult"" profile: they need an Amazon account!As soon as you put a foot off the Amazon path, it becomes an expensive brick.Stick to plain Android!",2
5767,"It is difficult to give a star rating that is fair and equitable.  The up side was that the system was easy to set up and it worked really well for over 3 months.  The down side is that it now takes out my internet every time I have it connected.  An internet searched revealed that other users were having problems if they had a BT Hub5 router with a TP-Link 1200, and that this was after it worked fine initially.  I also have an old AV200 Solwise system which has worked well for over 5 years.  I originally thought it must be this finally giving up the ghost.  However, after running a series of tests the Solwise works fine, but the TP-Link does not. I have ordered another Solwise system and will return the TP-Link.The TP-Link seems to work well with compatible routers - unfortunately it does not work well with the BT Hub5, I tried it with 3x BT Hub5 routers and same problem with all three.",2
5768,"It is impossible to get only one wipe from the package , this is what i hate about these wipes. But unfortunately only natural wipes i could find so far. So keeping ordering them regularly",2
5769,"It is not possible to recharge it as it is. The distance between the rechargers poles are to narrow to fit into the plug.If you are concerned and want to solve this issue, please send a  Universal Travel Plug to be used as ""middle station"" for the recharger to fit the wall plug.Thank you in advance.RegardsKlaus",2

5772,"It is rare for me not to finish a book so I did plough on with this one and in fairness it did get better in the second half.  However, I certainly did not enjoy it.  I didn't like the style of writing and I didn't like the subject matter.  Obviously others think differently but it was one of the few occasions when I didn't enjoy a book",2
5773,"It isn't oleophobic really, I can see too many smudges also remains some air at the bottom near the home button.",2
5774,It keeps falling down! Otherwise it blacks out very well!,2
5775,It kept falling off the window. I tried 5 times and now have given up on it!,2
5776,It looks like it might be a good product but I had to return it as there one only one in there and I ordered a two pack,2
5777,It may be someone's bestseller but doesn't rate in my list!,2
5778,It only shaved  reasonably clearly with three days grown beard.,2
5779,"It started so well: two distinct voices over two distinct time frames relentlessly leading to a singular pressure....  but then it all got unbelievable as previously nuanced characters became one dimensional in their wickedness, acting in bizarre ways for the purposes of a contrived conclusion. I'll keep an eye out for the author as she has writing skills, but ultimately a frustrating book.",2
5780,It takes about 5 minutes to trim a beard with this whereas any other shavers are a lot quicker. It works well without any of the attachments. It's not very powerful at all.,2

5782,"It was blunt after 50 cuts, 150gm glossy paper.The rubber safety bar just disintegrates. Overall a very poor product.If you only intend to use it once or twice a year then it's great value for money.Don't go near it if you intend to use it regularly.",2
5783,"It was too small for the screen so although it may have worked, the fact that it was asthmatically displeasing was enough for it to feel uncomfortable and look annoying enough for it not to be worth its possible effectiveness.",2
5784,"It worked for a month, then the battery died. I guess it was just mine with this issue, nevertheless I was a bit disappointed.Fortunately Amazon refunded me straight away.",2
5785,"It works with some dishes, but not with thick one, like curries for example. If there is not much liquid it burns at the bottom ant turns off. Unfortunately it is not a slow cooker too. Even on low setting it boils food immediately and than keeps the temperature which ruins most or slow cooked dishes. It is good yogurt maker, and this is what its used for at the moment. But it is a little expensive for yogurt maker.",2
5786,It's a functioning toothbrush but the charging times are ridiculous. It takes nearly 24 hours for a full charge then only lasts just over a week! I should have just stuck with my old toothbrush model.,2
5787,"It's a Goldilocks thing, when it's good it's good but... I often have to fiddle about to get the lid to seal so the thing pops up. I have to thicken up the stew liquid after cooking or it burns on the bottom. Not used as a slow cooker as it boils and seems too hot and can't see any benefit over using it as a pressure cooker.",2
5788,"It's a little difficult to review this since the problems I experienced might be particular to my house and the electrical circuits therein but I'll try.Initially I bought just one pair/set of these.  Put the base in situ, near the (main) router.  The satellite in the loft alongside the other router, which was going to be primarily responsible for WiFi.  Synced them up and that was that, it worked.  At least initially.I found that the units were becoming increasingly intermittent and performance would steadily degrade until rebooting one or both and normal service would ensue, for a time.Fast forward a few months and I wanted to secure a more reliable connection for the office PC; so the plan was to buy another module, plug it in the office and connect the PC via ethernet so as to bypass the flakey WiFi.  Turns out you can't buy extension modules any longer, only full kits!  Searched high and low on the internet and individual units are like hens teeth!  So I reluctantly bit the bullet and bought another kit.  Plugged the modules in and after some tinkering to get them all working together, it all started to fall to pieces!  WiFi went from a little annoying but generally serviceable to outright infuriating.  LAN speeds also degraded appreciably though the connection and ping was more stable compared to WiFi.To summarise, and bear in mind that I'm a 'techie' so went to great lengths to troubleshoot and analyse different scenarios;- Not (easily) expandable - can't get add-on modules so have to buy entire kits- WiFi performance leaves much to be desired- Adding units (adapters/extenders) to the network seems to adversely affect performance- Expensive when compared to the likes of Netgear Orbi which creates a powerful mesh WiFi network... that works very effectively in my experience thus far",2
5789,"It's a lovely, well designed bit of kit but it isn't that brilliant at actually giving a good, close shave.Anyone like myself who buys this after being used to shaving with a wet blade system such as Gillette, is going to be pretty disappointed with the results you get.",2
5790,"It's a shame its advertised with nfc card payments, but does not work in the UK!! Fitbit cannot give a date when it will work! Bit mis-advertised really.",2
5791,It's actually smaller than the phone it self. Needs resizing😟,2
5792,"It's great - for strimming the short hairs. It's just like a miniature double-edge clippers rather than a ""blade"".",2
5793,It's not bad but I dropped it once and it wasn't a rough fall and it chipped. It's easy to make scrathes on it aswell. Also has bubbles on the perimeter of the protector that will not budge.,2
5794,It's ok but too small,2
5795,It's ok. The battery keeps dying on me whether it's charging all night or not.,2
5796,It's okay - particularly if you're not in a rush and don't mind not a very close shave?!,2
5797,"It's okay. I have noticed that the power you get if not fully charged is significantly reduced. It does tell you that you shouldn't worry about keeping it on charge constantly because you can't over charge it, perhaps this is why.I couldn't figure out what to do with the blue tooth device, looked like a very complicated setup/learning curve for something that should be relatively simple and straightforward. Haven't been able to find their app that they say exists as an alternative to using the Bluetooth function. Essentially Bluetooth functions have been made redundant",2
5798,It's too thick for my liking. It protrudes from the phone.,2
5799,It’s ok but not that great only bought as a temporary fill in while I wait for my quality one to arrive but don’t expect this product to be much more than just about able to do the job,2
5800,"It’s ok but.......It’s a half decent a tablet at a reasonable price, I bought two for my kids. The kid safe stuff is fine and let’s you relax with internet security. Here’s the but. Kids aren’t allowed music. I have no idea why, and amazon won’t tell you. Amazon music unlimited won’t work even with a family subscription. Other apps I can permit my kids to use. But not music.  It’s not security as I have an echo in the same room and Amazon couldn’t give two hoots about what the kids access on that. I really wish I’d known this before purchase. I wouldn’t have bought them. I’m happy for my kids to listen to music but for some reason Amazon aren’t. If you want your kids to listen to music then please don’t buy. It’s a very bad product.",2
5801,Item is as described but one of them came already cracked. The other is currently in use and works a treat,2
5802,Item is huge!!! Now I understand it's used for multiple sized Windows and stuff but there is so much spare and also foldin leads to light seeping throughAlso more importantly the suction cups are too big for some windows and this means you'll have to come up with another way to keep the thing up.After that it does its job brilliantly,2
5803,Items missing from package..,2
5804,"Its good for travel, but the suckers have a tendancy to come off the window over night which means daylight can still get through and wake little ones up",2
5805,Its not design for kids under 3,2
5806,Its ok for thin hair. Struggles with my beard which is quite thick,2
5807,Its ok for thin hair. Struggles with my beard which is quite thick,2
5808,Its ok i suppose not the best one ive owned does the job just about,2
5809,Its really annoying the way it cuts the motor power if it thinks you are pressing too hard (which isn't hard at all).  It happens all the time as you move around your mouth.  You concentrate more on not getting the thing to cut the motor power rather than brushing your teeth.  So I dont like it and bought the Phillips Sonicare instead - far better on many levels and quicker and no annoying power cuts!,2
5810,its too tight  but okay,2
5811,Just as others have stated the quality of this product has vastly changed. Now they are no longer biodegradable the texture of the wipe is just like other much cheaper wipes. Won't be buying these again and so disappointed to have spent so much expecting the previous quality :-(,2
5812,Just could find any enthusiasm for this book even though a friend had raved about it.  Gave up after only a few chapters,2
5813,Just did not work for me at all ... bought Netgear powerline wifi instead which worked first time and in under 30 seconds!,2
5814,Just doesn't shave close enough. Missed hairs and constantly going over same patch. Disappointed.,2
5815,"Just finished this book and I'm still waiting for the twist. I love the idea of the book being based around the eclipses but that was the only thing I loved. I think in an effort not to give away the (frankly, predictable) twist, the story was lacking in detail and I found  it hard to remember what happened / been said  and what hadn't.Forgettable and not credible.",2
5816,Just not that great,2
5817,"Just paid £40 more for this as I bought it four days ago, price up and down like a yoyo!",2
5818,Just reordered 12 packs again and to my suprise found these slimline ones which effectively means you need way more each time. I feel cheated about this. AVOID this multipack.,2
5819,Keeps disconnecting from WiFi on its own,2
5820,Keeps falling off. Vaccume quality is poor.,2
5821,Keeps the light out really well that's if you can get them to stay on the window as it takes some doing but once up works good,2
5822,"Keeps your phone super cool in the summer. Very easy to install. Not very sturdy, I wouldn't trust your super expensive phone with this. After a few months use its fallen off a couple of times,once in my foot well while driving. Over time its become loose and ill fitting.",2
5823,Lasted 6 months and now has 2 large air bubbles along the edge and by the home button.Looking for a replacement already,2
5824,Lasted a month,2
5825,"Lasted about a week, got a replacement, broke again after a few months. Also the europlug adapter doesn't fit in any socket, I had to make a custom adapter to make it work.",2
5826,Lasts 5 months then stoped charging gd while it lasted,2
5827,"Like most people I was drawn in by the quirky title of this book.It's pretty slow to get going. The main character Juliet has the most perfect existence with money, success, intelligence, beauty and suitors lining up all over the place, sending her flowers galore and whisking her off to the Savoy every five minutes, which she seems rather ungratful for. The Islanders on the other hand are drawn as a backward bunch of witchy hillbillies.I agree the plot is completely implausible and the ending was simply daft.It has however, made me want to see the Channel Islands, not that the author ever did, for any significant length of time. Maybe she googled images of Guernsey. i might do that now actually.God bless.",2
5828,"Look really good on the phone, but the edge on mine has chipped already in 2 places from where it has presumably rubbed against coins/keys in my pocket. Now onto the 2nd screen and it has cracked within 2 days",2
5829,Looks good but wouldn’t synch with iPad or iPhone so returned. Now continuing to use my old Charge 2 instead.,2
5830,"Looks good from first impressions, but I seemed to have missed the fact you can't actually download videos/movies. I bought it for traveling so that's completely useless! I don't have prime, so the year free fire for kids is a bit pointless in this instance. Does it say this anywhere?",2
5831,"lost its charge quite early on in its life but shaved really well - now many years later, 1 hour charge will give me about a 1 minute shave, really worth £50? dont think so - disappointed",2
5832,Love the wipes but they don't come out of packet..... You pull one out and the next one does not follow meaning two hands are needed to route around and find the next one. Not practical with a wriggling baby. Have changed brands as a result which is a shame,2
5833,Loved poison tree but couldn’t really get in to this so didn’t finish,2
5834,"Lovely concept and much better than cotton wool and water BUT almost impossible to get just ONE wipe out...You end up pulling out a whole bunch which you then have to cram back into the packet and more often than not they dry out..Not easy to use one handed when changing a baby's nappy!I even bought a wet wipes dispenser to try solve the issue but once I pulled a clump out the next one ""disappeared"" in the packet so I had to open the dispenser box and start again...Very frustrating!",2
5835,Low cost light duty Trimmer which does not look suitable for sustained usage. It is best suited for domestic use and has the advantage of small bulk and weight for easy storage. Low cost so reasonable value for money.,2
5836,low quality,2
5837,made well but it appears to interfere with other signals,2
5838,Make horrible noise,2
5839,"Makes cooking a joy except when you spend 2 hours on a meal and it ends up both burned and raw due to a repeated inability to seal. Troubleshooting methods are useless, much like the instant pot when it isn't feeling like working. Don't bother.",2
5840,"Man, this book felt long.I'll start off by saying that I really really wanted to like this book. I did. The premise of a lie told during a rape trial intrigued me and usually I love a book that examines that nature of morality. But He Said/She Said just didn't work for me. Even now, I'm not entirely sure why this is. Laura and Kit were believable, three-dimensional characters, the storyline was solid, and the book was well-written. What's not to like?For me, it just dragged. Particularly the first half. I felt myself having to force myself to go back to He Said/She Said and found myself repeatedly checking how much longer I had until I had finished it. Now, this may not be entirely fair. As I've already said, there are some very strong elements that make up He Said/She Said and I can actually see it doing very well once it is released. I just think that for whatever reason, unfortunately, it didn't work for me.Two Stars **",2
5841,Maybe i am not used to electric shavers but i wanted to switch and had not a great experience. Misses hairs pretty easily. Specially on the neck.,2
5842,Maybe it was my expectations after many years wet shaving but this Braun just doesn't leave me feeling clean shaved. will give it another go but not convinced,2

5847,Might as well use a blunt knife. Didn't do any good & wasn't worth the money.,2
5848,Misses almost as much as it cuts.Prolonged use trying to get a decent shave tends to cause as much heat as smooth cut. Ye canny beat an old wet shave for a decent job.,2
5849,"Mmmm.Well this was a slow starter and as the story progressed, even though I wanted to know what had happened and where it would all lead, I found myself less and less bothered about what happened to any of the characters. They are all unlikable (either because they are dull, moronic or appear to be nuts but not in an interesting way) and when the truth is finally revealed it is so far fetched and implausible all I could think was 'Why would anyone do that it makes absolutely no sense?'When I finished the book I uttered a mixture of sigh and growl at, my perceived, silliness of this book. That said, I would still read other books by this author because although I was getting annoyed with the story I made it through to the end.",2
5850,"Must admit I was surprised at the high rating for this book and agree with most of the comments for anything 3 or less.The only aspect I agree with in terms of being a page turner, is being compelled to speed read and skip through!. Dull, melodramatic and disproportionate  in terms of build up and impact throughout.",2
5851,"My baby is 8 months old and have been using these wipes since she was a newborn. I loved the brand so much that I stuck to them until now.However my last order was a big disappointment. First I noticed the box was a lot smaller which had me questioning a lot of things. Upon opening the box, I noticed the packaging had changed and the number of wipes had reduced from 72 to 60 wipes per pack. Secondly, the wipes were hard to get from the pack. You intend to pull out one but 2/4 comes out and end up going through 1 pack in under a week. Plus they are a lot thinner too. It’s super annoying. And the price changed too from £24 to £25, which I don’t understand since the quality/quantity of the wipes has gone down. I think it’s time to find another brand.",2
5852,My god. I give it 2 stars only cause I manage to hold it up by my netted curtain wire. Just would not stick. I thought with the new improved 2014 one it would be better and was really looking forward to getting it up. But I'm sorry to say what rubbish. Why's it so hard to get this right. It's not even about the heaviness just the suction cups are absolute rubbish.,2
5853,My screen protector cracked within days of having it and I haven't even dropped it,2
5854,"My son got this for Christmas and I have waited a couple of months to post my review.The daily goals / limits are a great idea and it is nice to be able to say that the Fire tablet knew that his time was up for today rather than have me take it from him! The performance of the tablet is good too and I like the protective covering.However, the main reason for two stars is that the tablet came with a trial subscription of 'Fire Unlimited for Kids'. This, however, is completely misleading. In the advertising for this product Amazon claim that it ""brings together all the types of content that kids aged 3-12 want, with thousands of books, movies, TV shows, educational apps and games."" However, there are no movies or t.v. shows available for Amazon.co.uk customers.When I queried this to Amazon I was brushed off with - ""Yes you are correct, we have passed on your comments to our team"" ... and that was it.As a long time Amazon customer I have never felt as let down about purchasing items from the company-  if they are misleading in their advertising for their own products how can we trust them to be honest brokers for items they have not manufactured (the majority of their listings).I have honestly not purchased anything from Amazon since this - but at least my wife is happy that I have not purchased the latest deal of the day!",2

5858,"Needed to get one of these to get rid of the temporary solution to a dead spot problem. The walls of the flat are solid blocks, so running a Ethernet lead through the wall or using wifi was a no go. I had been using a Ethernet lead going through the hallway and then connecting to a AC router in my bedroom, which worked but was quite unsightly.I had my eye of this for a while because of the external antenna and beam forming technology. On first appearance they are quite big, but it's not inconvenient. To setup, you plug in one and then hook them up to Ethernet and press the pair button and you're done. Very easy and no problems there.Performance wise might be something I need to update over time, but from my initial tests I was getting 145 Mbps down and 11 Mbps up. Over my previous Ethernet solution, I was getting 182 down and 11 up, so initially the results were disappointing. I was expecting a drop however. It always depends on different factors so everyone's performance will be different. Wifi performace was expected, about 120 down and 11 up. You can use the software to track the speed of the connection and I was getting about 450 Mbps, but you will never be able to get the 1200 Mbps, as that is only theoretical and bit cheeky of Tp Link to say so.UPDATE 10/12/2016I sent the powerline back a few days ago. Everything above was true until the next day. As far as I was aware, our internet was fine, but it kept dropping out. After that, it was only getting 100-110 mbps which I feel is too much of a drop considering the distance it had to travel (~15m). It would take ages to load a webpage and then suddenly come through, but once it had loaded a webpage, you could open a new one and it would work straight away. Leave it 5 mins and it does it again. Odd, but what I have seen before with other powerlines. I don't think the tech is quite there yet with these.",2
5859,Needs restarting every few days,2
5860,"Needs work. If you live in the uk the wallet app is useless (at the moment anyway) and the app store is minimal. As a smart watch there are better choices, as a fitness tracker/hybrid I hope it will improve. Big bonus for me is that it's waterproof and has a swim tracker, the exercise workouts feature is quite good but there could be more workouts included imo. I have yet to use the GPS feature. I have had a lot of syncing issues although these seem to have now resolved and Fitbit have been releasing patches and bug fixes which I think have addressed the problems....",2
5861,"Nice well built machine but cannot escape the fact it is nowhere near as good as a wet shave.  You have to really work at getting anywhere near a half-decent shave.  It is fine for a ""refresh"" but no good for a proper shave.  I was swayed by the reviews here but I can see no real improvement on electric razors I tried years ago.  I am going back to wet shaving.",2
5862,"Nice, powerful toothbrush. My last one, the Oral-B Triumph 4000 (with smart meter) finally kicked the bucket after a battery change and several years down the line.This one seems to tick all the same boxes.  A bossy smart meter that likes to patronise you into cleaning well by ""rewarding you"" with smiles and stars, several different brush heads for different functions. It also comes with a leaflet to extend your product warranty to three years, which is useful.The only down side I see from this model is the over bright LED lights that constantly flash as it is charging, which is rather annoying if you have to charge it anywhere other than a room you can completely shut off from where you might see the flashing. Charging this handle overnight in the lounge, it lit the entire room up like a christmas tree. I have now had to put a square of electrical tape over these flashing lights to dull it!As long as the battery survives a few years, I'll be happy.EDIT - I'm having to drop this a star from my original review, as it takes an utter age to fully charge from scratch (27 hours) and it goes down disappointingly fast. I do not have a power socket in my bathroom to be able to leave it plugged in at all times, so am forced to tolerate the intense blue flashing lights in another room... I am not happy about this.SECOND EDIT Jan 2016 - Another dropped star, as after only seven months of use and after a full charge (over 24 hours), the battery completely died on me after only 1 minute 22 seconds of use.Third Edit: The lifespan of these seems to be approx seven months. Either the battery will die on you, or the pressure sensor fails and thinks it's got too much pressure even if it's not touching anything. I'm not expecting this to last at all. My replacement this time (third one so far) takes as long (if not longer) to charge as the first model.  I'm very disappointed.Oral B toothbrushes were very good in the past, but this thing is just a money-making joke.",2
5863,no didnt work for me.,2
5864,No goods batteries.just 2 days work and 2 days charging....,2
5865,No mention anywhere that it doesn't come with a U.K. Plug!! Useless after the battery runs out unless I buy an adapter!!!,2
5866,No problem fitting. No bubbles BUT it's doesn't cover edge to edge of the iphone6s. There's about 5mm of unprotected screen round the phones front screen. The screen is curved but I would though this would be designed for it,2
5867,No way near as good a shave as you get using a Philips razor,2
5868,"No where near covers the screen, either sent the wrong type or this protector is just not compatible with I phone 6s",2
5869,"Normal annoying tics - in this case ""her"" (forgotten name already .... Laura???) white blonde hair. His nerdy weediness. Sub-characters with unnecessary endless detail - Max and his addictions. Ling who has no character at all. Unlikely Beth. The more I think about it, the sillier and more pointless it was actually. Yet another of those books where YEARS and the whole narrative hinge on moments of (unconvincing) misunderstanding",2
5870,"Not 100% impressed as the suction cups didn't work properly from day one, pretty disappointed.",2
5871,Not a bad shaver but it is rubbish at edging especially if your beard is slightly longer!,2
5872,not a book I would read.,2
5873,Not a close shaver.,2
5874,"Not a fine trimmer, and immediately looses cutting power as battery level decreases, reducing the shave quality",2
5875,Not a good book,2
5876,Not a patch on a wet shave.,2
5877,Not as good as a phillips,2
5878,Not as good as expected,2
5879,Not as good as I expected,2
5880,Not as good as I thought it was going to be to be honestI won’t be recommending it to any of my friends or family !!!,2
5881,Not as good as I thought it was going to be to be honestI won’t be recommending it to any of my friends or family !!!,2
5882,Not As good as my old 1 to me does not feel heavy enough blades don't feel like they are cutting as much as pulling might just scrap it,2
5883,Not as good has hoped have order a different shaver as this does not get the shave done in one stroke.,2
5884,Not as large as expected and some small gaps. Ok for possibly a very small bedroom for a tempory measure only.,2
5885,Not as moist as expected,2
5886,"Not at all my cup of tea the story just did not make a lot of sense, so perhaps it is me but I do not think I would bother with this author again,",2
5887,Not bad for the money but would only wear them casual but can't complain for less than a fiver,2
5888,not bio degradable,2
5889,Not biodegradable. Also contains traces of Benzalkonium Chloride.,2
5890,"NOT CHARGING SO GOOD, TAKES ALONG TIME.",2
5891,Not close shave,2
5892,Not compatible with all phones.. I've a one plus 3t.,2
5893,Not convinced they are real waterwipes. The wipes themselves are a lot smaller than the packets I have bought preivoously from Boots/ASDA etc and the packaging is different. They don’t feel like they have the same texture either. I am stopping my subscription!!,2
5894,Not convinced this product is genuine. Came in a plain brown box. Very disappointed.,2
5895,not easy to uuse,2
5896,Not even close to a razor...,2
5897,Not exactly what I expected from having other screen protectors in the past on previous phones. This one literally just covered the screen has no hole for the front camera and the speaker hole could be a little longer as it just about fits! Goes on the screen easily but I’ll be defo replacing this as there is a 2/3 mm gap round the edge that isn’t protected and will defo get scratched. I would say if you have an iPhone 7 it’s too small,2
5898,Not feel comfortable when using it,2
5899,"Not for me.  I really struggled through it, no thrills!  I gave 2 stars as the ending only slightly made up for the rest of it.",2
5900,Not for my typ of window,2
5901,"NOT GOOD - when folded up with Velcro light escapes through which kind of defeats the point of having it!!!  We have tried ironing it and now have taped it to our window - not happy, wish we could send it back!  Not a black out but does reduce the light level so if that's all you need then buy it but if like us you thought this would kill ALL light it does not!!",2
5902,Not good but not bad as some shavers. Best shave is still razor but as a shaver this is okay. Never as close as a razor but okay for lazy people like me who simply want a quick shave. Its good for cheeks but rubbish on your neck! Takes 20 minutes for neck and still rough!So overall I say rubbish for neck but okay for cheeks and tosh.Worth £10 at most!,2
5903,"not good for my hair and skin type, I come out in  a huge rash, it tuggs  alot :-(",2
5904,Not good to make rice. Only used 3 times and I had enough.,2
5905,"Not great at all, really quite disappointing",2
5906,not great falls off a lot,2
5907,"Not great, started to lift off screen almost immediately even though thoroughly prepped.",2
5908,"Not great. It shaves, just not very well. I've now used every type of shaver known to man and wouldn't recommend any of them. So I'm just going to stop wasting my money and grow a beard.",2
5909,"Not great.First device was dead on arrival and Amazon.Second one took several failed attempts to initialize despite being connected by bluetooth to a phone under 50 mm (2 inches) away and being connected to a 154 mbps wifi router with 200 Mbps fibre broadband 4 feet (1.2 m) away. So, the packaging said allow an hour to initialize but it ended up taking over 20 elapsed hours with me being involved in restarts etc for at least 8 of those hours.In the 3 weeks since then I've had one forced software upgrade and then what seem to be a second one but to the same version.  Each time most of my personal settings on the phone were lost or overwritten .  Each time I've had set them again using the Fitbit app.  Another 30 minutes I'm not getting back.My measured heart rate, sleep duration and sleep patterns are significantly different when measured by my old Fitbit pulse compared with measured by my new Fitbit Ionic.  I;'ve confirmed this twice by wearing them on opposite wrists for the last two weekends.  Don't know if one is 15% out or if they're both around 7.5% out in opposing directions.GPS accuracy is .poor  It can show me running on one side of the Thames and walking on water to the other side then back while the whole time I was running on the other side.  Has shown me running a street over from my actual route. I've run the same 4 mile route circuit 6 times  wearing this in 36 minutes give or take 30 s.  My average pace for this is recorded as anything from a flattering 7.8 minutes a mile to 12 minutes a mile (reason it recorded different distances each time for exactly the same circuit)",2
5910,Not happy overall. Doesn't fit the iPhone 6 screen properly. Fine,2
5911,Not happy with how small the screen protector is meaning it only covers the screen and doesn't go right to the edge. This means that the screen protector is very visble.,2
5912,Not impressed  little  extras don't  make my teeth any better than cheaper electric toothbrush s feel cheated,2
5913,"Not impressed with shaver,took ages to have shave.Overpriced",2
5914,Not impressed. I saw such glowing reviews so I thought I was getting something better than what I've used to (philips rotary shavers). But it leaves my face stubbly and my neck red. And it's extremely noisy. The charge /clean station is a good idea (but also noisy). Overrated in my view.,2
5915,Not keen on this book. Finished it but flicked through a lot of pages to get to the end,2
5916,"Not much change in the system apart from the screen. He wallet is not stable and not sure how you track the GPS, MAPS, and all the other features you would expect from £300",2
5917,Not only stung by a random price hike but the package was a little smushed. Product still fine but beware of making repeat purchases with price,2
5918,Not overly impressed with this as it doesn't stick to the window well at all. The suction cups keep getting unstuck and it falls down.,2
5919,"Not overly pleased, starting lifting after a week and is now chipping on the corners. Wouldn't but again",2
5920,Not quite what I needed,2
5921,"Not really happy with this at all. It’s black out, when it stays up! The stick on cups fall down all the time and let the light in our son’s room, really frustrating.",2
5922,Not really impressed,2
5923,"Not really into this product. I have tried so many shavers over the years and reverted back to the foil old school variety. This one is OK if you just have stubble, anything longer and be prepared for the tweazer effect!!",2
5924,"Not really it was built up so much buy advertising campaign ,that it was only as good as the 7 series for the cut, Bryan",2
5925,"Not so good. The cutting head is small so it takes a long time to shave all areas. The foils either side of the cutter don't collect all the hairs, often leaving a few single ones on the cheek which are visible and almost impossible to actually cut. The worst point is the fact that, because of the foils each side of the cutter it is impossible to get a clean line under the sideburns or around a moustache or half beard. I realise that on the more expensive version (£80) one of the foils retracts so that the cutter can go next to the hair line, but not on this model. I have not tried the £80 model so cannot say if it works well or not. The model of this review can only do about 5-6 shaves, in part because it takes longer than other razors because the cutter is small.The best point about this product is that its very gentle on the skin but if it does not cut well that is less important.I don't recommend it. If you do want to buy this model, better to trade up to the more costly model  but that has the same size cutter, or look elsewhere.",2
5926,"Not sure about this; applied mine according to instructions, but have an unsightly air bubble to bottom right that can't get rid off. Wandering whether I should leave and apply second one later or try replacing now...",2
5927,Not sure if I'm being stupid but this doesn't cover the whole front face of the phone. Several mms between edge of phone and screen protector although does cover the whole screen. I'm not convinced and was expecting it to cover the entire front of the phone,2
5928,"Not that great, especially for sensitive skin",2
5929,"Not that great, especially for sensitive skin",2
5930,"Not the best shaver, very disappointed. Works good on some areas like above and below the lip (except under the nose where it doesn't reach all the hair) but the for the rest of the face like cheeks and neck it's pretty useless. I have to use my razor to finish off which defeats the reason why I brought an electric shaver. In my opinion £45 is over priced even at a discount, I'm sure there are better electronic shavers available so next time I would do some research and spend a bit more money on a decent electronic shaver.",2
5931,Not the best trimmer,2
5932,"Not too bad nice fit but not as tough as I had hoped for , perhaps I should have bought a slightly better version",2
5933,"Not twisty, thrilling or gripping but slow, tedious, repetitive, rather boring and not particularly well written. So much hype for a rather ordinary novel which plods along a familiar trail of who did what. OK, there's a lot about eclipses - the author needs something to keep you reading but I gave up half way through. Literature Lite.",2
5934,Not up to the old shaver from braun,2
5935,"not very good ,don't waste your money",2
5936,Not very good at cleaning. Expensive considering just water and cloth. Just use homemade ones!,2
5937,Not very good device as it keeps freezing when child is playing game. I would not recommend this product.,2
5938,"Not very good for my skin left cuts allover my neck, not worth it if you have sensitive skin.",2
5939,"Not very good product,",2
5940,not very good. unable to cut my facilely hair evenly if at all!,2
5941,"Not very impressed, maybe I'll grow to like it in time.",2
5942,Not what I had expected!  Too flimsy and doesn't make either a clean cut or a complete cut. Bought to replace an old metal framed cutter that someone had used to cut mounting board and probably just needed sharpening but I thought it might be cheaper and more reliable to replace it. I was wrong!,2
5943,"Not what I was hoping for. Useless as a trimmer and just about OK as a shaver. Doesn't give a close shave but it gets the job done. Not sure about the durability,  it appears quite flimsy and replacement blades are very expensive. I'm afraid it'll end up in a draw.",2
5944,"Not worthy of the 5 star rating, slow story and full of errors. Took me an age to finish as just not that gripping, don't waste your time.",2
5945,"nothing but issues. first the plastic blade broke, today it fell on the floor from around 3 feet high and everything broke.It is useless and flimsy for this price (£29.99 on ebay when i got it)it did give a really close trim that surprised me and ive only had a clean shave once in the last 2 months for a wedding otherwise im always using this. its a shame.",2

5947,Nothing especial as for me . I have my presure cooker from groupon ( £20) the same job.,2
5948,"Nothing wrong with the product, but the way mini vents are shaped this item doesn't work as the weight pulls the phone down.Am sure would be fine for different shaped vents.",2
5949,Nowhere near as close a shave as I thought it would be. As for being a wet shaver !! It's a joke,2
5950,Nowhere near as good as ratings suggest. Has a hard time coping with my beard.,2
5951,Of all the shavers I have purchased this one is poor by comparison.You need a clean shaven face for this product.Any few days of growth and it totally fails.,2
5952,"Oh dear, I did not have a happy time with TP-Link.  Used with TP-LINK TL-PA8030P KIT AV1200 3-Port adapters I had chronic issues with Apple Airplay devices that were ethernet connected to the 8030P's.  Internet wifi was generally fine, however.  We have 2 x iPads and 2 x iPhones in the house (on IOS 8+ at the time) and the Bang & Olufsen A8 and the Apple TV were often not visible over Apple Airplay.  One device would show on one iPad, and the other would show on the other iPad.  And then both would disappear.  Restarting the WPA4220 would get things back to normal again... for a few hours.... and then they would start intermittently disappearing again.  My wife threatened divorce.  I had a couple of interactions with TP-Link support who were very helpful and gave a bunch of suggestions but nothing worked... firmware, config changes etc all in vain.  I switched to Devolo and the signals have been rock steady for 3 weeks now, saving my marriage.  So this 4220 and the 8030s will be going on ebay to try to recover some of my £120 outlay.",2
5953,Ok but not really my cup of tea,2
5954,ok but not that great falls off the window now replaced with proper blinds,2
5955,Ok however after a few weeks scratches do start appearing on the protector and mine has now cracked not that good.,2
5956,Ok i will start off with saying we got this as we needed to upgrade our Sonicare. As it was the latest model we both agreed it looked perfect.Now the brushing was good and left my teeth feeling clean. But my husband said it made his gumline sore. And what is with the gimmicks. Awful. The bluetooth never worked no matter how much i tried to understand it. Sorry Braun but you failed this family this time.,2
5957,"ok so the screen covers that arrived were supposed to be for an iPhone 6, unfortunately one was and one was for an iPhone 5!! Hw this can be mixed up in the same package I don't know. Didn't bother contacting the seller as the other one came in useful on my daughters iPhone. Anyway as for the quality of the screen cover its shocking because after putting it on the phone I put the phone with the hardened toughened screen protector which is hardened to 9H and can take the force of a drill in my pocket with my keys, which are obviously less powerful and not as sharp as a rotating drill, to only find that my keys managed to chip a chunk out of the screen protector!! I wouldn't mind but I wasn't doing anything out of the norm and I do not have a manual job!This product only gets two stars because it came on time and actually fits perfectly the phone, but as for quality...a lot to be desired!!",2
5958,"Ok so there only a few quid and great whilst they last but mark my words after a month or 2 THEY WILL CRACK AND CHIP . However like I say good whilst they last and not overly expensive , but expect to keep replacing them ( used a family phones not just mine and all same results )",2
5959,"Ok toothbrush...does the job.Battery life is terrible, recharge takes a long time, timer is just a gimmick",2
5960,"Ok, but not as good as my old braun.",3
5961,"Ok, but not very easy to align on screen and doesn’t fit my iPhone 6s screen well because of the curve around the edge, leaves a gap around the outside as if it’s not big enough so looks a bit naff.",2
5962,"OK, so i am one of those shavers who has pretty much always wet shaved with a Gillette razor - i have had no real complaints over the last 20 years but thought I would use some technology in my mornings and perhaps save time. Upon opening the product is impressive, nice to hold etc, shame there is no dock for charging.However, when it came to shaving i was thoroughly disappointed. Not close at all, missed loads despite going over and over and over the same spot - i even had another go after showering to get the bits i could feel were nowhere near close enough. So for me, this is clearly a waste of time and back to the wet shave for me.",2
5963,okay expected a more gripping story,3
5964,"Okay, so I really really wanted to try these as they seem quite „posh” especially looking at the price of them. First of all be prepared to carry an extra pound in your bag!!! These are literally soaked in the water and fruit solution. I found them flimsy to get out of the packaging, and shaking off to unfold results in spraying water everywhere. These wipes are weird for me, it takes quite a few of them to wipe a dirty bum as they just don’t catch anything. Hard work!! Plus, they don’t remove my mascara, which all other wipes do :) We will stick to Huggies Pure, they are also 99% water, still wet but a lot lighter. And wipe bums and mascaras like a pro!Note* I have received a promotional 4pack of these wipes and after testing this is my honest opinion. Thank you.",2
5965,One of the pair keeps dropping the speed and requires restart.,2
5966,One of the screen protectors (comes with 2) it's shattered .,2
5967,"One of the screen protectors arrived broken, which you could blame on the packaging but I do expect something that claims to be able to handle a hammering to survive transit.The screen protector that arrived intact was very difficult to install; the installation stickers that came with it weren't sticky enough and didn't stick to the side of the phone, so I just had to be careful and do it manually. The protector itself feels matte, you can tell that there's a protector over your screen from the texture unlike other protectors where the glass simply feels like the phone screen.There's the usual ~4mm gap on all sides of the protector but I guess this is a limitation of the curved screen rather than the screen protector itself.It's as responsive as the screen and other protectors I've owned so no trouble there. No problem with 3D Touch.I'm already buying replacements, since I don't expect this one to be very reliable.",2
5968,One of the screens was broken - please advise what I should do ?,2
5969,One of the screens were ok and the other has a minor crack on it already. Was ok at first but then my phone dropped and the screen protector was basically useless.,2
5970,One of them was cracked so only got one,2
5971,One or more of the packets are leaking as box came wet inside. Only time will tell how many of the wipes in the packs will go dry and wasted by the time we use all 12 packs...,2
5972,"One smashed as soon as I went to put it on the phone, they didn't fit the whole screen and it was meant for my phone!",2
5973,One was broken but one wasn't and went on fine,2
5974,One word. Boring. I am skim reading and skipping pages simply because I want to find out what happens. But so far so dull. Hoping for a shocking twist as the reviews have said but not sure the mundane of all these chapters will be worth the reveal.,2
5975,"One worked ok, the second just shattered as I took it out of the packet. Perhaps thats why they give you two!",2
5976,"Only 2 stars due to it being rather incomplete product, if you use it for fitness tracking it's fine, but if you want to use it as watch and tracking is just ad-on I would recommend you to wait:-I haven't found any new apps other than pre-installed or clear place where to look for them if there are any-Fitbit pay has only available 10 banks you can add card details from, NO UK banks yet, with long wait till we see more added-didn't manage to change order of apps on it as I use only 2 at the moment and need to swipe to get to them-can't freely manage what info is displayed on clock face or how its displayed like american order for dateI'm not using for other sports other than swimming, It is accurate as you set pool length right, BUT turning on tracking for swim will STOP monitoring of your heart rate so for now if I want heart rate monitoring I'm leaving it to auto recognition when it connects to phone afterwards",2
5977,Only got halfway through. Was recommended from our book club but I kept falling asleep trying to read it. I was expecting a single white female type story but it never got going. The lead female got on my nerves a bit as well.,2
5978,"Only has the pandora app for USA, otherwise transfer your music manually.No major UK banks supported so lack of NFC paymentIf these flaws were better advertised I would have avoided purchasing.",2
5979,Only one had a sticky back on it.,2
5980,"Opened the box come time to brush the teeth in evening. Loads of useless cheap plastic-y crap surrounding an expensive toothbrush. Comes with a confusing selection of 5 different toothbrush heads. Why? Does not come with charge, and only two pin adapter on charger so I can not actually brush my teeth. I have just purchased an adapter to plug in to wall separately, that will be here in a few days. What a faff just to get started.Toothbrushes aren't complicated, yet they have managed to make it so.",2
5981,Ordered a box of 12 wipes and only received a box of 11. They are heavy so not going to go through the returns process but wanted to report the issue.,2
5982,Over rated,2
5983,overpriced ..in boots it is offered for 36 poundscardboard background which is not legibleOne buys a UK product expecting a UK 3 PIN this comes with a European 2 Pin adding extra cost and inconvenience to look for a 7 pound converter,2
5984,"Pack of two. One was fine, the other was defective and a waste of money.",2
5985,Packed in after 13 months of light use.,2
5986,Parts of the this screen protector chilled just from hitting books and other items in my bag. The protector also started peeling off around the edges after a few weeks.,2
5987,"Please don't look at the RRP price of this brush , it is very misleading !!I think this Electric brush should not cost more than £50. Battery charging takes ages and  only last for 3-4 brush times of 2-3 minutes each. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it brushes well but other than that it is not premium brush. The travel case provided with it is made with very cheap plastic. It doesn't completely close either.Wireless timer is nice but I find it doesn't sync properly with the app. It could be the issue with the oral-b app or possibly the wireless timer.",2
5988,Pleased at first but stopped working by Octoder,2
5989,Plus points - cordless and waterproof.  Good battery life between charges.Minus points - nowhere near as close a shave as my 15 year old Braun foil shaver and much slower to use.  Look elsewhere for a close shave!,2
5990,Poor product for the price as foils don't last long purchase a Phillips travel shaver you won't be disappointed,2
5991,Poor to be honest.You have to press very hard sometimes for it to actually trim. Sometimes it can be painful as it starts pulling hairs out!,2
5992,Poorly made. Returned,2
5993,"Poorly written,poorly drawn characters,only read because of my book club. Not very convincing.i would not recommend anyone to waste their time on it.",2
5994,Pretty crappy really. No better than the 10 year old one I've got - in fact that seems to have more torque than this thing. Binned the stupid bluetooth screen trying to tell me how to brush my teeth. Frankly I'm using the enclosed brushes with my old oralb and this one has been consigned to the bin.,2
5995,"Pretty disappointed in this to be honest; I can't pivot it to face me and so it awkwardly faces more towards the window, making it difficult to follow my satnav... I'm not a fan.",2
5996,"Pretty disappointing! I have been looking for a decent electric razor for a while after getting fed up with the cost of disposables. I read numerous web articles about how good this razor was, how effective it cut and how it gave smooth shave.  I don't grow the thickest of beards so expected this to handle my facial hair without a problem.  It clears the hair on my face quite well, though leaves a lot of stray hairs you have to keep going over.The problem is on my neck.  The shave is so patchy it's embarrassing.  The razor struggles if it's 1 day or 4 days there are patches of hair that no matter how many times you go over it will not clear.  Having spent over £150 on a razor I am disappointed.  I have to use some gel and a cheap £2 disposable to finish the shave.For the price would not recommend.",2
5997,Pretty good for black out purposes but suction cups not very effective.,2
5998,"Pretty nasty. Although very easy to fit and has no bubbles in main screen area, it doesn't adhere properly at the edges as other people have said so the outline all around the protector is very prominent and obvious. Also I understand that it can't go right to the edge of the screen because of the curved design of the phone, but the protector is so thick that dust quickly gathers around the edges and in the earpiece/front camera cutout, making it even more obvious and ruining the sleek look of the phone. Basically, whilst I'm sure it's great for preventing scratches, it's ugly as sin.",2
5999,Previous shaver Braun Series 3 4776  was superior.Gave a quicker and closer shave.O that it could be revived,2
6000,Previously ordered two sets of these for my family with no problems and thought this to be a brilliant product. However the third set I just ordered had chips/marks in around the edge so couldn't be used.,2
6001,Product is fine but the box was damaged and we are short by a whole packet.,2
6002,Product okay but the charger is a US one,2
6003,product returned due to failing battery,2
6004,"Pros:Easy setup* Durable case* Good two-year no-questions warranty (haven't tested this, yet, though).* Responsive (good CPU)Cons:* No YouTube App, not even the one for kids.  That's about 50% of the use of a tablet.* Sound cuts out while using apps, and can be hard to get back. Seems to be a software issue as the solution is usually found digging around in one of the adult support accounts.  Then cuts out a few days later.* No 5GHz WiFi, support for which has existed for years.Update: The sound problem is getting worse.  Tablet almost unusable.",2
6005,Protectors came quickly however when I put one on there is a manufacturing defect in the glass which has made it have a bubble. The screen was prepared properly before putting on.,2
6006,"Purchased for my new iPhone 6s but this screen protector doesn't cover the screen of the phone at all, it only sits in the middle of the handset. How can this protect the screen. I have to return the item without using it.",2
6007,"Purchased this for my elderly Dad in later January this year. 2 months on & it doesn't work. Overheats. Impossible to find out through Amazon website how to return it for repair,replacement or refund as none of those options are offered through the account 'orders' section? If anyone at Amazon reads this can they please get in touch as this is very frustrating?",2
6008,"Quality of the courtain is good, but  the plusg dont stay in the glass the material is very cheap",2
6009,"Quality shaver, worked really well straight off, almost as close as a wet shave. After a month of use..not so good, lost it's edge and a shave that took 10 minutes now takes 30 plus. I read reviews that the foil lasts 18 months, that's simply not true or even close.",2
6010,Quite expensive for what it is. Does not hold the phone securely have to keep pushing it back on.,2
6011,"Quite flimsy, doesn't feel very good quality - using is a bit difficult too - the blade also doesn't seem to be very sharp",2
6012,Quite small,2
6013,Rather small but ok for theMoney. Wouldn't pay full price,2
6014,"Read all reports before you buy this product. A number of people (me included) have had problems with the battery not holding a charge.All was well for about 6/7 weeks using it 2 times a day. Then the battery decided it was going to give in!I was extremely satisfied whilst it was working, but unfortunately, I do not have the confidence to give a recommendation.",2
6015,"Read this having seen the great views. Really poor writing. Characters unbelievable couldn't relate to them, writer failed to create any depth to the characters. I just didn't  care what happened to them. Why couldn't they just go to Leicester uni, how did they afford to live in their London flat? Glass and fire idea ridiculous. Another writer trying to relive their uni years by putting pen to paper perhaps. The plot is nothing new and the twist at the end-  was it a twist really?  The writing is just not good enough, it felt like a story you use to get in magazines years ago not worthy of making into a book. For 99p download I suppose essentially that is what it is.",2
6016,Reading by letters. I just can't get in to it,2
6017,"Really disappointed in the Series 9 9095CC, I have been using Braun Shavers for nearly 35 Years.  My previous model was a Series 7 but not only needed a replacement cutter but that the Clean & Renew Charger was broken.So as this was on the New Year Sale at Amazon decided it was a good buy taking into account a new shaver with a clean and renew.  However it is disappointing.  I do have a heavy growth and by late lunchtime I  can have a 12 o'clock shadow and I have found only the Braun range gets as close as you can get with a shaver.  I don't wet shave as when I have tried my face is a mess with blood everywhere.On average I will spend in the morning at least 15 - 20 minutes shaving.Anyway compared to the Series 7 this is poor, I find it only shaves well when you have a growth more than a day well for me anyway, it doesn't seem to shave well on a daily basis compared to the Series 7, even then after a few day I notice it does leave hairs untouched.The only improvement for me is the Clean & Renew, however its a pity I cant use my Series 7 in it.",2
6018,"Really disappointing, by far the elast impressive Braun product I've ever bought.",2
6019,"Really disappointing: the suction cups are difficult to stick down and then sometimes collapse.  We have spent a lot of time trying to black out perfectly clean windows and then, sometimes they are down by morning.  Perhaps our windows are a little small and we can't use the bottom suckers though ... maybe better if they came in other sizes?",2
6020,"Really dissatisfied with the screen protector. I have used JETech a few times and they are predominantly great screen protectors, however when I used this one it has started to peel and leave large airgaps between the phone and the screen protector. I followed all instructions and have applied many other screen protectors including the 2nd screen protector included, to my spouses phone. I would greatly appreciate it if you could contact me regarding this.Regards Joanna",2
6021,Really easy to put on - one was perfect but the other arrived with a scratch all across the middle and was unusable,2
6022,Really fiddly,2
6023,"Really ineffective and weak to paper, feels like it will snap just trying to go through paper let alone card",2
6024,"Really low quality unfortunately.Not finger print free at all, looks terrible after 2 days.The only positive about it is the fast delivery.",2
6025,Really nice unfortunately  the sockers do not work for me curtain does not stay up.,2
6026,really not impressed.No better than my £25 units from another manufacturer.,2
6027,Really poor I had first shave with it after not Shaving for 4 days & it really struggled to clean shave me. I had to go over & over same area pressing really hard to get some hairs. Waste of money avoid purchasing people.,2
6028,Really silly design.  You can't select the programme until the toothbrush is running.  Hence you get toothpaste everywhere!,2
6029,Really was not impressed. The shave was not close enough after using wet razor for years. Tried this on good reviews but dissapointed,2
6030,Received a 2 pack of screen protectors. Could only use one as the other was cracked,2
6031,"Received item,  looks cheap and fake?",2
6032,"recieved the item today and upon opening i discovered that one of the ""protectors"" was smashed to pieces. not happy at all!",2
6033,Relatively easy to apply - ended up with a couple of small bubbles though.  Main issue is that it scratched noticeably within a few days!,2
6034,Returned as the new 'improved' design of the suckers is almost comically unfit for purpose and will not stick to glass.,2
6035,"Returned item.  Flimsy, ineffective, disappointing.  Confused why others rated it so highly.",2
6036,"Returned item.  Flimsy, ineffective, disappointing.  Confused why others rated it so highly.",2
6037,Rubber prints fell off in a few weeks. This almost useless.,2
6038,Rubbish and not nearly as good as a Sonicare. It doesn't seem to hold its charge for 3 days let alone 2 weeks and it simply does not clean very well at all. Really disappointed. Don't buy!,2
6039,Rubbsh! Don't buy,2
6040,Sadly the suction cups don't really stick on the Windows very well.,2
6041,"Sadly, this didn't work for me.  Only because of the area I live In!!!!",2
6042,"Screen got cracked from putting it in my pocket and taking it out, extremely poor for the price paid",2
6043,"Screen itself is thicker than I expected but seems really hardwearing and the touchscreen still works perfectly. Application was easy and although it fits well, from an aesthetic point it's annoying that the protector is about 4mm smaller than the iphone 6S (top & bottom).I thought the screen was great, however after less than a week air bubbles appeared and it is starting to lift off. There were no air bubbles when I first applied it and I put it on a brand new phone which had the original plastic film intact until I fitted the screen protector. There is no dirt or specs under the protector, it is just like it's peeling away from the screen.I'm now not sure how long the protector will last and worried that if I try and remove it, it will leave a residue.",2
6044,SCREEN PROTECTOR CRACKED AFTER 5 DAYS.NOT IMPRESSED,2
6045,Screen protector is small and doesn't cover the whole screen,2
6046,Screen protector is too big for the screen. I've aligned the protector perfectly with the home button and earpiece but there are air bubbles along both sides/edges of the screen. I wonder how long this will last because it isn't great!,2
6047,"Screen protector isn't big enough for the 6s neee to be a abit bigger. The camera, speaker and home button line up nicely but there is a thin line down either side of the edge of the protector exposing the phone screen. Top quality apart fromThat.",2
6048,Screen snapped when trying to remove label twice.,2
6049,"Seemed decent quality well packaged &  delivery quick! ,Got a two pack, however the first one bubbled badly on application which is unusual with these glass ones.The second one went on fine but bubbled after 2 weeks and would not go back on without bubbles.Theyre not as good as previous ones ive had but they were cheaper.i guess the saying you get what you pay for comes to mind.",2
6050,Seemed small for the I phone 6s screen - a large notably visible gap.reduces touch screen sensitivity and fracked easily within a few days. Shame as I was hopeful for this.,2
6051,Seems to cut out and requires switching on and off every couple of days. Becoming more frequent. Its good when it decides to work.,2
6052,Seems to leave smudge marks on the screen and not as smooth as others I have used.,2
6053,Sent me a iPhone S screen protector. Too small,2
6054,Sent them back as I could not get them to pair with my 4 other TP link Powerline plugs. Other TP -Link Powerline plugs work fine for me,2
6055,Shave isn't very close. will probably demote to a travel shaver. My old Remington was better. Wish I hadn't bothered.,2
6056,"Shaver heads just fell out one morning, as far as guarantee is concerned,, where are you supposed to return it?  (to Germany)/",2
6057,Shocked to discover the plug was European and not for British sockets.,2
6058,short battery life,2
6059,Short version: Extremely DisapointedLonger version:I got this machine having had the experience of using a Braun Series 7 790 for over two years. My older machine's cleaning unit got broken and I thought this would be a good time to invest in a newer perhaps a better version of sma shaver. So I ordered a new machine excitingly  hoping it  does the same magic. Unfortunately it was too late since I realised this machine was not any better than the previous one and I had lost the return window. My partner suggested to keep using it  maybe I was being too quick to come to a conclusion. And I did so. I used this machine for over a year now and I got so disappointed so I thought I should share my experience with others.This machine struggles when shaving neck and under chin area. I can not help to stop comparing it with the previous one since I have no memory of finish shaving with anger and annoyance. I am about to contact the manufacturer about this as I hope my machine is defected in a strange way and I am all wrong.In a meantime I am about to switch back to my old device as I can not stand using this machine any longer.,2
6060,Should not have bought it. Very expensive and a complete waste of space. I hardly use it.,2
6061,"Should work well, but the suction caps supplied with it are too big for the window frame.  If it is put directly on to the window, light bleeds through.",2
6062,Shouldn't of bothered with this. It's really not great!,2
6063,Silly gimmicks with Bluetooth.  Get yourself a normal toothbrush for halve the price. Don't be fooled with this Bluetooth rubbish,2
6064,"Simple review, holds the phone well but the clasp doesn't stay secure on the vent so falls off very easily which isn't great if you're driving.",2
6065,"Simple to install, cutouts are very precise and align excellently, however there is an ugly halo that appears around the entire edge of the protector, showing visible distortion to the screen. The protector is also substantially more reflective than the unprotected screen. Coverage is okay, but as stated in the description it does not cover the curved edges, so there is a large gap around the edge.",2
6066,"Since adding my initial review (below), think I will give JACKSON REECE Unscented Baby Wipes 72 Pack a go, instead...First off, these are good baby wipes.  They are pure and odourless, equally as good for wiping baby's sticky face and hands as for cleaning her bottom, and we have been using this make for nearly nine months now.  However, my two gripes are: 1, they have changed the material from which the wipes are made and it is no longer as soft and absorbant as it once was; 2. they are ridiculously expensive unless you can buy in multi-pack boxes - but the company seems always to be mucking about with these and changing the number of packs in their ""value"" boxes.  Not helpful.  N.B, did not realise until just now (from other reviews) that they were no longer biodegradable, and have been putting them in my compost bin... grrrr...",2
6067,Slightly disappointed with the quality of the blind as a few of the suction keep falling off from the window. Unable to achieve Blackout room because of the poor quality of the suction.,2
6068,Slow and tedious read.  A formulaic story.  Never gripped and was totally predictable.  Not a book that I would recommend,2
6069,Slow cook does not work even on high setting. I’m very disappointed.,2
6070,Small crack somehow in the first few days of purchasing!! Not as strong as they thought plus not as responsive as they say!!,2
6071,Smaller than expected. Cannot fit a piece of a4 paper in it landscape which is disapointing.,2
6072,smaller than the size of phone by a few mm. Still offers protection though,2
6073,Smart design. good idea to produce that product but it wont do for me. it was kept falling of the window and was very annoying. maybe for you might work. but it didnt for me. the suction cups were not very reliable.,2
6074,"So called top of the range with a price to go with it. I find it disappointing. I do not have a heavy beard but it takes a long time to get a decent shave, and the shave isn't that good anyway. With the on-going cost of the cleaning fluid I find it poor value for money. I don't use it anymore and have reverted to a blade as it is quicker and vastly better.",2
6075,So far this has not attached to my window as the suckers do not work. For such a high priced item I am disappointed. Will try cleaning the suckers and see if this helps.,2
6076,So far very disappointed. Im starting to wonder it it's faulty. Have to go over and over to get a clean shave ending up having a burning sensation. Haven t dried wet shave so far but it should perform both ways as it is meant to.,2
6077,"So I bought this product when I bought my 6s, right on Christmas. Loved it from the very beginning because it looked like it had great quality. Though, about 2 month later, despite the fact that the protector was installed right after I took my phone from the box (so no dust underneath), it started to peel off. I tried to push air from the spot but looks like the glue properties so now I have a big Air bubble on the screen.",2
6078,"So I brought this thinking it was going to be a replacement for my old iPad (which has seen better days!) how wrong. It's great for what Amazon are selling it as (a kids media device) but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking to have a dual purpose kids/parents tablet (which Amazon also sell it as, hence the mediocre review) When in 'parent mode' or just bog standard mode, it's basically like you're walking around the amazon website, you do still have access to your usual features (netflix, facebook, internet browser...) so that's fine, but when I've been using it I just feel like I'm constantly being watched by Amazon, there's little adverts everywhere, so when you browse to your film collection Amazon tries to sell you new films, when you browse to your home page, they're trying to sell you books and games and all sorts. This really bugs me, it's my device, I paid for it and I don't want Amazon advertising on my home screen(s) all the time - oh and it's practically useless when you're not connected to wifi, so even trying to hide the ads that way doesn't really work!! My final bug bear, when I launched the camera (because, hey I want to be able to skype people from time to time!) the quality of the camera(s) is so poor that it's basically unusable (really really grainy and not at all clear!).So overall it's lost a lot of points for those things. If all you want to do is watch programs, and your kids are happy, then it's great, cheap and cheery. Just don't forget, once the 1yr free kids fire account runs out, they're going to charge you for the privilege of keeping your kids account on the device!",2
6079,So I really needed something like this and it worked okay for a few months - but soon the suction cups stopped working too well and it would fall off half way through the night.I tried l the tricks I knew and even checked online for how to get more suction.Sadly nothing worked,2
6080,sorry I did not like this book,2
6081,Sounds like a bag of bones. Really loud compared to my old Philips Sonicare. Poor battery life too.,2
6082,Speedy delivery but one screen was cracked.,2
6083,Started off great wanted to love it but got a bit far fetched and unbelievable. The characters werent very relatable and I switched off halfway through.,2
6084,"started off OK,  first few chapters,  then it became monotonous,  and the end was farcical... the Law scenes were good at the beginning, and the speeches,  I kept on to the end,  but too many plots, and whilst improbable situations do exist,  too many were provided which weakened this piece",2
6085,"Started to use these when my first child was born back in 2012 and they were fab! So soft and gentle, moist enough but not too much. Some time later I noticed the 72 piece pack was substituted by 60 piece one and the quality dramatically changed not for better unfortunately. They are now rougher, you can't actually feel the grapefruit oil as before, the wipes at the top of the pack are dry and those at the bottom are drown. Still the best ones on the market for me but wish they return back to they used to be!",2
6086,Started using these about a year ago and were great then. Now they are a constant source of frustration as it's difficult to find an end to grab when you do 2 come out as they seem to be intertwined. Will be looking to change brand when current supplies run out.,2
6087,Sticky pads don't hold the weight of the blinds well enough.,2
6088,Still falls down,2
6089,Still struggling to get into this book - Very slow going:((,2
6090,"Still trying to get through this book. Too much going back and forward in time, but determined to see it out !!",2
6091,"Strap is mildly frustrating, syncing is massively frustrating, lacking error responses for bad connection strength. They should have used USB file transfer to transfer music. Bluetooth audio playback was decent enough quality. Coach is interesting but only 3 workouts available. Windows apps are just flaky garbage in general, this one has terrible UI design flaw where the playlist sync is also the playlist removal function so on the first night I spent 40 min transferring music to the watch only to have it tell me there was nothing stored on the watch. I later learned this was because what I thought was the ""sync now"" button is actually add and remove so I had removed the playlist and the watch synced removing everything on it.The screen is good, the reminders and hourly step count is good. The physical button layout, 1 left 2 right, mostly feels inconvenient, if you have physical buttons I would have gone with all front facing and appeased left and right handed users. Battery life is decent enough. Fitbit pay only supports 2 banks in the UK so unfortunately didn't try that. App support is massively lacking, watch face selection is mediocre and there are some premium ones in there which want more of your money. Tracking seemed OK but it missed a sleep stage track on the night there was an OS update which is disappointing.Overall a lacklustre and mostly frustrating experience with a very expensive price tag (£240 at the time) which isn't justified.This product needed more technical capability and the company needs better industry connections so contactless payments could actually be used and the music feature of the watch could be better utilised like spotify or other streaming services.",2
6092,"Strong, durable and robust.... then I opened the packaging it arrived in. It was already broken and cracked.",2
6093,"Such a shame about the suction cups not working, tried lots of different things but could not get them to stick at all. Really disappointed because the blind itself is really lovely, good quality and would definitely make the room pitch black. I really would have wanted to keep it",2
6094,Suckers are crazy and blind is far too heavy to be held by them. Light comes thru pleated parts,2
6095,Suckers don't work properly,2
6096,"Suckers not very effective, shame as product really good quality",2
6097,Suckers to hold to the window are useless.. takes forever to get this to stick to a window,2
6098,"Suction cups don't really work. I ended up taping this to the window. That said, when it was taped up the room was nice and dark.",2
6099,Suction cups don’t stick as they change shape in the packaging. They arrive all contorted. The drawings are ugly and would be better plain black.,2
6100,"Suction cups, half work, half don't... tried all the troubleshooting. Devastated as I thought this would be great and wanted to avoid a proper blind that I'll have to screw to fit :(",2
6101,Suction pads keep falling off and I need 3 to cover a set of bay windows it's easier to just use blackout curtains,2
6102,Suppose its what it says it is.Personally think its a rubbish ideaSuckers don't stick to the window & our window is small ish n its no good!!Its for bigger windows but it doesn't state that.,2
6103,"Suprised at the glowing reviews for this, it stays in the airvent but my iphone 7 wobles around a lot in it when going over bumps and you cannot angle the phone at all, its very basic and i am not impressed.",2
6104,"Teeth feel very clean when used but the battery life is rubbish. Has to be on charge all the time , if you forget, then you won't be brushing your teeth for long in the morning, this is a shame as I had a much older model that was infinitely better and could go for days without a charge so my expectations weren't met.",2
6105,The actual material is fine and does the job well. The  problem is that it simply doesn't work as advertised due to the some of the worst suction cups I have ever encountered! Almost impossible to get it to stay up longer than 5 minutes. AVOID!!!,2
6106,"The actual products is brilliant if it was working. I am giving it only 2 starts and the reson being is the Instant Pot we only bought 2 months ago and one of the functions Saute is not working any longer. In fact when it reaches the desired temperature the cooker switches off instantly. It is truly dissapointing to have your hungry children waiting for a dinner and your total inability to cook, for the sake of a faulty cooker. I am truly dissapointed as only purchased this fantastic otherwise cooker in January, and now i need to return it for repair. Amazon is selling either faulty products as brand new or otherwise i do not have an explanation why a brand new product is working fine for few weeks and than it stops. Thank god i bought an insurance through Amazon, otherwise they would never probablly repair it for me.",2
6107,"The application associated with these Oral-B Bluetooth enabled phones is quite intrusive in that it wants a whole set of security permissions, to access your contacts, your location, your wi-fi, your photos/videos and so on. Whilst some of this is to ""provide entertainment"" or tell you the weather report as you brush, you wonder quite why the app needs to know where in the world you are or who your friend are, and what information it is sending back to Braun.Avoid these extra bells and whistles and just get one of the mid-range models without all the nonsense.",2
6108,The batery is short life,2
6109,The best think I have got from Amazon,2
6110,The blackout blind is a fantastic idea. Unfortunately after about a week the suction pads stopped sticking to the window.  It takes every pad at least three attempts to get it to stick and then at least one of the top ones will give way just as the little one is drifting off to sleep. I am disappointed as I had high hopes for this item,2
6111,The blade not very sharp,2
6112,The blasted thing won't stay up. We already had one of these from our first child and I bout purchased this without even thinking to look at the reviews. Bad move!,2
6113,The blind is ok. It essentially does the job but it doesn't stick very well and it's quite tricky to adjust to the correct size for the window.,2
6114,The blind is very effective when it is up but it does fall off very easily .,2
6115,"The book starts well and the idea of two versions of the same story I thought would be a good idea. However my main problem with this book was I didn't like the two main characters so therefore I didn't actually care what happened to them. The book is full of twists but the big 'twist' I had worked out long before. Might be a good holiday beach read, but for avid crime readers there is far better books out there.",2
6116,the book was good with a twist but i found  I had no sympathy for Beth the character was far fetched and unbelievable,2
6117,The book was too long and the characters were very bland.,2
6118,"The build quality is good. However, it can not cut landscape which is a huge let down for me. I have no use for it anymore. Also, the blade cuts through the plastic underneath. The blade isn't too high quality and you have to press it in a weird way to get it to cut. Basically, it's as much as you can expect for the price. Don't buy if you don't want to cut landscape either.",2
6119,The charging port breaks way to easy and then u cant charge the device.. very disappointed with it..,2
6120,The corners cracked quickly.,2
6121,The device has 2 MAJOR issues.1. You cannot lock the screen while video is playing. So if the child touches the screen the video stops and the parent has to start the video again. This means it is no good for use in a car while you are driving. Even an iPad has guided access to stop this happening.2.You cannot add your own video files to be viewed in the kids profile. You can only view the amazon kids content while you are connected to the internet so this makes it difficult when you have not internet access like on a plane.The positives are the device and case are very well made and the kids content is very good a long as you are online!Amazon need to sort both of these issues out in a software hotfix as I cannot recommend the device as it is.,2
6122,The European adapter shipped with this product does not actually fit the outlet (not wide enough) so I am unable to charge it,2
6123,The European adapter shipped with this product does not actually fit the outlet (not wide enough) so I am unable to charge it,2
6124,The extender throttles our internet too much. Prior to using the extender we get 46-52mbps with the occasional 1-5second dropout while using the extender we get 6-8mbps and more frequent Wi-Fi dropouts. The actually Wi-Fi signal is boosted yes but having done a Speedtest I was not happy with 6-8mbps max on our phones and tablets. The bottleneck May either be in the ringmain in our house or the WiFi signal off the extender. Either way be aware of the reduced speeds if you buy this extender! I’m not happy as I pay for speeds up to 54mbps and I may as well not have the super fast broadband if I planned on keeping the extender in our house.,2
6125,"The fire HD  8 Kids was a Christmas gift for my six year old daughter from her grandmother. Before purchasing we asked whether all features would work in Germany and purchased on this basis. Unfortunately the videos don’t work at all so it’s been very disappointing since we would like to view video in English while in Gernany long term. Perhaps there’s s glitch? The books and educational games are fine. We would not have purchased if we had not understood all features to work abroad, however.",2
6126,"The first book by this author that I have read, and as a result I won't be reading any of her other productions. Pretentious prose: ""I clear my throat and the sound bounces off the tiled walls, which replicate the perfect acoustics of the lobby in miniature"" (page 5). ""With forty-eight hours  to go before totality...."" (page 310). ""My elbows take the brunt of my fall. Two lightning forks of pain shoot up my arms  and fuse at my shoulder blades"" (page 350). ""I knew that Jamie had to die"" (page 403), and the gratuitously violent description of his death (page 374) only adds to the distaste one feels about the entire novel. The author follows the modern trend in telling the reader she had a fabulous editor, a wonderful team of  Agents, learned friends who helped her with the hard bits, someone who used the red pen to good effect, her family and about some of the other people she also loves.... If this review reads unfairly, it's because I found the book one of the worst I've ever had to deal with. The two stars are a simply a compliment to the writer's  industry since the book runs to 404 pages.",2
6127,"The first experience was awful. Making the watch work took 3 hours of syncing to update the firmware. Before the update, it kept with the 'setup' screen. It's continuously difficult to use, and requires lots of work arounds and trial and error.The battery life is really good, but thats probably because Im not using it as a real smartwatch. Im just using the regular fitbit tracking functions.",2
6128,"The first one I went to use was scratched before I even put it on my phone so I used the second one. This has lasted 5 days, so many scuff, scratches and chips out of it already. I am very careful with my phone too and it hasn't been dropped or anything like that, so if I did goodness knows how it would fair! It's ironic but cheaper ones I have bought previously  have been much better quality.",2
6129,The first screen protector was faulty as when placed onto phone the corner was damaged.  Good job there was two in the pack as second one is now in use on phone.  A little disappointed to say the least as usually only ever use one whilst in possession of the phone which is usually two years!,2
6130,"The FitBit App asked me to post a review on Amazon, so here I go.The Good:- Feels physically well made- The screen is bright and clear- The heart rate tracking is good- Battery life is excellent- Sleep tracking greatThe Bad:- So many sync issues you would not believe- Apps are just screens of info laid out in a hard to get at way- Notifications are BASIC- If you are exercising you cannot leave the exercise to use the watch- Desktop app estimates it will take 82 hours to transfer 77 songs to watch (the crashes and brings down my wifi too)- The advertised smart coaching features don’t work / existThis basically a surge/charge 2 hybrid with a nice screen, don't be fooled by the red SPO2 monitor lights - they do nothing (yet, apparently). Ionic is not a smart watch at all, it is clunky to sync, the apps are just other ways to access screens and notifications are for call and texts only with no user interaction.Spent my first day installing and uninstalling software, restarting fitbit, deleting bluetooth profiles etc. to get this working - fitbit themselves were of very little help but did stay in touch via twitter which was nice, glad I had a day off to sort issues out.Given the opportunity I would return this as it really doesn't seem to be market ready yet and is, in my opinion not worth the price, especially when it's essentially the same cost as an apple watch 3.I think in 6 months or so if fitbit have ironed out the issues, sorted the syncing, possibly made a useful app or two and started doing something with the red light sensor it could be great, but not yet.When setting this up, get ready to be frustrated with: 'Looking"", ""Unable to connect"", 82hr music transfer, no Wifi connection, a weather app that works in Fahrenheit only unless you change distance to KMs, fitbit pay only works with one bank in the uK and no support for apple music or spotify!Fitbit are aware of the syncing issues, in an email to me they state: “Furthermore, our team’s aware of some connectivity issues with iOS technology (Apple). When these anomalies occur, we always make sure our engineering team is informed, so that we can keep moving forward in improving our products and services.  We’ll let you know once we develop the solution for this issue” – So why launch if it doesn’t work??SO, in summary - a good fitness tracker with a nice screen, good sleep tracking and battery life, but... not a smart watch, very expensive and very problematic to sync.",2
6131,"The glass is very thick, sharp on the edges, doesn't stick in some places (edges, sides).Good thing is, that it's very easy to put on.",2
6132,"The idea for this book is not bad, but I simply could not get into the characters. They are paper-thin. I can’t “see” them and I can’t “feel” them. As a result, I was not particularly engaged and just kept going to find out what this incredible twist I’d read about in other reviews was all about.Well the twist just made the already-shallow protagonists seem even more bi-dimensional and far-fecthed. I would definitely not suggest this novel to anyone and I am quite baffled that it has so many good reviews. Of course it’s not the worst book one could read, but it just doesn’t have the sparks and thrills a must-read needs.",2
6133,The idea is good.. If you could actually get it to stay suckered on to the window it would be great. Far too much effort and a pain in the ......,2
6134,"The idea is great, but it just doesn't work! It won';t stay on the window! The suction cups just keep coming off & the blind falls down! I only bought it for the holiday, and it doesn;t work! I am very dissapointed! :(",2
6135,"The idea is great, but the product is badly made. I had serious problems with the plastic suckers. Some of them are damaged (probably because they have been in a wrong position for long time and now they are permanently damaged). Again, good idea, but badly executed. Not worth  £22.99",2
6136,The inner cooking pot had a rust Mark just out of the box!,2
6137,"The instructions on how to apply the protector were not very clear however I managed to apply it bubble and dust free.The protector doesn't cover the entirety of the front, in fact it does even cover the screen there are a few pixels visible either side. It leaves the front of my iPhone looking quite ugly.The screen does however still shine through clearly and the colours don't seem to be effected. 3D Touch also works except for the feature of pulling into multitasking from the side of the screen because of it being a few pixels too small.I'm going to keep using it for now but only because it ""does its job"" but I'm also going to keep a look out for a better designed screen protector.",2
6138,The item was damaged when arrived.  Have never had any issues with my purchases before. Hence very dissapointed,2
6139,The major problem with this is that when you clean the head the two foils and centre piece fall out and it is IMPOSSIBLE to fit them back in. This obviously renders the shaver useless.,2
6140,"The material does block out the sun, but the suckers are pretty useless and just fall off quite quickly after being put up",2
6141,The material is great to cover windows I just wish the suction bits were better as they do not stick,2
6142,The material shuts out all light - just the job!Half of the sucker things are useless and come away from the window!So I replaced them with the same type that is used on car blinds!,2
6143,The noisiest toothbrush I have ever used and feels plasticky and like it will break any minute.The handle takes unbelievably long to charge and doesn't last a week.Only plus is that is cleans well when fully charged.Going back to sonicare.,2
6144,The package does not include what is shown in the picture (The package includes only one cover).The cover does not completely out of the edges.,2
6145,"The pads don't really stick, a bit disappointing",2
6146,"The plot to this was decent enough - it kept me turning the page and I got through it all quickly, so in terms of bottom line entertainment it could have been a lot worse.  What entirely spoiled this book for me was the characterisation.  The female lead was INUSFFERABLE! She was the worst type of avocado-munching leftie - self-righteous, precious, an inflated sense of her own integrity (she is a perjurer - but we don't need to worry about that because it was for a good cause!) always ready to judge others and beatify anyone she deems enough of a victim to need her brand of mothering.  The last chapter of the book descended into a self-pitying whine about her martyrdom.  The male lead was weak - utterly under the thumb of his ghastly partner/wife.  The ""baddie"" was sheer stereotype -  good-looking public school boy; we can't have them being shown as decent, can we?!  I believe the author felt she was writing a diatribe on victim blaming - all she showed was a justice system which tests evidence robustly, as one would hope it did.  It merely did not subscribe to the whining female lead's view of the world.  Throw in a strange obsession with eclipses, and you have a basically good book utterly trodden in the mud by whatever clumsy point the author tried to make via her unbearable characters.",2
6147,"the pressure cooking is simple;, but the sauté facility is not, there is no control over the temperature, far too hot for softening/caramalising onions and it's a messy job to clean up, To simmer a sauce needed constant stirring because it was to fast.  Instructions are difficult to follow and the recipe book is not a good one.  I have tried to steam veg and cook a meat stew which were fair but not brilliant;  to be fair I have only had the pot for a few weeks, maybe I need more practice, I have not used the ""slow cook"" or ""delayed cooking"" yet. I'm 75 years old, perhaps too set in my ways to use a complicated piece of kitchen equipment",2
6148,"The product didn't come with the usual isopropyl alcohol cleaning cloth, and the oleophobic coating (or whatever it's called) is not good or completely missing as fingerprints and other dirt seems to be a lot more visible on this screen protector than any others I've had (including cheap ones from Amazon).",2
6149,The product is not as watery as the one from Boots. The logo print colour on the bag is in a washed out colour. I wonder why. It's a shame I didn't keep a bag from Boots to take a picture again it.,2
6150,"The product itself is a really good idea and I was expecting to use for my baby's bedroom window.  However, we have 1930s stained glass windows (at the top of the window) which are slightly frosted.  The suckers do not fix to this surface.  I would have thought the manufacturers might have tested on all types of windows.  We are therefore returning the item.",2
6151,"The products arrived quickly and well packed. I used one protector on my boyfriend's phone and it applied well. However when I applied the second one on my phone, even though I followed the instructions, I ended up with a huge bubble on my screen. And if that wasn't enough, after one day, it cracks on the top without even dropping my phone!!! Not happy.",2
6152,"The razor itself arrived stained with fingerprints and seemed like it was handled by someone before. Keeping that aside, the razers trimmer performs very poorly and fails to do the job well. Would only recommend this for quick shaves, not trim. The shaves will need to be further followed up by blade shave if a clear finish is preferred.",2

6154,"The screen is solid and I would be confident that it will protect the iPhone, however it just doesn't that well on an iPhone 6s. As other people have commented it doesn't fit properly along the edges of the screen and you can clearly see this and the fact it doesn't stick all the way around. I also bought some for an iPhone 5 and it seems to have a scratch on it after only a few days use. Also, when used with a flip case on the iPhone 5, the case pushes the screen protector in the top right corner, resulting it not sticking properly in that corner.",2
6155,The screen protector cracked on the.... 4th day since putting it on. How. How and why. I've had a different one previously and that only smashed once when I dropped it out of a car onto concrete. This one was putting it down on a table. A table.,2
6156,"The screen protector is actually quite thick, which I think detracts from the phone screen. I'm sure I'll protect it well, but I'm going to get a different, thinner one. I also don't like the gap around the edge.",2
6157,"The shave isn't close at all. This shaver seems to skip hairs. To avoid having random hairs being left behind, you'll need to go over the same spots a few times. It also only seems to work when you tighten your skin, which is something to be avoided if you don't want irritation. So overall, I'd recommend against buying this electric shaver.",2
6158,"The shaver arrived with stupid overlarge plug, that only fits in a bathroom shaver socket: I don't have one. So I swapped the plugs for a 13amp plug, and the shaver shorted. My other electric razors arrived with a 13 amp plug already attached to the charger lead.",2
6159,"The shaver gives a disappointing cut, especially for afro-caribbean hair. I have now returned for refund.",2
6160,"the shaver tended to pull out my hair and I did not like it , even though I don't have a coarse beard I could not get it to shave me without pain",2
6161,The shavers works ok but not as good as my old remington. Not as close a shave. However what I didn't realise was that the charger seems to have a continental plug and although it fits the two pin plug it is loose. For a UK supplier I would have expected a UK plug for safety reasons.,2
6162,The smartguide clock didnt work so i got a new brush from customer service. The brush leaks blue light from the side and the stand for brush looks and feels very cheap. You wouldn't expect this at in this pricetag. Also the power cord is too short and a wall stand would be better. Check your quality Oral B guys in the factory!,2
6163,the story started off  as a good  story but then there were twists that were not needed  and you could guess they were coming .disappointed over all.,2
6164,The suckers are incredibly cheap and struggle St stay on the window. The Velcro is good for changing size but that seems to strain the suckers and make them fall off. Going to give a couple more days but might be returning it.,2
6165,The suction cups aren't that good and they started to fall off. Stopped using it.,2
6166,The suction cups don't stick to the window.Returned for refund.,2
6167,The suction pads don't work at all so I had to repeatedly use sellotape to keep them from falling off the windows during the night,2
6168,The suction wasn't great.kept falling off in different places. Got fed up and now its just in storage...wouldn't recommend,2
6169,"The watch itself is a nice piece of kit. When it works. I'm not sure it is the best fitness tracker out there, but if you've had previous FitBit products and are already wedded to their systems, then it works well enough and can support a variety of activities. If you are strictly into one discipline, such as running or cycling, i would look at a more specialised piece of kit for that sport.However, if you have issues with the watch like i did - be warned - FitBit support is now next to useless.I received the watch, had issues setting it up (I had to uninstall the app then reinstall), got it working and then within a week, it stopped vibrating. I'm hard of hearing so it's a really important feature for me. In getting in touch with them, they suggested many things to try (have you tried switching it off and on again?) they eventually nearly bricked it. I got it working again, but it still didn't vibrate.Their solution was for me to send it back to them (and to be fair, they paid for shipping). Once they received and checked it, they sent me out another one. However, they just sent me back a replacement watch unit (the pebble or whatever daft name they give it). Despite clearly saying in their instructions to return it in the box. So i was minus the box and the strap.I complained and they sent me a replacement strap. But they apparently are unable to replace the box. So i complained further - and was told i would get a response within a week. After two weeks of hearing nothing, i chased them. They apologised but said 'we sent you a replacement strap so it's sorted right?'. They didn't even understand the complaint.The only other solution I have been offered is to send everything back to them and they would send me a whole new piece of kit once it had been checked - so probably at least 10 days without the watch.If you have a problem, you're basically paying for a timeshare of a watch that you get to use 1 week in a month.Not impressed.",2
6170,"The wipe so seems to be a lot dryer then the usually, not very good for the price that's being paid!",2
6171,the wipes are much smaller then before. you need twice as much wipes to clean the baby's bottom. it does not worth the money.,2
6172,"The wipes are really good, very wet and run smoothly on baby skin. The fact that there are no chemicals in it should be enough, however I had found black spots in few of the wipes and by reading other reviews it can be a common problem, also the price seems artificially high compared to other alternatives (I would have thought water and fruit extract would cost less than chemicals)",2
6173,"The wipes at the top of the packet are spot on in terms of moisture/absorbency, but the further down the pack you go the wetter the wipes become. By the end of the packet they're literally dripping when you take them out. And you'd better make sure they're always stored the right way up, or placed in a sealed container, because we didn't and some of the water leaked out and ruined a load of nappies in the changing bag!",2
6174,"The wipes themselves are fine, this negative review is solely for the way they are packaged. It's impossible to pull a wipe out with one hand, which is important when you are holding down a screaming baby with the other. The wipes are not interleaved, so you can't use them in a wipes case. Unless you are very careful or use both hands, you end up more often than not pulling several folded up wipes at a time, which you then have to unfold to use. Or, if you're like me, I use several more than I normally would because I'm trying to get the changing done as quickly as possible. No thanks, I'd rather use a washcloth and water and do more laundry.",2
6175,"The wipes themselves are great - totally fragrance and nasties-free - but it is difficult to get them out of the pack one at a time.  If you have one hand on a baby and one hand free to grab the wipes, you end up grabbing 6 and having to stuff 5 back in the box.  Not sure if this is meant to get you to use more than you need.",2
6176,the worst Oral-B I ever had,1
6177,"There are really three aspects to this device; as a toothbrush, with the remote screen and with bluetooth. Bluetooth is not my thing & I can't really envisage a world where I would want to install an app on my phone/tablet (I am fairly fussy about what I put on them) to talk to my toothbrush so I'll pass on that aspect.I decided to try the brush simply as a brush first without the ""smart guide"" for a few days. I've used a number of Oral B brushes over the years and always been happy with them and this one is no exception. It cleans well and works well. It gives you 30 second visual/vibration/audible warnings on brushing which is ok but I find I've tended not to worry about too much that in the past. What I did find was that I had no real way of knowing what mode I was in so I set up the smart guide device.It didn't take long to do that after I'd fiddled a bit and then read the instructions (!) and it has the time on it, a smiley and some stars. I understand another reviewer's comment that the device helped a youngster to clean their teeth properly. Having used electric brushes for well over 10 years now I guess I thought I was doing the job reasonably well however I found the smart guide did help to do it ""right"" as it indicates 30 second intervals and a quadrant to be cleaning as well as the current mode setting. I found this helpful in general and looking at for example getting the tongue cleaning setting almost essential. I have to say I do find it can be slightly irritating too as there are times when I am in more of a rush and end up getting a sad face and less stars so it may work well for some and less so for others.In passing the cross action brush which comes with it is an excellent addition to the range for me. I found it very good at cleaning. You get one of these and three other brushes with this device (not the tri-action one though which is the other Oral B brush I prefer). Is it worth over 200 quid - probably not but there is no reason you should pay that on Amazon and I imagine elsewhere. Is it worth something a bit over 100 quid - almost certainly however unless you really want your phone to talk to your toothbrush maybe go down a model and loose the bluetooth. It is an excellent brush (4.5/5 probably) which is at least as good as my usual brush which is a good Philips Sonicare. I plan to continue using both and will update this review as time goes by.UPDATED after 6 months use.  The problem I have with this toothbrush is the battery.  It takes at least 24 hours to charge it once it is flat and I guess the answer to that is to leave it on the charger when not in use.  However our bathroom simply isn't suitable for that.  However today, halfway through brushing my teeth (!), the battery went from 2 bars to dead inside a minute.  I'm going to give it one more chance and will update this after that however if it isn't more reliable I am going to bin it.  I guess it is the first bad Oral B brush I've had in years but based on my experiences with this one I cannot recommend it.",2
6178,There is a reason this book is £0.99. I really wouldn't bother.,2
6179,There was No screen protection.,1
6180,There was only one screen in the box,1
6181,"These are brilliant for babies with sensitive sore bottoms, but are far too overpriced. The wipes refuse to come out singularly and instead you get a large chunk withdrawn all at once. This isn't great for emergency poop leakages.",2
6182,"These are first Impressions.  I must be the only one underwhelmed with this.  Usually, I 'get' a device or appliance up and running  in no time after  a quick skim through the instructions. This thing seems a bit complicated and has a comprehensive instruction manual.  Whatever happened to quick start, seems one has to plod through every last sentence in the instructions before you can work out how to use it.Additionally, it seems you have to maintain it a bit, eg check this and that part before using it each time for clogged up food.The lid doesn't  just  twist and lock in place ,you need to read the  instructions to explain precisely how to do achieve this. It shouldn't be that complicated.. .You have to clip  some sort of plastic cup(supplied),  filled with water, to the inside before you start.  The inside of the lid has a rubber ring . Just like old fashioned pressure cookers. At some point this ring has to be replaced.  Too much fiddling about for me.The top of the lid has some wobbly nob reminiscent of the old pressure cookers, and I'm thinking, 'oops! spare parts and servicing'.  I thought modern day pressure cookers  had moved away from all this hassle.It made reference to certain foods like, apple sauce, porridge, etc. And not filling above a certain level as they produce a lot of frothing, can boil over, etc so don't do this and that. Might as well use a hop and saucepan.The cycle for rice is about 40minutes, that's more than on the hob, then the additional fiddly cleaning.  All that, and it doesn't bake cakes. I was  wistfully thinking of my microwave, considering a  fancy oven, a slow cooker, induction hob,  Remoska..  Something simple . Anything but this contraption.Since this  pot still has to be hand washed, with all  the fiddle bits, it is no more convenient for me than a hob and saucepan.Unfortunately I only seriously looked at it after about 6 weeks, as initial first impressions was' where do I start' and put it back in the box.Its too late to return, may sell it on or gift it  as still unused. It's just not  for me.It would have been helpful if the video in the listing had shown the setting up and use, instead of talking about the wonders of pressure cooking. I bought it based on the glowing reviews.Relatively expensive for a one year guarantee.",2
6183,"These are good but the packaging rubbish, and it is hard to pull them out without getting about ten in one go. Annoying.",2
6184,These are much smaller than the photos suggest. The back is a very long hook into your ear that looks obvious and unsightly and also keeps coming out. Not too impressed with these earrings,2
6185,"These are now ridiculously expensive, and they are smaller than they used to be.  To be honest I'd still use them for a newborn, but for all else I'd buy Johnson's sensitive wipes (which, funnily enough, are also getting smaller!) instead.",2
6186,These came on time and i was super pleased when i first seen them. I am strongly disappointed that they are being advertised as suitable for iphone 6/6s THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT!! they are the size for iphone 5/5s so leaves a gap of up to 6mm around the outer circumference of my phone and therefore no fulfilling the job as a screen protector!!,2
6187,"These clog really easy and they are a pain to clean.The foil won't come out for cleaning so you've basically got to jet wash it to clean out the stubble caught in the foil.If you don't do this, it'll give a really bad shave.Even when clean, the shave isn't as good as my 10 year Braun foil.",2
6188,These cracked the first time the phone was dropped,2
6189,"These screen protectors are very obtrusive.  The protector does not extend completely to the edge of the screen, and therefore the edges are very visible, especially when dust and other small matter starts to collect along the edge.Positives - I have no doubt that the screen is extremely well protected when this product is applied, also there are no issues with the clarity, or touch responsiveness of the screen digitiser.After two days of wear I took the protector off and put it in the bin as I couldn't put up how much it detracted from the visa appeal of the phone.",2
6190,These screen protectors don’t fit my iPhone 6 (not a plus). They’re too small! I would only recommend for someone using a case that covers the edge of the screen. Apart from that they are thick & good quality but I won’t be buying these again & have already bought another protector I know does cover more of the screen.,2
6191,"These wipes are nicer than normal baby wipes, yes. I have been using them on my newborn daughter from the day she was born.However I have only given 2 stars for 2 reasons. The main reason is the price. Yes they are good wipes but not worth paying that price for. I got the wipes when they were on offer so it wasnt as bad. But otherwise I dont think they are worth the money.However, what really annoys me about these wipes is you cant get them out the packet!!! Its really not something you can do with 1 hand.... and when you are mid-bum-change 1 hand is all you have. You either end up pulling about 6 wipes out together, which you then need to seperate or, you cant get any out at all! Considering the crazy price of these wipes you would think problems like this wouldnt exsit! I think these wipes need the hard plastic top to help get the wipes out, one at a time!Anyway, I think these wipes are ok. Nothing amazing.",2
6192,These wipes are too wet and quite ineffective for thorough cleaning.,2
6193,They are quite pretty and a brilliant price... It is true when they say all good things come in small packages because these are TINY,2
6194,they don't stay on the window very well at all.,2
6195,they r rough made my bbys skin red after use but i chngd il neva use then again,2
6196,"This book really didn't do much for me.  The first third was tedious beyond measure and it was only the advice from other reviewers that made me stick with it, and it did improve.  But not much.  I didn't like the retrospective element of the format and the characters are self-obsessed and totally unlikeable.  So I am afraid to say that I shall not be looking to read any other by this author.",2
6197,this book started with promise  but a big build up had a very flimsy story hidden underneath it - all rather unbelievable and disappointing,2
6198,"This book was chosen by my book club.The format of this book is letters and cables written to each other by the characters. I found this style of writing a bit disjointed especially as there were a lot of characters, and also you didn't get to read all of the letters in a conversation between characters. Sometimes a character would mention something that told to them in a letter which we didn't get to read.I didn't find the topic of the book very interesting and the odd style described above made it less enjoyable to read. But, it's only a short book so I did finish it.I don't think we'll have a great deal to discuss about this at the book club meeting. It's definitely not going to be anything like the meetings in the book!If I had to pass on this book to someone else to read I would probably give it to my neighbour, who doesn't read a lot of books, but really enjoys period drama's on TV.I wonder if she was trying to write a 'modern classic', a love story like something a Bronte would write?",2
6199,"This book was chosen by someone in my reading group and, fortunately, it followed on from a rather dense non-fiction read. From that point of view this was a pleasant distraction, rather lightweight, and an easy read. Of the nine members in the group six really enjoyed it and three (myself included) were rather more critical.Despite the epistolary format of the book, the ""voices"" of the different characters sound almost identical in all the letters. Now, maybe my circle of friends and family are abnormal, but I can pretty well tell who has written me an email (or, more rarely, a letter) without looking at the name at the bottom, because of the style. I think this is a definite weakness.The content is quite interesting and has certainly aroused my curiosity about life in the Channel Islands under German occupation, but I did rather feel that the author picked her facts and slotted them into the novel, ticking off a list.I have to say that at the end it really deteriorated into farce with the Miss Marple-like goings on and the neat happy ending - and all the members of my group felt the same about that particular aspect.I am astounded by the success of this novel, but I can only assume it appeals to those who want an undemanding easy read. This sort of book has its place, but I can't help feeling that it could have been so much better than it was.",2
6200,"This book, whilst being enteraining and easy to read, is extremely superfluous. The characters are incredibly one dimensional and the book fails to scratch beneath the surface.It idealised all of the characters. Turning them into caricatures who are either very very good or very very bad. I'd transitioned from reading ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" to this- one of the key objectives in narrow road is to give depth to characters, to show how someone who is idealised amongst society can and will have underlying flaws.One of the things narrow road also does, is focus on the emotional trauma of war- something this book mostly fails to do. I can understand that it wants to be a ""fun"" book, but when dealing with such heavy issues as the wartime treatment in the Chanel Is, concentration camps and the Burma Railway, it is hard to be ""fun"" they could have at least tried to explore the more complex emotions surrounding these. It's as if the author has just ""dropped"" some of these issues into the book and glossed over them in a superficial and unrealistic way. For ex, homosexuality- one of the characters tells another he's gay and the other doesn't mind at all- whilst it's important to emphasise, especially to future generations, that no one should ever ostracise another due to their sexuality, this completely ignores the suffering and oppression that non straight people faced during this period. The fact remains that people had societal views that did exclude non-straight people and more important still is to show children that this happened and illustrate the pain and suffering it caused so as not to let it happen again.In sum- the book is creative and entertaining. However,  I would not recommend reading as everything within the book is a) predictable and b) the characters/ issues are idealised and not given *any* depth whatsoever.",2
6201,this book's condition was not as good as the blurb said. it looked a bit tired and scuffed and I was a bit disappointed.,2
6202,This came with a European plug only ? Am I supposed to go out and buy a converter? Would be nice to know beforehand! Disappointing.,2
6203,"This could be great but isn't! The size is good and the Velcro to make it smaller is clever. My main issue is that so many of the suckers were misshapen that they did not stick to the window. I tried wetting them, pushing them super hard and bending them back but nothing worked. I now have to trap the corners into an open window and then shut it to keep it up. Really disappointed.",2
6204,This does not last long at all. The product will protect your phone screen but easily chips and then cracks. I now have about 4 cracks on my screen and haven't dropped my phone once. It cracks from being in my pocket with keys or from minor bumps. Other screen protectors I have had have not done this.,2
6205,This hasn't lasted well. I've had it a few months and there are several cracks on the protector. I haven't dropped the phone so not sure how that has happened. Good job there are two. Can't recommend.,2
6206,This is a lovely read but the text in this book is just TOO SMALL to read if you have anything less than 20- 20 vision. I wish I had bought the more expensive Kindle version now. This ruined the enjoyment of this book for me.,2
6207,This is a noisy clumpy toothbrush that is no more effective than it’s cheaper counterpart. I bought 2 and feel I totally wasted £170.00 of hard earned cash because I care about our teeth.,2
6208,"This is a solid and substantial screen protector much thicker than protectors I have previously used. I struggled to make sense of the instructions to apply, firstly them being very small (ended up taking a photo on my phone and zooming in). The dust removal sheet as opposed to a small strip looked great however it crinkled up as soon as I took it off the backing paper and I ended up dabbing it as it simply congealed in a mass. There were 2 alignment stickers I couldn't figure out a purpose for. One to go at top of screen and one at the bottom but what on earth they were supposed to align with I never discovered. These issues notwithstanding the protector went on smoothly and I was pleased with the end result until I tried to use the front camera. Although I had managed to position the protector well the thickness of it impedes the camera and produces a ""glow"" around it. I tried repositioning and then used the 2nd protector provided but no matter how carefully I centred the lens in the opening the photos produced were ""smudged"".",2
6209,This is an ok book but it fails tokeep your ( well my ) interest throughout . Read it and see.,2
6210,"This is easily the worst electric shaver I have had.I was given one by buzz agent for reviewing purposes.I find the lack of long hair trimmer like the other models have a big letdown, as the shaving head cannot cope with proper facial hair and results in copious amounts of snagging and pinching.It really struggles to get a good clean shave, without having to use other shaving products like a razor... so inconvenient.After a full shave with this I was left with irritated skin and rather grumpy, bad start to the day.Mine was only supplied with a shaving socket plug, I have none at home and at least expected to see a UK adapter.It fits nicely in the hand, whether you are left or right handed.  and can get a good charge off of 5 minutes on charge,I have a cool tec shaver, comes with a cleaning dock and does a perfect job every time, spend the xtra £'s and you'l be far happier, buy cheap buy twice.Avoid!",2
6211,"This is good shave machine, but I truly sure that I order the model with the trimmer",2
6212,This is great to use in the shower to have a shave when your face is warmed up. The problem is the battery only lasted 2 years 9 months and then just suddenly packed up.,2
6213,"This is my second Instant Pot ordered from Amazon UK. Both pots were not plated well and have chipped. I returned the first pot and ordered a new one. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. Love the Instant Pot itself, but again, the quality of plating is very poor.",2
6214,"This is not great, it keeps falling down causing much stress as the baby is just nodding off and then bright light fills the room as it falls down. It does stay up sometimes but one of the suckers has also come off now so can only put it up one way and spend time finding the one one that has fallen off so i know not to stick it up that way! Anyway I would try and find an alternative.",2
6215,this is not worth buying as it does not give a good shave it leaves about a days growth on your face also the charging lead is such a bad fit in the shaver that it keeps falling out .I wish I could return it but I threw away the packaging which I might also add was extremely hard to get into never again will I buy a braun product,2
6216,"This is nothing better than a crap tool! ..........After being delighted with my Fellowes Paper Shredder and the quality of it......... I gave a fairly good account of this item, sadly  before I tried the wretched thing out......... BIG LESSON LEARNED............NEVER DO THAT!Having since tried the flimsy thing, I really would like to give only ONE star!How Fellows can sell this item [and people spending out money on such a pathetic item, I will NEVER see the logic in that! I think Fellows need to sack this buyer who's idea it was to buy such rubbish.Wonder now I have tried it.......would they actually like to refund MY hard earned money......I am a 74yr old, not 'very well off' Pensioner. There should be a Law passed to sell such utter rubbish on Amazon!",2
6217,This is probably an excellent product but if all you want to do is be able to clean your teeth don't buy it. I admit to being old but as this comes with a little monitor screen and instructions of use only to people have built their own nuclear missile I had to return it.,2
6218,"This is the first time I felt let down by Amazon. Here are my notes about  using this product in kid mode as well as adult mode:- Adult mode: if you use this tablet in ""adult mode"", not only it is extremely slow and laggy, it does not have any of the apps one would expect from Android, no google playstore, no chrome. Dont even bother, the lag will drive you mad.- Kid mode: The UI (user interface) is inferior to youtube kids', my very young daughter can navigate youtube very easily and learnt it quickly, not the same can be said about Amazon'sAlso, I do not think its possible to autoplay the next video (use case: on a road trip with child in the back seat)Back to the UI: search does not seem to work, videos can't be categorised  and there isn't a way to continue a series where you left unless you memorise it and find the next episode manually.Distributing the youtube kids app would have solved all of the above but due to Amazon's feud with Google, I do not believe its coming any time soon.",2
6219,This item was great for the first few months. Held my phone well (Not suitable for cars with narrow vents like my Audi).However it seems to have completely fallen apart at the 4 month mark. Would buy a different brand next time.,2
6220,"This paper cutter is a handy item to have around the the office but I would advise spending a little extra on a more expensive one.This paper cutter is small and easy to store which is great for when you are using now and again.There is a little surface slightly raised so you can put your card or paper next to it, this is used in all paper cutters, used for getting a perfectly straight cut.Sounds good but it doesn't work, this is because the plastic ruler that the blade is attached too is a little flexible so when you press down you will push it slightly forward or backwards which gives your cut a slight curve,I have used this plenty of times now, and only 3 out of 10 cuts have been straight.The are a lot of measuring guides including little squares and size guides in centimeters, millimeters and inches.The best part in my opinion is the vertical ruler, if you need to measure the size of your cut then this can be done a lot easier as the main surface has a ruler which has an arm built in, hidden underneath, it extends out on a pivot making very easy to get the perfect sized cut, this is also in centimeters, millimeters and inches.All in all this would be perfect if you could cut a straight line every time but you can not so this design fails.",2
6221,This product did not work very well for me. A blade is much fast to use,2
6222,"This product doesn't cover the whole screen so if I drop my phone it will just crack beneath the protective cover. I've bought this twice before and the size was correct so I'm not sure why this has changed, I have a crack on the bottom corner of my phone because this screen protector doesnt reach there.",2
6223,This product says it fits any window but the position of the suction pads make that quite difficult.  Also because they stick to the glass not the wall its not a proper black out of light.  I bought these after reading baby books on ensuring the room is dark to help them sleep but then found out its non essential.  Wish I hadnt bothered.... massive waste of money!,2
6224,This product would be amazing if it just stuck (and remained stuck) to the window!! Argh!,2
6225,This shaver does not give a close/smooth shave very disappointed with this item..Always used philips for over 50 years.Thought that I would try this razor after reading right-upsNow this Item is out of time for return.Will take this up with Braun.,2
6226,"This shaver is dissapointing. I cant get a clean shave and for the money its not worth it, better of buying Wilkininson Sword dispossables for £2.25 to be honest",2
6227,"This shaver unfortunately misses too many hairs for my liking and takes far too long to complete (at least 10 minutes). The shaver never manages to shave off the hairs on my neck, no matter how hard I try! There was a lot more pain involved than expected too with the foil becoming insanely hot after a few minutes.",2
6228,"This system does work, but the way it is advertised is completely misleading. If you buy the kit, as I have, it works (in my case anyway) very well.However, The TP-Link website, and Amazon description says that:""Wi-Fi Auto-Sync for a Unified NetworkAdding additional Powerline extenders for multiple rooms is as simple as plug, pair and play. Once this process is complete, you can manage the entire Powerline network from any extender and the changes will be implemented on all network devices instantaneously.""This claim is coupled with a picture showing a house set up with one TLPA8010P and two TL-PA8730s (see pic)This is not true, in that you cannot add additional wireless extenders unless you buy the whole kit again, and TP-Link do not sell the wireless extenders separately. Forcing you to buy the entire kit completely unnecessarily each time you want to buy a wireless extender.I have spoken to TP-Link about this several times, and they agree that it is an issue, and have promised that the wireless extenders will be available to buy as individual units in the near future.But it has been eight months since I first called about it, and they still haven't released the individual units, and I'm starting to believe that they never will, particularly as a newer Kit has now been released (TL-WPA9610 KIT).I have been completely misled by TP-Link.I would not have invested in this system if they had not told me that they were about to release individual units for sale.If you only require one wireless unit then this system works, but if you want to extend your range and coverage then you will be forced into buying the whole kit again when you only require the wireless unit to extend coverage.",2
6229,"This toothbrush is so noisy, its like someone is using a pneumatic drill in my bathroom. And the battery life is terrible.I had a nice cheap and cheerful toothbrush before, thought this would have been a good upgrade but honestly i wish i could swap it back.",2
6230,"This was a book club choice and I read it with high expectations, given the gushing reviews and its Sunday Times Bestseller status. Sad to say, it didn't live up to those expectations. First of all, it is horribly over-written. Too many similes, too much irrelevant detail, and too many phrases that made me cringe (eg 'Hello guilt my old friend' and 'I'd need the reflexes of a spider and the strength of a bear to wrestle it form his hand...'.) Secondly, the plot is utterly ludicrous and the 'twist' is simply unbelievable. And as for the ending? Oh come on...",2
6231,THIS WAS N OT NEW AS BOX HAD BEEN OPENED AND THEN REPACKED WITH CLING FILM IT MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS IT WAS FULLY CHARGED AND NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CHARGE UP A NEW SHAVER  ALSO BOX WAS VERY SCRUFFY WITH HANDLING  SO RETURNED,2
6232,"This was one of the most frustrating books I have read recently.  So many unnecessary ""twists"" - especially towards the end.  I don't want to spoil this for anyone, so I'll do a brief review here and then, further down, I expand on my reasons (because that part will contain spoilers) and I'll give you fair warning that the spoilers are coming.Spoiler-free review: As previously mentioned, there were too many ""twists"" in this book - and that really ruined it for me.  The story started well, and I was quickly drawn in, but then in kind of descended into farce - with far too much happening in a short space of time.  The story line itself jumped around a fair bit - covering past and present events in quick succession - but was easy to follow.  My other problem was that none of the characters was remotely likeable, they were all seriously flawed in far too many ways.  So, all-in-all, not a good book.***SPOILERS****DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT RUINED****In order to explain what my real issues with the book are, I'm going to take each of the main characters in turn show what went wrong - this will also include the numerous ""twists"".Beth - ok, Beth had problems - mainly stemming from the rape that starts this whole book.  However, some of the things she got up to made her unbelievable.  First, her initial contact with Laura (after the rape and trial) was somewhat forced - but, because Laura had given Beth her card, I could cope.  Second, her treatment of Laura (considering Beth wanted to be her friend) was creepy to say the least - the presents, the photo (I mean, who would do that and believe it was acceptable) and the fact that she was keeping secrets from both parties and never let a hint of it slip.  But I did feel sorry for Beth, as she was the victim.  The majority of her behaviour was believable, if a little wierd.Kit - what an idiot!!! He was such a nasty character  - the lies, the sleeping with Beth and keeping it from Laura, the glass and the fire (mind you, once I knew that Kit had slept with Beth, I also guessed that he, not Beth, was responsible for the glass on the stairs and the fire.  He was prepared to ruin her life to protect his secret - he was horrible.  But he still didn't deserve his final punishment!!! Which leads me on to....Laura - she literally got away with murder, framed her husband, let him take the blame and was happy to do so.  Yet she spent most of the book behaving like a spoiled brat who felt that the world owed her a living.  Funny how she was able to get a well-paid, professional job despite being out of work (and mentally ill) for over 15 years. By the end of the book, I hated Laura.Jamie - why, after 15 years, did he expect that a retraction of a 15 year old statement (the retraction forced from someone at knife point) would hold any sway with any legal person at all.  The guy was completely bonkers - yet still able to function at a high enough level to track down people who had been in hiding for 15 years and terrorise them.Sorry, maybe I am being too harsh as I am sure that Erin Kelly put a lot of work into this book, but it just wasn't one I enjoyed.",2
6233,"This was supposed to be an upgrade from my old Philips Sonicare but overall this is a dissapointing buy as charging takes ages and only lasts for few days, bloothoth and the app are gimmicky and not necessary at all. It does the job but there are better toothbrushes for the price",2
6234,This would be great if you have a completely flat full length window that you don't want to open! this worked at night ok but I had to take a lot of time to get the suckers in the right place..velcro etc.. and then every day take it off again as wanted the bedroom light and open my kids window! found it such a faff that don't use it anymore!,2
6235,"This would have been a great product, but when I plugged in the ethernet cable, I realised that it would only support a max of 100Mbps over the cabled connection. What use is 500Mb Powerline speeds when the device connected to the other side is limited to 100Mb?I will be returning this product",2
6236,"This would have been perfect but the suckers don't suck! Well, some do, but most of them don't so it just falls down all the time. For an item that is effectively just a piece of material and some suckers, you'd think they'd find some suckers that actually work. I've just jammed the whole thing in place by closing the window on it, but this is super annoying. Such a let down.",2
6237,Thought it was great at first but have had it on for just over a month now and it’s randomly shatter cracked at the bottom and gone throughout the screen. Haven’t dropped it or hit it on anything so not sure how it’s happened. As it has shattered at the bottom is it sharp. Hasn’t lasted as long as I hoped!,2
6238,Thought it was great for use in shower.  But within a week my neck was up in spots and a rash. Use only when lazy from now on.,2
6239,"thought this will save time but it takes too long to use for my face, so going back to wet shave....",2

6243,"To date my smartwatches include:Sony SW2Sony SW3Ticwatch EFossil Q Venture (3rd Gen)Samsung gear fit 2Of all of these the Fitbit Ionic is the worst when functioning as a smartwatch.All of the others once connected to my android phones, stay connected. The Ionic drops connection on an hourly basis, even when my phone hasn't moved. After 1 week of use and constant restarting this is basically a rechargeable clock and stopwatch with GPS capabilities. The lack of notifications is only half the battle, syncing with my Huawei Mate 10 pro really is a chore, even when set to 'all day sync' it hardly ever updates unless I restart my phone and watch several times.As it fails to download my data it means my dashboard & data in the app is never up to date. The lag is extremely noticeable too, particularly when coming from Wear OS and Samsung operating systems. I usually set my watches to 10mins quicker than the actual time and to my disappointment there is no option whatsoever to set the time on this watch. It automatically pulls it from your network settings. Even the most basic £5 watch can achieve this. Luckily I purchased this 2nd hand at half the retail price, I plan on selling it straight away in anticipation of the next samsung gear watch or the gear sport. I would rather slightly inaccurate gps readings than this paperweight that fails to deliver its core tasks.",2
6244,To me it’s not any better than one I’ve had for 6years,2
6245,too complicated with unnecessary features. way too loud and way too long to charge (it's been on charge for 5 hours and only 2 out of 3 bars. it will be back on charge in another 2 to 3 days.,2
6246,"Too small for the iPhone screen, which makes it look very obvious. Should have been slightly larger to cover the whole screen",2
6247,Toothbrush good quality esp like the different heads for cleaning gums or teeth etc. However... I bought this as I was hoping to check my brushing on the oral b app all blootoothed from the brush... The brush wont connect so completely useless...! Secondly the electronic thing that I think u use to time brushing doesn't work just flashes numbers erratically... I would save your money and buy the standard brush as I've been disappointed with my purchase.,2
6248,"Toothbrush is great and i like all the extra features. However the battery would show two bars of charge and then cut out after only two days off the charge. I sent it back for a replacement, thinking it was faulty and the same thing happened again! I returned it and bought the 2000 instead as the battery life is much better! Disappointing!",2
6249,"Tried to clean the windows, have them slightly wet... nothing: by the time you approach the third or fourth sucker, the first two have already come off. I didn't return the product because I manage to use it with curtains rings.",2
6250,two stars as I had expected more,2
6251,Undersized on the sides of the screen. I've had a screen protector before and admittedly this one is harder to install and it is thicker.,2
6252,"Unfortunatelly, for my face, the shave is not close at all. I have 2 other Braun models and they shave much better.Pity, I'll be rwturning the item.",2
6253,"Unfortunately I had to return my screen protector as I couldn't live with the 'halo' effect.  There are other tampered screen protectors that mitigate this issue, however these are usually slightly more expensive.  So whilst this product wasn't for me, I do believe there will be some customers happy with the screen protection.Please see below my thoughtsThe good:- Instructions very clear- Easy to install- Excellent screen protection- Good communications from JEDirect- Arrived quickThe bad:- Once installed the adhesive didn't bond all the way to the edge of the screen protector (picture attached) which leaves a 'halo' effect.",2
6254,"Unfortunately keeps falling off, ventouses aren't strong enough",2
6255,"Unfortunately my experience with this product was not positive I'm afraid. I used the product 3 times and on the third shave I noticed the blade started looking different, I've attached some photos. Not sure if it has anything to do with me wet shaving as well as dry shaving. The shave was close enough but I ended up with loads of ingrowing hairs when I shaved against the direction of growth, found that it would have been handy if it had a charge progress so you know when it's fully charged. Never used the beard combs. If you buy this this product consider buying a good storage case for it as the head of the product would be vulnerable if dropped. See the pictures of the blade attached, I contacted Philips and they weren't sure why they deteriorated as they did after such a short space of time.",2
6256,"Unfortunately not my kind of book I had to stop partway in. Slow moving, bland characters who's only interest seems to be solar eclipses? No mention of what they do for a living, or any humane characteristics other than ""omg terrible awful panic im so scarred from the past and resigned to my misery"" or just no real emotion at all. More like a teen fiction. Sorry if you liked it, I'm quite a fussy reader.",2
6257,Unfortunately not useful on my style of window which has a lot of upvc on the fanlight window. When I have time I shall try and cut it up and fix with Velcro. It was bought for use with grandchildren and I find it very fussy.,2

6259,"Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this product. Even for an electric shaver, this product's capability to shave closely is pitiful. It may be a decent tool for trimming hair but best sticking to a rotary shaver for a half decent close shave.",2
6260,"Update: after two years the cutter head keeps coming apart. A replacement is £30! Also I notice that the price of this has gone from £40 in Jan 2016 to £55 in Jan 2018, so thanks Brexit!!.  Would not buy one of these again. Head build quality is crap and the whole thing is noisy. ........ (from 2016)I've had this for a couple of months now. It's alright but not as good as the Philishave rotary shavers I've used. You have to work it quite hard to remove the stubble. A couple of passes doesn't do it. Also it is noisy, it vibrates like a sex toy (I think because the cutters oscillate side to side rather than rotate around an axis) and the head gets quite warm, probably as the cutter oscillates against the foil. I also dropped the removable head and it sprang apart. It is tricky to reassemble and I cut my finger attempting to fix it. I had to get some small pliers, a bright light and a magnifying glass, plus ten minutes of figuring out how not to wreck the head before I could clip it back together. The instruction manual offers no help on this, by the way It'll do but I wouldn't buy another one.",2
6261,"Update: these chip and break really easily. The screen is protected but you end up with sharp edges that can't be safe. Not greatI've always been put off of screen protectors because they seem impossible to put on without big air bubbles being left on show. However, this one is great! It comes with a cloth to prep the screen and then a throwaway sticky sheet to make sure you've got all the dust off. There are also some easy applicator tabs that mean you lower the piece of glass on really smoothly. It went on first time perfectly. Great product. And there are two in the box!",2
6262,"Upsating my review below after buying a 2nd one. Suction cups don’t stay on, most defective and come off after only a few mins.—————The best I have tried. Recommend! It is a bit fidly to fit to size, but still the best out there. The cups are a bit weaker than others but will work perfectly on clean windows; if you have any trouble dampen them slightly.",2
6263,"Used both of these protectors (included), neither fitted flush on a brand new iPhone.After some serious swearing and re-fitting sessions it's almost right now, but it's not 100%.I thought these were the real deal, but seem to be a sub-standard product.",2

The screen is good for the 3d touch for those who may concern btw.Well, arrived on time, has premium package, with nice instruction how to apply etc BUT after following the instructions of how to apply it the result was not as was expecting..when I applied the first glass I had a perfect shape in the most but not AROUND the screen...so i left it like that for few days and researched few youtube links of what i've done wrong and I dont have the perfect apply on my I-phone 6s screen. So After watching youtube videos I desided to remove the first glass and try the 2nd one and was hoping for better result...Unfortunately the result was exactly the same as the 1st one. So I attached few photos so you can have a look..As well since the glass is not thin (!) around it it collects dust as you will see in the photo.All in all a waste of money for me as the result is very bad.",2
6265,"Used this for swimming and within 4 months have had to get a replacement and now the replacement has died. It stopped turning on after swim training last night and will not be getting another. The fact this has happened twice doesn't give me much hope for its ""swim proof"" spec",2
6266,"Using this shaver I found it very difficult to shave hairs on my neck. It didn't matter how many times I tried or which direction I shaved, it was almost impossible to shave some of the hairs on my neck. Also the low battery light only came on after the unit stopped working when the battery was too low to operate. I returned the item to Amazon and got a Panasonic Premium ES-RF31 Wet and Dry Four-Blade Men's Shaver instead. The ES-RF31 has much better battery level lights and charges very quickly. The Panasonic, whilst not perfect, does a much better job of shaving my neck.",2
6267,Very boring and not a thrilling read at all - I persevered even though I'd predicted the end !  Big disappointment,2
6268,"VERY disapointed. Can't actually allow kids to watch downloaded prime videos' unless you then let them watch it on an adult profile. Defeating the purpose of a kids tablet, as then you risk them getting onto apps / websites yo don't want them on!",2

6270,"Very disappointed I have had it for 3weeks,not a touch on my series 5,harsh on the skin,usless trying to shave above your lip,the side cutter is very poor,the charger and cleaner does no clean the razor properly.All together not very happy do miss the 5 series very much",2
6271,very disappointed need a magnifying glass to see them properly rather on the small side and very fiddle to put in  waste of money as I cant give them as a present they are more the size for children,2
6272,Very disappointed with this case as it doesn't fit my iPhone 6s. I tried multiple times to get it on but it was either blocking the camera lens or my fingerprint ID wouldn't work. Glad it wasn't too expensive.I'm sure if it fitted it would be very good.,2
6273,Very disappointed with this product. After 7 months light use the battery has given up all together. It will not re-charge. I have bought an expensive toothbrush that I can no longer use. When it works it is good but I see from other reviews that other customers have had the same problem. I have bought cheaper electric toothbrushes in the past that have lasted years and just as good at cleaning as this one.  All the extra gadgets on the toothbrush seem to use up the battery life and this is something Proctor & Gamble need to address.,2
6274,Very disappointed with this razor as it had good reviews. I've found its just ok to use if you have shaved within the last few days any more growth and you'll find you have to use a regular razor to clean up the remaining stubble the Braun will miss large amounts of especially the neck area.,2
6275,Very disappointed. Can’t get ionic to setup despite following instructions over and over. So frustrating.,2
6276,Very easy to put on but dropped my phone once not even from a height and the screen smashed completely so do not recommend.,2

6286,"Very thick (the home button feels like it's at the bottom of a tunnel) and shows finger prints like anything.  It certainly protects the screen, but I wouldn't buy again and am looking for something better.",2
6287,"Very weak phone holder, doesn't stay in the air vent and slides down unless the phone is balancing on something. Complete waste of money IMO. Can't comment about other cars but don't get it if you have a Seat Ibiza with the round air vents.",2

It seemed well built but the attachable blade just seems flimsey and not suitable for anything other than very light whispey facial hair. The blade had a tendency to get caught up on thicker areas of hair growth requiring multiple passes, especially on the neck which was still a bit patchy after multipe passes going against the grain and caused some irritation after having to go over the same area so much. I decided to return it.",2

6294,"Was not easy to set up and cloning did not work with my Virgin router, also seems to hang sometimes",2
6295,Was not overly impressed. As something to travel with you it could be useful but to use at home it's not the best solution to making your child's room darker. The suction pads are not great so I find some would come off. It's a real effort to put it up and make it stay up. Once it is up it does work bit not done thing you want to be doing daily.,2
6296,Was really not impressed with this at all and returned it after only 2 uses. I am not sure if it is my hair or what but this left sections of patchy shaving on my face.,2
6297,"Was really pleased with this protector at first, fitted my s7 edge beautifully. But after 1 week a small crack appeared in one of the corners which quickly got bigger. Have now taken it off as I don't want it to scratch the screen. My phone was not dropped. I can't explain why this has happened through a weeks use.",2
6298,Was too heavy for the suction pads and kept falling down.,2
6299,Wasn't really what I expected. Probably just me but not my cup of tea.,2
6300,"We bought this (2014 May) for the upcoming trip, however, after trying it out decided to return. It wasn't very easy to put up and take down, but the biggest  drawback was that in the sunlight it would give out such a strong smell of plastic, that we deemed it was totally unusable in the summer time when you would need it most. Also, definitely doesn't work with Georgian sash windows.",2
6301,"We bought this after careful evaluation considering that they have no harmful chemicals.. While this is true, it is unfortunate that most if the wipes at the top of the pack are relatively dry and not wet ..isn't that their main purpose..considering they are wet wipes!!!I would not buy this again for this sole reason..water wipes should at least fulfil the basic need!!",2
6302,"We have quite a few things from this brand but are Quite disappointed with this product as it keeps falling every night, I would recommend to buy back out curtains instead. Useful when you travel and are not sure about the curtains/light where you are staying.",2
6303,"We have used Water wipes on our baby, who is now 8 months, old since birth. We have always purchased them through Amazon as the value box containing the packs of 72 wipes was good value.We recently purchased the new 'value pack' and noticed that the wipes in the new 60 wipe packs appeared different to the usual wipes. They are much drier, have a different feel and smell and it no longer says biodegradable on the packet. We are glad we only bought one value pack of these as they are proving ineffective.We researched and found an online shop selling the original 72 wipe packs. We ordered from there and have found them to be much better quality.Not only does the 'value' pack sold on Amazon now contain less wipes and is therefore not as good value, but the product is also inferior compared to the original. We will not be purchasing these from Amazon again.",2
6304,We needed something to do homework with and this was definitely not appropriate.,2
6305,"Weak  characters, tedious to read. No idea why this got good reviews as a thriller.",2
6306,Well .... sheer frustration with this blind. First tge life of me I could not get the suckers to stick on the window as instructed. I tried everything it suggested and still wouldn't stick on . I can see if you managed to get this thing to work it does give nearly complete darkness....added a pile of stress to bedtimes that I could do without.,2
6307,Well I dropped my phone with one of these screen protectors on and the screen smashed under the screen protector so it offered no protection for my screen. The screen protector remains untouched but it is fully smashed under neath it.,2
6308,"well i was waiting in anticipation of our first lay in for two years with the promise of "" blackout"" but,,,,, the suckers keep coming offwarmed them moistened them but still 3 keep failing to stay put for more than 30 mins. i bought whilst waiting ten weeks for some french shutters to be made. Dawn comes to damn early. very disappointed, my cardboard effort which i have been using for a month was much more reliable",2
6309,"Well it works, which is why it gets the second star, but the advertised rate of 600Mbps is not - I could've bought a far cheaper set of Powerline Adapters that achieve this same goal.I have 200mbps speeds with Virgin Media, and can get exactly that with a straight wired connection, but using these and the same cables I use to get it connected without an adapter, I can get just 100mbps at best, but it is typically only ever 50mbps as I have ran a LOT of consecutive speed tests, as you can see in the attachedThe higher speeds are when I ran a long cable from the router to my PC, while the lower drops are just when the internet was slower, although still via the adapterOverall, I am less than impressed, and would not recommend these if you want speeds exceeding 100mbps",2
6310,"Well this was a disappointment. I have purchased this and it worked fine for about a month and a half when it stopped changing modes and only does daily cleaning, this of course frustrating because i have paid the money to get advange of the options available. . i initially thought it was because there isnt full charge or it needs to be and therefore did not give it much attention. 5 months later after trying different ways from fully charged to syncing it with the app it did not work and have requested for a replacement online. unfortunately there was no replacement and a refund was issued by Amazon.",2
6311,Went on fine but all the edges lifted after a few days :(,2

6315,"When I first had this shaver I thought it was great and really did a great job, but over time it would seem that the motor started to struggle after what was only daily use and finally died today. Just checked the receipt and its a month over the 12 month warranty so not that impressed really as I would have expected it to last a bit longer.",2
6316,"When I first received the earrings I was pleasantly surprised how nice they looked. However once I went to put them in my ear, it was almost impossible. The hook is so flimsy it could snap at anytime. The hook is very small, I can't get a grip. Don't think I'll ever be able to get them on without breaking them. Shame because the crystal looks really nice.",2
6317,When I fit this ..its look nice and smooth but after only 10 days it's look like coming out and I can't fix.,2
6318,"When I heard about these Water Wipes I thought they sounded fab! I wanted to use as natural products for my baby as possible so these seemed to be the perfect solution to the night time nappy changes (usually use just water and cotton pads). But unfortunately they were a disappointment. Very dry, making my baby's bum red. Won't be using them again. The very last few in the pack were wet though so seems like all the wetness had gone to the bottom of the pack.",2
6319,When I opened my package one out of the two glass protectors was already cracked from top to bottom!!! Very disappointed in amazons quality of this product!!!!,2
6320,When I put the first one on my new phone i couldn’t get the air bubbles out so ended up throwing that one away. Put the second one on and eventually got all the air bubbles out.,2
6321,"When I received the Braun Shaver I ordered, the first thing I noticed was that the cellophane seals had already been cut open on the box. I opened the lid of the box to find that the shaver was well secured in a shaped plastic mould...but the rest of the bits, power cable, cleaning brush and manual all look as if they'd been just thrown in, and as to the manual itself, it has somebody's handwriting within its pages???The Shaver itself doesn't look as if it has been used and works well and therefore, I think I'll keep it....it's just the fact that I thought I was purchasing a brand new product.",2
6322,"When it stays up, it works fine (no jokes please!) However, the suction cups don't work very well and it's not uncommon to have to try several times to get them to adhere to the glass.",2
6323,"When this blind stays up, it’s great!! But it is a struggle every single night to get it to stick to the window. Often one side will fall off, taking the rest with it, so we will wake up in the morning to a light room which plays havoc with insomniacs!We have resorted sometimes to using rope to tie it to our curtain rail, just so it would stay up, but that isn’t as effective as it still lets a lot of light in. Very disappointed after reading so many good reviews and the product video making it look easy!",2
6324,When you mix this with faster TP links the speed of those devices drops to the speed of this device. So v disappointing.,2
6325,"While this might be good for young kids, it's more grown up version is useless. Amazon, if your going to survive in the tablet world, you need to drop this rivalry with Google. I can't be using Alexa to play music, and Google Home to do my serious stuff. Oh and sort out the US getting cooler features over the UK on the Echo series - I'd like to wake up to music in the morning here in the UK, not the default alarm.",2
6326,Will be returning this smartwatch as the Google Fit app which came free with my phone is much more accurate in tracking my walking activities.,2
6327,will not adhere to window. Useless,1
6328,Will not hold charge for more than a few cleans so needs charging more than you use it to clean your teeth.,2
6329,Worked fine on the first week. Then I found that it ran out of charge incredibly quick. After 5 uses the battery ran flat. So disappointed.,2
6330,worked perfect for 2 days hence the 2 stars then would not pair with my phone i tried everything so i am returning mine and getting a series 3 apple watch which is MUCH better for 50 pound more it is worth it even a series 2 is better which can be found for 219 pounds,2
6331,"Worked reasonably well to start with but after minimal use with paper and thin card, the blade quickly became blunt and left a ragged edge.  Have owned it for just over a year, so too late to get a refund.",2
6332,Worked well at the start but go's blunt easily. And. Ruler bit easily bends or bows upwards,2
6333,"Works fine, you have to give it to Philips, it is groundbreaking. However, the blades themselves are ridiculously fragile. Once the razor slips out of your hand into the sink - the plastic on the blade itself cracks rendering it unusable. It's been 2,5 months since I've bought it in May, both blades crashed so far. I am not sure if it's worth buying these blades that often. As per the advert, two-pack of blades for £20 every 8-10 months would indeed seem reasonable. IRL though they break twice as fast. Need to rethink the purchase.",2
6334,Works ok - however doesn't do a good job. Have to finish off with a razor which defeats the point.,2
6335,works really well....when it stays up...the suckers are rubbish....cleaned the window like the instructions said...bloody thing falls down or wont stick at all....great!!,2
6336,Would agree with other low reviews - this doesnt cut the hair that well.  Bought this for my son who has a bit of fluff around his chin as he is 15 and it can't even deal with that without being brutal on the skin.  Looks nice but not fit for purpose.,2
6337,"Would not cut through 160gsm card, which description indicated it would, so returned and got a more heavy duty trimmer. Would be suitable for thin paper but no good for thicker paper or card.",2
6338,Would work really well if it's stay up!! Also mine has loads of gaps where you have to put the Velcro together to make it smaller so the Suns still getting in! Wouldn't recommend very fiddly!,2
6339,wouldn't actually stay suctioned to the window for more than 5 minutes. very disappointed.,2
6340,Wouldn't stick no matter what. Followed instructions watched videos nothing sadly. Kept falling down into my sons cot. Returned full refund given.,2
6341,Wouldnt stay up and wasnt dark enough for me,2
6342,"Writing a review in the hope the makers of this product read these and make changes. I love these wipes as they're chemical free, but they drive me MAD as you can't get one at a time out of the pack. They come out in clumps that I then have to stuff back in. For the price, what a waste! Not to mention highly difficult when you have a wriggly baby with dirty bum in the air.Also, for the price they charge the packet should have a resealable plastic lid that clicks back on.",2
6343,Written as a series of letters I just found that I couldn't get into this at all and abandoned it half way through. Not for those who like flowing proseor perhaps a book you can sit down and get you teeth into. It might appeal to fans of Adrian Mole with it's similar way of being constructed. Not for a middle aged geezer though.,2

6345,"Yes, they are often inexpensive but cheaper shavers, like this one, aren't particularly good. have to shave again half an hour later.",2
6346,"You have to apply an unusual amount of pressure while cutting, which means that it invariably fails to cut through the paper. May be it's a safety feature, but I think it's more likely just down to cheap quality.",2

I had to apply ridiculous amounts of pressure to my face, it was ripping my hair out still, even made it bleed! It has now left my face all red and senseless and to add insult to injury, it leaves patches of hair which no matter how hard you rub, remain on your face meaning you have to go over them using another razor or machine!I have Mediterranean heritage so it could be my thick hair, but as far as I'm concerned it's still unfortunately turned out to be a hideous product despite the reviews.",2

6353,1) Doesnt cut anything above 220g A4 without leaving marks on the edge2) Plastic holder bends every time you cut3) Plastic bar that the cutter slides on gets pushed down and doesnt come up again unless you pull it up and its so annoing4) Plastic under the cutter get cut too and makes a canal under so after 20 cuts its going to start shreding the paper from the backI dont recomend this product unless you need to cut 10-15 papers and your ready to pay this price for it,1

6358,8 months from purchase and one speaker is broken on the kindle fire.,1
6359,A complete fiddle to fit and even then kept falling down. Sent back for a refund as not fit for the purpose. Also couldn't open our sash windows with them attached which is useless in summer.,1
6360,"A complete waste of money. I bought this item because my previous Braun had a broken link to the trimmer (nothing that I did). I read the reviews and this seemed to be a good item. But I have not found it to be as good as the older, cheaper Braun nor as good as my 12 year old Phillips (still going strong).It takes me a long time to shave and even then there are parts of my face which look unshaven. Far quicker to wet shave (but maybe no as convenient).Definitely not worth the money and I would advise going for a cheaper model.",1

6364,A tedious read to say the least.  Why oh why  is this on Richard & Judy's Best Read List?  Extremely disappointing read.,1
6365,"A very poor razor for the money. I bought this to replace a Phillips portable razor (under £15) which was better. The only advantage in this one is a beard trimmer and its waterproof. Its quicker to wet shave once, than make multiple attempts with this razor. Never buy Braun again, since it appears its forgotten most of Dieter Rams advice on design.",1

The book is sooooooo slow and boring that I managed to flick through quickly just to get to the end as I hate giving up on books - mind you, this is one I should have.  It's annoying  that I HAVE to award a star -as it certainly doesn't deserve one.",1
6369,"Absolute Garbage! Does not shave hairs on neck, or for that matter hairs on many areas. I bought this to replace a Philips Rotary Shaver basic model I got & used intermittently since 2008, the replacement heads for that cost over £22 so I decided to buy this based on reviews & the fact it was on special offer. The shaver looks good & is well made, but is simply not fit for purpose, shaved twice so  far on one days growth using good quality Gillette shaving gel & unbelievably my old Philishave with well over use by date cutting heads (Basic model, remember) gives a far better shave! Just trying to figure out how (If possible) to return this & get my money back. P.S. I wasn't expecting miracles from an electric shaver, I know they cannot possibly shave as close as a blade, but this thing struggles to shave anything at all!",1

The horrible image of a moth in my mouth will stay in my memory far longer than this turgid book..",1
6379,Absolutely awfully weak screen.,1
6380,"Absolutely dreadful. This is advertised as A4 but only cuts on the shorter side. This, in my eyes, is ridiculous advertising and is not fit for purpose. An A4 paper cutter should be able to cut an A4 piece of paper on ALL sides.The cutting is also questionable as it only managed once before struggling!",1
6381,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! No idea how people are shaving with this. Got it for my boyfriend and it didn't remove most of the hair and instead irritated his skin. I couldn't believe it so I give it a quick try on my legs to see if it was just his type of skin...terrible! Does absolutely nothing but irritating the skin. A total waste of money!,1
6382,"Absolutely horrible.I got the package today, excited to be able to protect my phone. I found out that it didn't even stick to the screen - it was stuck on by STICKERS. Whose going to leave stickers on their phone? Next, he walked upstairs with the protector in hand and opened a door. The protector smashed. More than this, tiny shards of glass flew onto my body and itched me. I had to wash my arms. Incredibly unsafe and unrealiable.",1

I read the reviews before buying and they were mixed, I decided to take a chance and buy in anyway, but only one of the suction cups stuck to the window, I battled with it for over half an hour and gave up.  I made arrangements to return the product and promptly forgot so now it is now also a waste of money that will end up in the bin.",1

6390,"Absolutely useless. No wonder it was so heavily discounted. This toothbrush is supposed to come with a European plug but it came with a non-standard 2-pin plug that does not fit in ANY socket in my home. I bought 2 of these, one for myself and the other for my husband, but have to return them because they're useless. Total waste of time.",1
6391,"Absolutely useless. Quicker to mow the lawn.No help either from Braun or Amazon, disgraceful!!!Braun contacted initially, and I was told it takes time to adjust to one's skin.

6397,"After all the great reviews I was really looking forward to receiving this item. Well, what a let down.  It does not stick to the window for any length of time, despite cleaning and moisting and then cleaning again and moisting...etc., and it whilst it allows you to Velcro down the length to adjust, it does not thw width so you have it hanging to the side. Such a shame as had such high hopes. My advice - buy an eye mask!",1
6398,"After believing this was a good product, and needing a new set of foils (same price as this thing), I purchased this. I have to say it performs worse than the old model, and is especially bad at neck hair. I have received countless razor burns from probably frustrated use and going over the same area loads of times. This razor cuts unevenly, and isn't what they say it is, never use it to dry shave because you won't get what you are looking for in a quick shave! It is not an improvement on the old design, and really poor for more sensitive skin. So it you want cuts and failed shaving, buy this product!",1
6399,After buying this for my partner as a Christmas present he used it once then it didn't cut his beard properly we thought it needed charging and we charged it all night and still doesn't work properly it catches on his beard hair and leaves bald patches where it works properly then stops.

6402,"After trying other makes of electric razor and giving up getting a close shave. Until I purchased a Braun mobile shaver, a small very cheap ( £16 at the time) which gave as close as a blade shave. After owning it for a year or so I decided I would try the Braun series 3 at home rather than a wet shave. I've tried it out a few time's but have ended up going back to my mobile shaver to get a closer shave in places on my neck. Time will tell.  I am sorry to say but each time I've used this razor it has caused razor burn which for days after you end up with sore skin.

Using these are much more difficult than they used to be.",1
6405,"All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet, 8"" Display, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof CaseExtremely disappointing - never had this lousy an experience setting up a tablet. The whole purpose of it was to watch movies when we travel internationally. We set up a profile for our son, and were unable to view any videos and received a 4527 error. On calling they told me I needed to switch to a uk profile to resolve that issue and I did, but then couldn't switch my store. They couldn't help me over the phone and had to do it behind the scenes and call me back later. At that point I couldn't see any videos at all, and it appears that my Fire for Kids Unlimited free subscription had disappeared. They've still been available to help me. This is supposed to be an easy to use device intended for kids, and I can't do something as simple as easily set it up and watch videos when my child travels.And oh, whatever genius decided to create this probably woke up frozen from 1999, and didn't even think of how to focus on offline access. Devices like this for kids are useful for road trips and airplane rides, but someone at amazon thought it would be a good idea to only make videos work when you're online.Oh, and whoever decided to call this a tablet for kids, likely has never interacted with a child. They didn't even think of something as simple as locking the controls out when a video is playing so your 4 year old in the back of your car can't stop the video and make you pull over and restart it - like guided access mode on iOS devices. This is frankly a shockingly bad product from Amazon. They normally have teams that do a phenomenal job anticipating customer use, but appear to have put their worst product and app developers on this one. Don't bother with this, get an iPad like I should have in the first place. The aggravation will cost you way more than the price savings. This is honestly the worst product I've seen from Amazon. I simply cannot think of anything they've blundered more with.",1

6412,Annoyed as I exclusively express to feed my baby. This has stopped working twice and I've had to order a replacement again. Would swap to another brand but I bought loads of bottles and accessories that fit lansinoh.,1
6413,"Annoying to put up, the suction caps kept coming down just too much hassle! They were good at blocking light but only if you could get them to fit perfectly.",1
6414,"Another disappointing product from the Gro company. Most of the suck caps don't stick to the window, and the room is not blacked out. A complete waste of money.",1
6415,"Apart from the fact that it cleans your teeth, there is not much positive to say about this. Any 5£ toothbrush can do that. For the price though, it is an utter disappointment. I have had the toothbrush for over 6 months now, but it stopped working properly after the first 2. I'm usually a lazy person, and never write reviews because ""hey, as long as it does its job, who cares"". But now I realize for the price I pay, its not worth it by a long stretch. Let me list all my complaints which I had to deal with after 2 months of use (some even from week 2):1) Takes literally over half a day to charge. Tried everything, changed power sockets, adapters, completely cleaned it. It doesn't charge properly and is dead after half a week of usage.2) The extra functions are a gimmick. Apart from the cuteness of having the timer telling you how long you have brushed, the other features and changeable heads are not worth the ludicrous extra price which is charged compared to other electric toothbrushes.3) It's very difficult to clean after use. Even with water, a towel, etc. Through the genius design of the thing, the residue water and toothpaste still manage to get into the cracks between the head and the toothbrush. Meaning I wake up to this toothbrush being filled with dried out residue from impossible to clean angles. Never before had I an electric toothbrush designed so profoundly wrong.Again, don't want to sound spiteful as I have don't usually write customer reviews, but after so long of deciding ""ah whatever I'll manage"", I couldn't go on anymore. I could never recommend this overpriced junk to anybody. My previous 20£ ones were infinitely better. (and easier to clean)",1
6416,"Appalling battery life, only get 2 decent cleans out of it, before it runs noticeably slower; this is from day 1, and it gets no better! I thought it was a lemon, and tried another but got the same performance.My previous Oral-B was a considerably cheaper model, and yet the battery life and speed were leagues better, even after 10 years!!Finally Braun have seen sense, and switched to lithium-ion for their latest brushes (Genius 9000, 8000 and Smart 6), I'd opt for one of those instead, or Philips Sonicare, as they're all li-ion.As if that wasn't bad enough, the pack-in brush heads seemed to rust badly on the first and second brush I recieved, so much so that I chucked them and switched to ones I'd bought separately...it started corroding the brush post!",1
6417,"Applied nicely and easy to put on, but once there it scrstches and is sooo brittle it just breaks away! Had mine on for two days and it just snaps !",1
6418,"Applied this product to my phone, a few days later I accidentally dropped my phone and instead of the screen protector protecting my screen, my screen actually cracked. So this is  in fact useless!!",1
6419,Arrived 1 broken and other didn’t stick to screen,1
6420,Arrived broken,1
6421,Arrived broken both glasss not happy,1
6422,Arrived broken very disappointed,1
6423,"Arrived broken,",1
6424,Arrived in the post with both screen protectors completely cracked. Would not recommend.,1
6425,Arrived on schedule but one out the two screens was broken when it arrived. Were cheap though so didn’t bother trying to send back as the second was fine,1
6426,Arrived quick but one of the screens in the is cracked wouldn't bother again.,1
6427,Arrived this morning. Both screens cracked. Straight into the bin. Complete waste of money,1
6428,Arrived with non compatible plug for the UK!,1
6429,"Arrived yesterday morning and used for the first time last night. Fantastic at blocking out the light for my 6th month old, but feeding him at 7.45 am this morning there was a loud crack, as if a bird had hit the window, when we removed the blind we discovered that the double glazed window had cracked and broken due to the heat generated as the early morning sun hit the black of the fabric. We are shocked that this has happened when such a simple design change (making the glass side of the blind white - exactly like other black out curtains) would prevent this from happening. I really wish I had never bought the blind as now we have to replace the window",1
6430,"As a lot of other people have wrote the brush was great to start with.  About 3 months in I noticed that it didn’t hold its charge as well.  Now after 11 months it won’t hold a charge at all.  For what this has cost I really would have expected better.Confused as to why Oral B/Braun have not reacted to these comments as it is a clear design/manufacturing issue, possibly through the addition of the Bluetooth feature.  I definitely would not recommend this product and would advise to buy a different make altogether.",1
6431,"As a trucker I'm away and thought this would be a nice clean shave, instead of wet shave, more convenient, less hassle.  On the second shave things weren't going smooth enough. Now it just takes too long to keep going over the same areas. It's just not cutting nice and clean. Back to wet shave I guess. Very disappointing.",1
6432,As dull as dishwater,1
6433,As far as I'm aware it's not legal to sell electrical equipment in the UK without a UK plug?? How am I supposed to charge it up??,1
6434,"As good as these wipes are, being water, trying to use them is a nightmare! The first half of he pack are completely dry, the bottom half drenched in water. They also stick together, making it very difficult to get any out, which when you are trying to change a bum quickly, is a nightmare.",1
6435,"As many have said, very gimmicky and battery life is appalling. Buy the Pro 2000 instead and stack the Subscribe & Save heads in the next sale...",1
6436,"As per other reviews, suckers don't stick on glass so it constantly falls down. I hoped this would be a quick and easy solution but unfortunately not!",1
6437,"As previous reviewers have said, these wipes are not as good as they used to be and I'm TOTALLY disgusted that they are no longer biodegradable. I think the manufacturers are disgusting, basically tricking people by pretending to be a decent company, knowing full well most people aren't going to check the packaging constantly.I notice that Sainsburys sell lovely natural wipes made by Jackson Reece called Kinder by Nature, which are biodegradable and often on offer, so we are switching to those. We are also going to try washable wipes as they could be washed with our cloth nappies and will be better for the environment than even biodegradable ones!I've only given these one star because I was forced to by the computer, not because I think they are that good!!! They are zero stars really!",1
6438,AS soon as I pulled the plastic covering off the screen protector cracked,1
6439,"At the moment I am not happy with my purchase.  I bought this for my 8 year old because of  all the wonderful benefits of parental controls and it being kid safe.  I have set all the controls, and am furious to find that a prime video (Stan Lees Lucky man) we watched tonight is available on my sons profile, I have deleted from our library, checked the remove content in the manage child profile and still it is available to view, now sure the open seen of a body washed up on the beach is in any way appropriate.",1
6440,"AVOID! I purchased it having never used a kindle before and the software was faulty - was on the phone for TWO HOURS with tech support making me do scripted tests (that I wasn't able to - for example, it wouldn't even swipe, there was no home page or even a home circle button!) they finally agreed it was a glitchy one and sent me a new one. Started with the same issues and this one doesn't have the free kids unlimited subscription that is supposed to come (neither did the other) - both just have an error page pop up to say it has not been added to the tablet and to call customer service! Should've just bought another iPad.",1
6441,Awful,1
6442,"Awful and overpriced for a piece of blackout fabric that just never sticks. And when I manage to get a few of the suckers to stick, they coke off one by one. Very disappointed",1
6443,"Awful do not buy!!! Mine arrived today with one screen protector already cracked and the other one would not stick! I followed the instructions clearly and it still would not stick. I have bought this same one previously it it cracked really easily, it is not strong at all! Definitely WOULD NOT recommend",1
6444,Awful doesn't stick to Windows was sent back straight away,1
6445,AWFUL Don't waste your money-back it up with a razer,1
6446,Awful if you have any kind of case on your phone. The claws aren’t deep enough to hold the phone. #designfail,1
6447,Awful product do not buy,1
6448,"Awful product. Nearly all of the suction cups simply didn't work. We followed the directions on the instructions page suggesting ""simply roll [the suction cups] between fingers or place in warm water for 30 seconds to restore normal shape"", neither of these suggestions was of any use at all. Will be returning this item.",1
6449,Awful quality item!,1
6450,Awful tablet. No memory and the sound went funny after two months and was replaced with a refurbished version. As this is all they can do apparently. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,1
6451,Awful useless product. It doesn't stick to the window at all. I will be returning it.,1
6452,"Awful, doesn't stick to windows. Would definitely not recommend, waste of time/money",1
6453,"Awful!!! Advertised on website and packaging that this is for iPhone 6 yet it doesn't even have a hole for the camera. I have used this type of product many times before and had no problem applying. Both of these have lines down the screen protector so it's very difficult to see your phone. I followed instructions to the letter, applying both exactly as described yet they look awful. A complete waste of money!! Do not buy!!",1
6454,"Awful. Half of the book was about eclipses which had no relevance whatsoever and was tedious to read and understand. The author seemed just to want to make up the pages by talking about eclipses and it was so boring. The twist in the story was weak almost pathetic. Not happy to have paid for this book, should have read the other reviews. My fault :(",1
6455,"Awful. I bought this as I was unable to buy new heads for my Phillips rotary shaver. It does not give a good shave, misses bits, even after going over the same area 3  or 4 times.",1
6456,Awful. They don’t stick and drive you mad as they are impossible to put up.,1
6457,Bad quality plastic.Doesn't stick.,1
6458,Basic electric toothbrush with no special feature except pressure indicator. Not worth the price.,1
6459,Basically this lasted for the 2 years of the warranty and now is not working properly. Whilst it was working it would be 4* or more but now the spindle to attach the heads onto swivels meaning the toothbrush head swings away or slips from the tooth surface. It cannot be repaired apparently so it is now useless. Certainly not worth thee money for only 2 years usage - buy the cheaper models as we only use 1 or 2 of the 5 speeds available and you can use an app on your phone to time yourself. I wont be buying this again. 1 star,1
6460,"Batery very poor quolaty, requores 24h charging ,:(",1
6461,battery dead after 12 months and 2 weeks. Low quality for a big price. Avoid,1
6462,Battery dead less than 3 months after purchase but  2 months after return window closed,1
6463,"Battery died after 6 months use it just won't charge. This is why the 1 star. While it was working it was a 4 star due to my issue below, but in every other sense as good as its predecessors.The other issue I had, but this is just a minor, that with this toothbrush after every 30 Seconds it gives the same signal which is a pity as one doesn't know how many 30 Seconds are left. I know that for most who are looking at the app or the SmartGuide this might not be an issue, but I am often using it while showering and in that case it would also be good to know where I am with toothbrushing. The previous models all gave 1, 2, 3 or a long beep after each 30 Seconds. I had several Oral-B electric toothbrushes previously and loved them all.Regarding the app, I couldn't bother to download it, although it may be brilliant, but in my opinion it is just one step too far. I just don't want my mobile to occupy every bit of my life (it almost does anyway). I may be wrong on this.",1
6464,battery does not last at all!!!!,1
6465,Battery failed after 6 weeks.,1
6466,Battery failed after 7 months use,1
6467,"Battery has completely died less after less than a year of use. Annoying - 6 months ago I would have given 5 stars, no question.",1
6468,"Battery Kaput.Loved my 5000 series but after 3 years I could tell it was starting to lose power.Bought the 6000 series in a lightning deal last November but kept using my 5000 series until it was finally on deaths door. Last week I charged this up for 24 hrs, used it once and placed it back in its charger. It started making funny buzzing noises whilst on charge so I removed it and had look at it. There were no outward sign of anything wrong so put in back on charge and it remained silent. I went to use next morning and the battery was flat, now will not hold a charge. Complete waste of time & money - very disappointed",1
6469,"Battery last only 2 days, and charge  time takes more than 8 hours.. Not happy with the performance, when cheaper Oralb toothbrush have way better battery life.",1
6470,"Be aware! The heads keep breaking and the replacements are around £50 each time. The replacements are poor quality and difficult to find. Costs spiral out of control very quickly! The cleaning station is also extremely noisy and vibrates heavily. This was a gift to someone and I now feel embarrassed with all the issues they have with it, not forgetting the additional cost of expensive and poor quality replacement heads.Not even worth one star!",1
6471,Be careful on what yourlooking for with this.I thought it might cut paper easily too.It is not easy to use at all.I recomend its best to pay extra for the right trimmer.ALWAYS READ WHAT IT EXACTLY DOES AND TEST IT WHERE YOU CAN.,1
6472,Been using these for 18 months. The wipes have recently halved in size and the quality of wipe reduced.,1
6473,Beware these wipes are much smaller than standard size sold in supermarkets.,1
6474,BEWARE they are now significantly smaller than before - tiny and rubbish at wiping poo!!!,1
6475,"big mistake this is useless, have tried wet and dry, 1 day,2 day growth does not touch any thing, its now back in the box in the cupboard. not sure on returns policy for this thats why i have still got it DO NOT BOTHER.",1
6476,Bit rubbish.  Not sharp blade and can't do more than a 1 or 2 papers at a time. And doesn't give very clean cut,1
6477,Blackout blind is effective and easy to put up.  However after a few weeks use the rubber suckers used to stick it to the window tore off......his blind is not suitable for daily use if you plan on removing it regularly for example.,1
6478,Blind will not stick to window. Have cleaned window down about 5 times now.... give up! I would not reccomend.,1
6479,"Bluetooth doesn't work with Samsung S5. Trying to pair it manually asks for pairing code, not listed in the manual.The app tricks you to thinking is connected by activating using the phone microphone.  That's why the app need the microphone  in the security settings of the app.You can prove this by turning on your electric razor and shaving and the app thinks your bruising your teeth !!!There is nothing different that the 5000 series.  Don't buy it if you think the bluetooth will work.",1
6480,"Blunt after a few weeks ,Braun has a good name my old Braun razor is 10 years old and still going strong,this one very very disappointed with it I only use it once a week,maybe the Warehouse deal wasn't so good after all,I was too late to return it,as I was on holiday!!!",1

6483,"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!",1
6484,"Boring, slow, tedious. Every time I picked this book up hoping that I'd get into it, I failed. The pace is far too slow. I have decided today to give up. Well done to everyone who saw it through to the end - i really did try to get to the part where it started to get interesting but failed. Thank goodness I only paid £1 for it, it's heading straight back to the charity stand where I got it from.",1
6485,Both arrived already broken in the package!,1
6486,Both of the glasses arrived already cracked,1
6487,Both phone screen protectors turnt up cracked and went straight in the bin.,1

6489,both screen protectors arrived broken. not a satisfied customer!,1
6490,"Both screen protectors came cracked and with minimal instructions, neither of them were sticky either.",1
6491,Both screen protectors cracked after few weeks.  Not tough enough compared to other males,1
6492,Both screens were brokenAs they were only a couple of pounds it wasn’t worth sending them back,1
6493,Both screens were shattered and bent!!,1
6494,"Bought 2 at the same time. One for me and one for the wife. The wife's broke and she said I had taken the good one and gave her the bad one. I bought 2, and never knew one was bad and the other was good. Got a sore ear for 2 days, and then mine broke. So did I get one good and one bad, or did I get 2 that are bad. Now lets all send our electric toothbrushes away for repair and go manually whilst they are in for repair. Seriously, 2 that break in less than a year is ridiculous.  Do not buy this model as you will either end up with a soar ear or a sore head!!",1
6495,"Bought 2 for Christmas and for my twins to use on holidays over the new year, thought they would be simple to set up and use? Not so!I tried and thought I had downloaded loads of games before we left (after having to set up accounts and email addresses etc before it would work) but whilst we were away we couldn't get anything or any game to work?Very disapointed.I'm sure it's probably my lack of knowledge/ability but after so many hours you just think it's not worth it. ;-(",1
6496,Bought 2 of these at £70 each and neither work. They won't even charge. Can't seem to access Amazon for replacement or refund. Help!,1
6497,"Bought a Kindle fire for my grandson and as a pensioner I try to budget throughout the year so thought I was being prudent by buying it in November so that I still had money in December for Christmas. Boy was I ever wrong, tablet duly arrived in a sealed box which I wrapped immediately and waited for Christmas. Imagine my and my grandson's disappointment  when opened on Boxing day we discovered the item was faulty. Never mind I said, Amazon promise a no quibble guarantee, we can exchange it. WRONG because the item was bought more than 30 days before they will only change it for a refurbished model. Now I bought this in good faith as a new item now all they will give me is a refurbished one. Surely the 30 days should run from the date the device is registered. when I asked for my money back they offered me  an Amazon gift card. After much argument they have now agreed to a refund. Moral of this story. If you are buying something for an event ie birthday or Christmas don't buy it more than 30 days in advance or better still go elsewhere.",1
6498,"Bought in Black Friday deals on offer as a Christmas present for my son. Went to wrap it up but thought I would switch it on before and set it up ready for christmas day, except it wouldn't switch on. Charged it with the charger supplied and nothing. Amazon customer service were not helpful, wouldn't replace and could only offer a refund of the original price i bought it for, even thought it was more expensive to buy a new one. Spent 40 minutes on live chat then 10 minutes on the phone. For once Amazon customer service was terrible and overall not happy with the product or service from Amazon. Has put me off.",1
6499,Bought it as a present. Gimmick. Stick to more simple versions. The battery life (as noted by many other reviews) is poor and now the product is useless. My simpler - and older - one is still going strong. Sometimes what you pay for is not what you get.,1
6500,Bought it yesterday wont turn on,1
6501,"Bought it, wished I had not.",1
6502,"Bought on the back of the beck beards rating this highly - big mistake , very poor cut that's next to impossible to get a close shave .. back to the fusions I go",1
6503,Bought several packs but two where full of black mould. I had been using one pack on my newborn when a few wipes in i noticed. Will never use again. Putting my baby at risk of infection. Sent both packs back and got a replacement!!! As if i would ever use this product again. I wanted a refund at minimum. Shocking customer service!,1
6504,Bought these and did nothing to protect my new phone.  Will cost me £100 to replace screen!!!  Tried to contact the company and not interested,1
6505,"Bought these pre-baby and was excited to use them once he'd arrived - but they gave him nappy rash very quickly so we stopped using them and went back to just cotton balls and water, and the rash cleared right up.Personally I""d avoid these - just use WATER!",1
6506,Bought these wipes for my new baby after hearing great things about them. Used them when she was about a week old as it states suitable from birth. Made her bottom bleed! Horrified! Watched it happen as I wiped her poo away little springs of blood appeared. So upsetting. Never had that with johnsons sensitive wipes with my first two children and used those really early on too. Can't say it's worth the extra price. From reading other reviews it appears they've changed their quality so this may explain why it's caused my daughters bottom to bleed. Too scared to use them now. Very disappointing & upsetting,1
6507,Bought this 16 months ago. Battery now won't hold more than 2 days.  I didn't expect to have to replace a toothbrush as expensive as this every 18 months. Outrageous price for something with such a short life.,1
6508,"Bought this a Christmas present, thought it would be a perfect gift but what they don't tell you is that the kids unlimited doesn't work in ireland, doesn't say that ANYWHERE on the description!",1
6509,Bought this as a Christmas present at end of October whilst on offer. I didn’t register it till Christmas Eve to get full use of subscription. Within 3 days it for some reason kept muting and I couldn’t get sound back without switching it off and on again. Within 7 days it had stopped working all together! Wouldn’t charge and wouldn’t switch on. I have contacted amazon 3 times and they would only give me a refurbished replacement!!! I understand I bought it end of October but I expected to get a brand new one as it stopped working after only 7 days use. I’ve now got a refund but still not totally happy as I’d got it when it was on offer and would now have to pay another £30 to get a new one!!!!,1
6510,bought this as a present for my son battery lasted about an hour then stopped working it was replaced with a refurbished model not happy!!,1
6511,Bought this because I thought it was time to update my electric razor and amazon discounted the price by like 50%. Hardly ever leave reviews but honestly worst razor I have ever used in my life. It made my face sting for ages afterwards even with moisturiser on and one time cut my face up and made it bleed. Used it in the shower with shaving foam and absolutely awful. Never using it again,1
6512,Bought this device to allow my son to watch videos when visiting restaurants and staying at hotels.  Privacy settings which you cannot change prevent you from connecting to WiFi.  This is on the adult and child setting. Amazon are unable to resolve.As a result my son still has to use my well know other brand of phone or tablet to watch his videos as they are able to connect without issue.Really disappointed in the product and customer care in this instance.,1
6513,Bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter for months later charge it for 24hrs and it lasts 30 seconds constant low battery waste of money,1
6514,bought this for my hubby worked fine as a dry shaver but when he used it wet it has cut his neck quite badly,1
6515,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Lasted 3 months before realising battery life kept depleting just after a day even charging for ages! Contacted amazon, now been fobbed off to oral-b to sort. Really disappointed. And paid quite abit for it too",1
6516,Bought this for my spare room which I use from time to time. The fabric itself is fine for blocking out light but the suction cups will not stick or hold any weight. Those that did stick temporarily are sensitive to moisture and temperature changes and lose grip very easily.  I will be returning. Dont waste your money on this over priced product. If you really need temporary blackout for sleeping I would say get some cheap eye masks instead.,1
6517,Bought this item as a gift in November and the shaver head broke in December not impressed can't seem to get hold of anyone to complain to as think I should be entitled at least to a new shaver head.....,1
6518,Bought this prodduct a week or 2 ago. Used twice and it just rips and tugs at the hair. After 2 uses the foilf head is damaged and is now useless. Absolute waste of money,1
6519,Bought this product 4 weeks ago. Needs charging every night and even then it lasts less than two minutes.,1
6520,Bought this product but the power plug is a 2 pins power plug. This power plug never used in UK.First I thought I can use the adaptor so bought 2pins-3Pins adaptor and it didn't fit the 2 pin adaptor!The space between 2 pins are very narrow so can't fit in any of the 3 adaptors I have bought.very disappointed with this product.,1
6521,Bought this product for my boyfriend for Christmas and it's never worked since he got it. He can't use it unless it's plugged in on charge which is a massive hassle for him as his bathroom doesn't have a socket. Haven't had much luck with electric shavers for him but I was very disappointed that I bought it brand new and it was broken.,1
6522,Bought this toothbrush to replace my old Braun toothbrush.The new toothbrush has a good cleaning action.It's let down by the fact it needs charged after FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES uses. The old toothbrush I have  is ten years plus and still holds its charge longer than the new one :-((((,1
6523,Box arrived open and soaking wet. It damaged the other items that were included in the parcel (books). I cannot comment on the product as I won't be using it given that it appears it has been tampered with. I am very disappointed.,1
6524,"Braun Series 9  9040s Wet & Dry Electric ShaverThe sales blurb on this electric shaver made it sound absolutely super; however the reality appears to be far from that with the two gentlemen that I got to test it.'  First tester was my husband, who has always electric shaved. He prefers the foil style shavers rather than the Philips rotary heads, although it is far too many years ago to remember when he last had a Philips!My husband is an older man and does not have a thick facial growth now, and only needs to shave once a day.  He found this Braun to give a good close facial shave and was well satisfied with it. He found the Long Hair Trimmer very good to trim sideburns.Being able to clean the shaver by rinsing under hot water was a nice feature, rather than just dry brushing it out. However he did not feel that to be able use the shaver whilst in the bath or shower to be of much benefit and is more of a gimmick.David thought that for the price, this Braun Shaver should have a better quality case, and also a protective cover should be supplied for the shaver head.  The carry case should also be bigger, to also accommodate the Shaver Power Socket, Cord set, Brush and Oil Bottle, all of which would be required when travelling. He also felt that for the most part the User Guide was easy to understand and fairly thorough.' My second tester was my friend's husband who is considerably younger than mine, and who has a strong facial growth. He has been wet shaving for a good 40 years and not used an electric shaver during that time.Rob tried the shaver both wet and dry on 1 day old stubble, 2 day old stubble, 3 day and 4 day as well. He found that each time, and it did not matter if the shaver was being used as wet or dry, that he was always left with patches, however long he went back over them. When wet shaving he used shaving cream.  He could not recommend this shaver at all.Like my husband, Rob said that the shaver should have a protective cover. He also said that he found it very big to hold.Unlike David, Rob found that the User Guide was not that good in that there was nothing specific in respect of wet shaving.So, mixed experiences by my gentlemen testers.I found that the box packaging was very unimpressive and lacking a 'quality look' given the high price tag.  It is also very strange, in that the box 'lid' is underneath it! As well as the comments from the guys concerning a head protector and better case, I did think that there should perhaps be a stand for the shave to sit on when not in use.The User Guide is printed in 7 languages including English and the wording is backed up with illustrations.  Because it is not specific to this particular model of Shaver (Braun Series 9  9040s Premium Shaver Wet & Dry) not everything that is shown in the guide applies to this model.  Obviously the manufacturer is aiming to cut cost by producing 1 brochure to cover about 9 different shavers, but in my opinion, this is not good for the customer.It is recommended by the manufacturer, that the Foil & Cutter Cassette is replaced every 18 months in order to maintain maximum performance.The shaver has a 2 year Guarantee with limitations and commences from the date of purchase. To get service under the Terms of the Guarantee, the shaver must be taken or sent to and Authorised Braun Service Centre, together with the receipt of purchase. Details of the service centres are available online.Given the mixed experiences and the omissions in what is provided, this is what my star rating is based on.UPDATE 17 July 2015 - Today, having been using the shaver for a while, my husband has gone back to his previous one as he says that this Braun is not performing well and he is having similar problems to those that my friend's husband had.  I have one more gentleman who I am sure will do a test on this Shaver for me and will provide another update in due course.UPDATE 18 July 2015 - I have just heard back from my 3rd tester, a young man in his 30's.  Matt has had the same experience as Rob in as much as not all the facial growth was removed and he had to finish off with his usual razor.  He reported that on the straight, smooth surfaces it was ok, but was absolutely useless over any contours of the face and the head of this shaver was just too large to shave the area between the top lip and base of nose.  He was extremely surprised by his findings as he had seen a lot of advertising on TV for this Braun Shaver, and given the RRP, could not believe how awful it was.Well folks, that is 3 totally different men, in age and facial growth, who have tried and tested this shaver, but who unfortunately did not find that it did the job.  Given their findings I have to now change the Star Rating from my original 3* down to 1* and this Braun Shaver has now been dismantled and taken to the Council Disposal Facility.  A great shame.",1
6525,breaks after a few months not worth it,1
6526,Broke after 2 day's usage. I'm sending it back for a refund.,1
6527,broke after 2 months.,1
6528,Broke after 3 months!!,1
6529,Broke after 5 months,1
6530,Broke instantly,1
6531,"Broke on the first day it just stopped charging, phones for replacement as the deal was 1 year free replacement, but was sent out a reconditioned one, refused to send out brand new one which it was what I wanted as we barely got to use the first one which was bought for Xmas day. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL",1
6532,Broke soon after I purchased it. Just found it in my glove box and went to see if I could send it back but I’m over a year by a couple of days. So that was a waste of £7.99,1
6533,"Broken after 3 days charger will not plug into the device,sending a refurbished one to replace the brand new one. Wouldn’t expect a second hand replacement for a brand new faulty item.",1
6534,Broken easily. Not durable as advertised,1
6535,"Brought this item to trim some photos. It does manage to cut items, but if you want straight and easy cuts this item really doesn't work great. The guillotines I am used to working with usually drop below the item to be cut so you can just slice away. This trimmer requires you to push down to clamp the paper to be trimmed, and then pull the blade across. Unfortunately you need to push down quite hard to clamp your photos (in my case these were small fiddly bits so that made it harder), hence it is hard to get a smooth cut. On top of that, it felt like the cuts were slightly off line, most probably because of uneven pressure applied by my hand! The blade isn't that sharp either, sometimes getting the cut and sometimes just scoring the material. This item would be much better if you could clamp it with an automatic device rather than your hand. I may have have missed how you are supposed to use it perhaps? As it stands I wouldn't recommend this, I can honestly say I can do a better job with scissors.",1
6536,"Brought to help our five month old son nap during the day. Takes a long time to get into position, and once it's in place falls off within minutes allowing light to flood in. Tried all 'useful' tips for remoulding the suckers into shape but frankly spelling more time trying to hang this than he's napping for.",1
6537,"build quality not too great for an expensive electric toothbrush.........my Oral-B vitality electric toothbrush, which was a lot cheaper had better quality and fell........waste of money.",1
6538,Buying this wanting to use it straight away but it comes with and American Plug knowing it's a British buyer and still no adaptor...poor,1
6539,came broken. don’t buy.,1
6540,Came with one pack short.Box holding 8 pack of wipes instead of 9. Feeling ripped off.,1
6541,Can never pull just one wipe out at a time.,1
6542,Can not believe you can't share music on child's profile... Yes it may have loads of apps and videos etc but for them not to be able to play music is ridiculous in my opinion.,1
6543,can't believe anyone could give this five stars. Only read 30 pages and completley bored. Who come up with gripping? Waste of my time and 99p,1
6544,"Can't see where I'm cutting, and everything slips.",1
6545,Can't use in my Fiesta as everywhere I put the phone it's obscured by the steering wheel.,1
6546,Cannot stop really annoying (and not age appropriate) pop up adverts. Pretty useless really.,1
6547,Carnt get to the hard to reach,1
6548,Causes condensation at window. And is a pain putting up & taking down each time. Though it does stop so much light getting through. Blinds would be better.,1
6549,Charge does not last long,1
6550,Charger stopped after 4 months. Looks like a common issue with these brushes so phoning customer service now.,1
6551,"Cheap, nasty...get what you pay for.",1
6552,"Cheap.Dull.Useless. The three words which i would describe the standard of this product to be, which i'm sure many of you would agree with. So you may be thinking, why would he say such a thing ? After a few weeks of solid usage, the blade no longer continues to work at the standards which I expect. When i initially used the blade i was not very pleased as you had to press down with force for it to cut however at times it even failed to cut a piece of 1mm paper, which was rather surprising and upsetting at the same time. Although i had paid a good price for the guillotine i was expecting it to still be operating after 6 months at least.It wasn't like i was cutting up people heads or something. Good thing it came with a 1 year guarantee.",1
6553,Cheaply made.. broke after 3rd or 4th use,1
6554,"Chrome NOT silver and Gillette / Braun UK Customer Service were utterly clueless. They had NO explanation as to why all of the pictures and descriptions show a Silver shaver and not a chrome one.The chrome finish is tacky with a capital ""T"" and manages to make this top of the range (not to mention expensive) shaver look cheap and tacky and simply not a £200+ item. The build quality isn't even particularly good and my 12yr old Braun feels solid as a brick compared to this.Hugely disappointing and Im afraid that's the end of my £0+yrs of buying Braun.",1
6555,Clock has stopped working even after new battery was insterted. No return available,1
6556,Comes in pack of 2.. one came broke already so couldn't use it and the other one cracked the day I put it on.. these are supposed to be tempered glass so it doesn't allow your screen to get damaged.,1
6557,Compact size and great price. The only down side is it can’t cut anything. I guess that explains the price....,1
6558,"Compared with the 4 pack you save 0,25£ ??? What about some bigger savings! Like the ones you used to give when you had the 15 pack? Please, have some more respect for your customers! Who really love your wipes, but aren't dumb!I'll change this review as soon as you have a REAL value pack.EDIT: On my last package I also note the changes others are stating, the biodegradable statement has disappeared from packaging and they also smell different and the wipes seems more spongy when inside the package.",1
6559,"Completely agree with the latest reviews - product quality changed drastically for the worse!! Seller contacted and they admitted that wipe quality has changed, but were not prepared to offer refund or  replace product (with the original quality wipes). They claim that the new wipe material is the same as that used by leading (supermarket) brands... So they take the same wipe material as eg Pam**** but rather than adding some cleansing concotion to it, they add pure water with a squeeze of citrus (no doubt very expensive ingredients... Ha!) and then charge you 2.5 times as much as e.g. Pam**** would... Hmmmm... Quite some Value Pack! And it is no longer biodegradable - which was quite a major selling point!  I feel this constitutes False Advertising as there is no mention of these horrible changes in the product description on amazon, so you don't realise that you are being scammed by DermaH20! AWFUL, ANNOYING and very DISAPPOINTING. Am going back to extra large cotton wool pads soaked in boiled water with a few drops of tea tree (or other natural product of choice, maybe even some citrus extract!) - much better value, keeps well in a small tupperware container and practical for on the go too!P.S.:  as ever, can't fault Amazon.co.uk - quick and easy transaction and delivery - shame about the product!",1
6560,"Completely appalled.Wipes have shrunk in size drastically.We were not informed, not has price been reduced.Being scammed.",1
6561,Completely died after 2 weeks of use.Do not buy this.,1
6562,Considering its rrp I think they are cheap looking. I am ok to have them for the price I paid but they are not worth over £100,1
6563,Could not cut with it. Ordered Cathedral A4 Rotary Paper Trimmer which was brilliant,1
6564,Could not get into this book. Each chapter jumping from one character to the other.... Not my kind of book,1
6565,Could not get this to stick to the windows at all! Driving me absolutely crazy trying.,1
6566,Could not understand how this was a 5 star book.  I was so disappointed in all the characters and all the errors in the book.  Spoiler alert: Everyone lies no one has any morals or ethics.  Very sad.,1
6567,"Couldn't bring myself to read past chapter 7. Didn't like either the  degree of  all their interest in eclipses or any of the characters who were too  self involved, self conscious and, basically, selfish.",1
6568,Couldn't get into it at all.  At half way I gave up!  Turgid and totally unrealistic.,1
6569,Couldn't get it to cut my 2 day stubble. tried for 5 minutes but my face was sore but the stubble was still their.Looks like I am still a slave to the Gillette Corporation,1
6570,"Couldn't get it to do what it was meant to, So sending back as maybe faulty",1
6571,Couldn't get it to stick at all. Suckers don't work or aren't strong enough to hold the blind up. Had to buy something else in the end.,1
6572,"Couldn’t get into this book at all, gave up half way through! Found the main character too annoying and overall just agonisingly slow!",1
6573,Cracked within 3 day’s of putting on my phone,1
6574,Cracked within the first day very flimsy and has still cracked under the protection screen do not purchase if you want you glass screen to stay intact,1
6575,Delivery was fast. Been using water and cotton pads for a while now so decided to give theses a try. Made baby's bum red so won't be using again.,1
6576,Delivery was quick but the shaver itself is not up to  scratch.it doesn't give me as close a shave I would like. The quality of the shaver itself is good.,1
6577,Delivery was ridiculously long. Didn't get this product got an alternative instead and the backing were not fish hooks. Insanely disappointed. Will be returning them asap as the earrings I recieved we're not the ones I ordered. Utterly disappointed.,1
6578,Description was misleading and did not specify how many packs. I received 9 packs which worked out at £5 per pack..  Tesco and boot sells for £2 per pack! Not worth it.,1
6579,"Despite being a "" German ""product the plug does not work on the Continent. So bring an adapter on holiday! No idea why Braun insists on stopping UK customers travelling abroad with their razors. German two pin plugs  work perfectly fine in UK razor sockets. Can only assume Braun is not happy with Brexit.",1
6580,Despite going through the instructions thoroughly these blinds do not stay up! Don't waste your money!,1
6581,Device was defective from the start! When I complained just weeks after activation I was offered a replacement- then discovered it was a refurbished unit! It's not ok to replace practically brand new units with refurbs!!!,1
6582,"Did loads of research and was really excited to set it up in time for sons birthday, bought expensive san disk card but couldn't work out why wasn't recognised, turns out every time put case on the tablet flexes a little and loses the SD card so doesn't think there is one in there.  Managed to get case on one time without the problem but then with slight rough handling it lost it again, might just have duff one but now have no tablet for his birthday, cheap build and even using the tablet felt a bit laggy at times compared to an ipad, guess you get what you pay for, shame as on paper looks really good and based on other reviews might just be a build problem with this one.",1
6583,Did not charge and got sent back,1
6584,Did not find this gripping in any way,1
6585,Did not give me a clean shave. Going back to a normal razor.,1
6586,Did not met the expectation of quality,1
6587,Did not shave properly or cleanly and at times didn't shave at all. Struggled to shave a simple short stubble. Just Terrible.,1
6588,Did not work .,1
6589,didn't fit my iPhone 6 and 6s,1
6590,"Didn't protect my screen at all, i dropped my phone and my screen smashed... useless",1
6591,Didn't stay up for even 10 minutes.Not easy to put up,1

6598,"Didn’t receive this item. Disappointed, received a pack of colouring pencils instead 🤔",1
6599,"Didn’t stay up for more than 30 seconds, tried wetting the suction cups but it didn’t help. Added to the stress of trying to get a baby to sleep!",1
6600,didnt like this at all,1
6601,Died After a month,1
6602,Disapointing looks cheap poor quality will be returning,1
6603,Disappointed,1
6604,"Disappointed again after using Oral-B toothbrushes. It stopped properly working after 4 months - the sensitivity sensor started flashing even when there was no pressure on anything at all, making the toothbrush unusable. Also charging time increased to over 24 hours. For me it's time for Philips now.",1
6605,Disappointed had this delivered on 3rd of march not even had this item 2 months and its broken wont turn on,1
6606,Disappointed they are smaller than they look.,1
6607,Disappointed this screen saver doesn't go right to the edges of the phone.  There is a border of 2mm all the way round that is left unprotected.I will replace with a better fit.,1
6608,"Disappointed with the goods. To thin and flimsy,",1
6609,Disappointed with the last order. 2 packs were completely dried!,1
6610,"Disappointed! :( They just don't stick to window. Great idea, but not so great quality!",1
6611,Disappointed. Can't get the suction cups to work. Keeps falling down. Too expensive for what it is.,1
6612,DisappointedSuction pads don't hold put them up before bed falls off an hour or so laterDefeats the point,1
6613,Disappointing read. Started well but I struggled to finish it as I became more and more bored with the story.,1
6614,Disappointing. You do not get a very close shave. In view of this an already tedious task takes even longer.,1
6615,Do I have to give this as many as one star? That's too many.  Nonsense. Full of  people that cannot exist in the real world.,1
6616,DO NOT BUT IF YOU HAVE THICK FACIAL HAIR!!,1
6617,"do not buy this oral-b 6000 at all. after 6 months, the battery died completely. After one full charge, it last 3 seconds. Whereas my Philips tooth brush still work perfectly after 1 and half years, and still using it.",1
6618,Do not buy this product!!!!! bought August 4th 2015 and by the 27th of January 2016 it wasn't working at all & Amazon won't replace it. As it was £79 also I am really annoyed as it wasn't cheap & I thought I was getting a decent product. POOR PRODUCT & very POOR from AMAZON!!! Ps would score 0 if I could.,1
6619,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!I spent 10 mins trying to shave with it and the only hairs it took of my face were ones that got caught in it pulling them out painfully. I want my £50 back,1
6620,"Do not buy this product. It doesn't stick to the window (even with drying the window, wetting the sucker thing etc...), it's the most irritating thing and I wish I hadn't wasted my money!",1
6621,"Do not buy! First one broke in days, an hour on phone for the replacement which arrived Wednesday and broke today (3 days) with exact same fault. By the way, the free replacement is a refurbished model. Getting iPad instead. Also customer service appalling.",1
6622,DO NOT BUY!!!!!Really poor quality put one on my phone dropped it on a carpet and the glass smashed aswell as my phone,1
6623,Do not buy. I put this on my phone a week ago and the screen is cracked already. My phone fell from a small height and the screen is cracked below the screen protector.,1
6624,Do not buy. This product broke immediately as soon as I tried rotating it gently. Poorly made.,1
6625,do not recommend both of the screens delivered smashed and also the cleaning products left marks on my actual phone screen,1
6626,Do not think this product is easy to use ..... most disappointing waste of money & time falls off any surface in about twenty minutes unless it's hot ...then  half of that.Perhaps the idea is to have them fall asleep then wake them up when if falls down!,1
6627,Do not use this in hot weather or have the sun shining on the window you are using it on.A horrible burning plastic smell will start coming from it,1
6628,"Do not waste your money! ""Suction"" cups offer no suction! Product might be good if it actually stuck to window. Can't believe they can get away with selling something so non functional",1
6629,Does not even stick to the window,1
6630,Does not give a good shave,1
6631,"Does not provide clean shave after trying even for 10 minutes. In fact, the £15 Gillette shaver is much better than this.",1
6632,does not shave as close as I had hoped,1
6633,does not shave clean!,1
6634,Does not stay up. Will be returning.,1
6635,"Does not stick at all, very disappointing",1
6636,"Does not stick at all! You can get two or three suckers stuck before the first one pops off. I once managed to get all the suckers stuck on with help, only for the blind to fall down 5 minutes later. Disappointing and a complete waste of money",1
6637,Does not work at all. No suction produced.,1
6638,Does not work. Used it twice and I have to swap to razor in order to cut my beard.,1
6639,Doesn't cut the hairs- absolute waste of money. I am sorry I bought it; I  did not return it because of my silliness.,1

6645,Doesn't protect the screen as all,1
6646,Doesn't shave or trim well.,1
6647,Doesn't shave properly on Neck Area. Had more cuts and irritated skin than using razors.,1
6648,"Doesn't stay fixed on window, waste of money!",1
6649,Doesn't stay on the window always galling down.. pointless,1
6650,"doesn't stay stuck , keeps coming of , so it is useless...",1
6651,Doesn't stay up on any window. Constantly having to put it back up. Would not recommend it to anyone.,1
6652,Doesn't stick to any of the windows I've tried. Absolute rip off. I've resorted to taping brown paper across the windows.,1
6653,Doesn't stick to the window - making it basically useless,1
6654,Doesn't stick to window as suckers are a really bad design. The curtain is also too heavy so even with better suckers I doubt it would stick. Shame really,1
6655,Doesn't work,1
6656,Doesn't work as it did any more. Disappointed.,1
6657,Doesn't work. Plain and simple. Suction pads do not stick. I've had two. Both useless unless you use duck tape.,1
6658,Doesn’t stick,1

6660,Doesn’t stick to window or keep much light out. Waste of money!,1

6663,"Don't bother buying this! It's hard to get it to stick to the window, once you've managed that wait 30mins and its on the floor!!!!",1
6664,Don't buy this toothbrush if you have a small mouth. I didn't realise that the heads for Oral-B pro were so big. They do not fit in my mouth and if I try and use the toothbrush it turns to red (an indication that the pressure is too much?) I am really upset about this and feel that the description should tell potential consumers that this is the case. I feel mislead that this information was not available before I bought the product. Obviously I would not have bought this if I had been given the full facts. Hopefully my post will save others from wasting their money on a product that they can not use. I am minded to write to Braun and explain that I feel the lack of this information is misleading by omission.I have now ordered a Phillips Sonic toothbrush which I know is perfectly fine for my mouth.,1
6665,"Don't buy this, it's not good. It keeps falling, the grip of the things is terrible. One redeeming factor is that is comes with square patches of Velcro all around the edges so I might be able to salvage it by glueing some Velcro do the wall and sticking it like that. Very disappointed with this",1
6666,"Don't buy. After 2 days the charger has stopped working. Considering how much it cost, I'm disgusted. Will be returning.",1
6667,Don't stick to Windows it  keeps falling off,1
6668,Don't waste your money,1
6669,don't waste your money on this rubbish ! used it for a week ! its gone in the crap gadget draw and ive gone back to using my old philips sonicare.they have wasted time and effort on the gizmo's and done nothing to improve the toothbrush ! total rubbish !!!!!!!!!!!,1
6670,Don't waste your money. The suction cups don't stick to the window for longer than a few minutes. Terrible product.,1
6671,"Don’t bother with this buy a branded tablet, worked for around 10 minutes then nothing. Absolutely useless",1
6672,Don’t buy it doesn’t stick to the windows,1
6673,"Don’t buy it, misses so much hair, almost 0 stars.",1
6674,Don’t stick to windows well. Always falling off.,1
6675,"Dont buy in advance of your baby arriving!!! I bought a box thinking I was going to use a load of these wipes but found he gets very red after each use. Returns only permitted within a month (I purchased 2 months before due date being organised) and now cant even give them away! as friend who has a 1 yr old daughter, also experienced same problem. Dont know how as natural product and always dry straight after with cotton woll, so just on water and cotton wool now",1
6676,dont buy this toothbrush. I had to return it after 3 months due to the battery not charging.. and after receiving another toothbrush.. the same problem.. the battery doesnt charge at all.. very frustrating. dont buy!,1
6677,Dreadful - won't even cut through one piece of paper. Returned.,1
6678,"Dreadful, way to small for a iPhone 7Doesn't go to the edges, no use at all.",1
6679,Dropped my phone a few days after putting my protector on and my screen cracked underneath it!,1
6680,Dropped my phone and it smashed my actually screen and not my tempered glass,1
6681,Due to many reports of this containing a US plug and not a UK plug this product will be removed from the site until a whole inventory checked is checked. Sorry,1
6682,"Even though I love these wipes, the ones I have received are dry , they expired in February 2017 . I would buy the wipes again but not from this supplier.",1
6683,Excellent price but the screen protector is very thin and has cracked in no time.,1
6684,"Expensive but was happy with product until recently.With the most recent order the size of the box was noticeably smaller, on checking the quantity was the same but the packs were smaller, and the actual wipes have been reduced in size so often have to use more to clean.It is a deceptive, cynical move purely to increase profit. I won't be buying any more, they have lost me as a regular customer.",1
6685,EXTREMLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE ITEM. LOOKE CHEAP.,1
6686,Failed to hold charge after 1 year,1
6687,Fails to shave my face every time I use it.,1
6688,Falls down on a daily basis but works great if you can get it to stay up for more than 10 minutes.,1
6689,"Falls of every time i use it. I've tried the suggestions and it doesn't help, the suction cups are too weak to hold the weight of the blind, sad since the blind is pretty good. I've to spend extra to buy heavy duty velcro capable of holding the weight all night.",1
6690,False advertising. Call trading standards!Chemical free? Now that is impressive because the last time I checked WATER is a chemical!I'm not paying for  anything chemical free because if it's not made of chemicals it almost certainly doesn't exist.*rolls eyes*,1
6691,False economy to buy this second date device with terrible customer support.IWe purchased this as Christmas gift and worked fine for about 2 weeks. Performance image with budget tablet and ideal for price. Something happened which has made videos no longer playable and 3 calls to the customer service centre have been unable to do anything other than put me on hold until the line goes dead.I think spend a little more money and get something for for purpose that has a competent back up team.,1
6692,Fantastic product for the paltry 6 weeks it worked.  Now has stopped charging so worse than useless.  I've used oralB products for years and this is a real disappointment.  Now trying to navigate the returns process on Amazon which seems non-existent.  Could not be less satisfied with this purchase.  Avoid.,1
6693,"Far too technical, really not necessary",1
6694,Faulty product replaced with secondhand kindle,1
6695,"First foil lasted a year and fell apart, replacement foil lasted 4 months and did the same. Searched around and the isn’t unusual for the 9 series a few people have raised this problem. It’s a lot of money for something that falls apart. Waiting for Braun to respond but not too hopeful so returning to my 7 series.",1
6696,First time I wore these one snapped and I lost the crystal. Very flimsy  When they arrived one of the crystals was bent,1
6697,"Firstly I did not buy this on Amazon but thought I would warn others of it's poor performance.For the 50 years I have been shaving I have mainly used Philishaves and I like the rotary cutters which do the job well. I've also used Remingtons. Unfortunately, like anything with a rechargeable battery, my last Philishave stopped holding it's charge. Based on the reputation of German engineering, my good experiennce with my Audi car and the fact that I have a persuasive German wife, I was drawn to the Braun (pardon the rhyme). Very disappointing.Do not even consider using it dry as you will need to put an hour aside if you want a close shave. The trimmer is excellent (take care not to cut your head off) but the razor itself does not grab the hairs or cut them, whether or not you have left your beard for a day or three.Braun? Never again.",1
6698,Fitted screen a week ago and it’s cracked already. I don’t drop/chuck around my phone so no idea why.,1
6699,Flimsey and cutting blade is rubbish,1
6700,Flimsy. Doesn't cut cleanly. Doesn't fit A4 length .,1
6701,Foil broke and cut me after only about 3 weeks of use,1
6702,For me it is total waste of money as it is not convenient for me to stand in front of the mirror for an hour to shave- even after that time it's not perfect total embarrassment in the office- I am better off with an old style razor,1
6703,for the second time I received a wrong plug. the dutch socket is 3mm broader as the one i received. I bought a new one in holland for the price: 26 eufro. and so disappeared my advantage.the same thing happened to me at the purchase of philips sonicare airfloss.this will be the last time that I  will buy an electrical device at amazon co uk,1
6704,"Found this book boring, had to work hard to get through it.",1
6705,"Found this useless, just couldn't get the suckers to stick, tried everything, really angry at how much this cost me, wish I'd read some of the reviews before!",1
6706,Freezing! A waste of my money!,1
6707,Gave my baby a rash,1
6708,Gave up about 25% in. Felt it was going nowhere and doing it very slowly. Just not for me but had plenty of good reviews so I may well be in the minority,1
6709,"Gave up, really slow and boring.",1
6710,"good idea but the product is not designed perfectly. The suction packs keep falling off, not even staying on a night, an hour is already with great luck. Don't waste money on this, totally disappointing",1
6711,Good robust device certainly child proof. Purchased two of these to keep the kids amused while on holiday and travelling. This is where Amazon has it all wrong. Non of the videos are accessible outside the UK. As soon as they connected to the local WiFi the tablets went into lock down and virtually nothing worked.Amazon tech support said there was nothing they could do about it. Waste of money around sending them back when home,1
6712,good value .but not delivered,1
6713,Good wipes for sensitive skin but the packets leak in the nappy bag. Wouldn’t buy again,1
6714,Got this for my son for Christmas used it one day now the things not turning on,1
6715,Got this product in September 2017 and had it shipped to Lagos. 6 months down the line it has stopped working. It's not charging  That's awful. I am totally disappointed. Am minded to rate it no star at all.,1
6716,"Got to chapter 22 and I'm giving up on what is a really dull, slow read. Much better out there and I'm not going to waste any more time trying to appreciate this one.",1

6718,"Great black out blind when it stays up! Constantly falls down, the suction suckers don't stick onto the window, so frustrating when trying to get a young baby to sleep.",1
6719,"Great idea but majorly flawed and I have to return it for two reasons. One, it doesn’t stick to my window for more than 10 seconds and two, even if it did stick, the fabric gaps and light still comes through. Shame!",1
6720,"Great idea but the suckers didn't hold it on the window kept falling off at night, scaring the life out of me!",1
6721,Great product but I can’t help but feel completely ripped off when just a couple of weeks ago I paid amazon £129.99 for it and today I see it selling for £89.  At what price should we expect to receive value for money?,1
6722,Great product but really annoyed Amazon reduced the price by £40 a week after I bought it!,1
6723,"Great tablet from santa. Daughter(6) was overjoyed with it, till it completely destroyed her childhood.After setting it up with full setting for her age, she started playing with it. After a couple of days she asks about a pop-up on one of her games.(my dentist game). “Why does that man have his willy in a girls bum” . Shocked and horrified does not even describe how we felt.Apparently if a certain app is downloaded(word cookies)  it allows adult content to pop-up in any app or video within the tablet. Surely the restrictions should be a lot more stringent on a tablet designed specifically for children.Thank you amazon for the destroying my 6 year olds childhood.A livid parent.",1
6724,"had for a few months now the battery wont charge properly , not worth it but good when works",1
6725,Had it a little over 4 months and the on/off switch has broken. There doesn't appear to be any way of contacting the seller or returning it via Amazon.,1
6726,"Had it three months and it is now totally unresponsive.Tried charging all night and pressing buttons for 20 seconds etc, but nothing at all.It's hardly even ever been used.",1
6727,Had one of these previously and it was fine but this one the suckers were useless.  Only used it for the first time today and too late to return it.  Had to use masking tape to stick it up :-(,1
6728,"Had product for two months, no longer fully charges, would not buy again",1
6729,Had replaced twice now as don’t charge well or black screen,1
6730,Had Sonic for years and thought I would give this a try as I got it on a special amazon deal. However it falls short in every way. Maybe because I used Sonic I may have been spoilt for quality of cleaning it offers compared to this.,1
6731,Had this 3 months now. It won't recharge. Absolute rubbish.,1
6732,Had this around a year an despite it being slightly difficult my daughter loved it now all of a sudden it won’t load any apps an despite calling amazon they have now said it’s a error they don’t know how to fix so it’s useless! Not impressed at all,1
6733,"Had this delivered March 31st. It was great for a couple of months then all the apps started to disappear and said ""no content ask your parents about adding some apps"" I'd turn it off and back on again and the apps would come back a few times but now they don't come back at all! Also the WiFi keeps knocking off so I'm constantly putting the WiFi password in! My daughter hasn't used it in about 4 weeks because she's fed up of it",1
6734,Had to pay postage costs for delivery and return.  I too didn't check the measurement but still feel the description and photograph are misleading.,1
6735,Had to return as not really worth the money and not fit for purpose.,1
6736,hard going rubbish,1
6737,Hard to get the cut in the right place if your page is longer than the ruler suppose in the back board. Doesn't make the cut where I expect and doesn't cut all the way through card,1

6740,Hate it !The blind always fall I'm forever sticking it ok the window throughout the night .. So annoying and not worth the money and headache,1
6741,Hated this audio version as Alexa's tone of voice was totally inappropriate - flat and boring with no expression.,1
6742,"Have just read Behind Her Eyes and loved it. This pales by comparison. I thought it started slow and ploughed through it, but I don't think my persistence was rewarded. The eclipse detail bored me and I didn't feel much sympathy for the characters. Would not recommend this, sorry.",1
6743,Have now had two of these toothbrushes and unfortunately had to send both back with different fanlts,1
6744,Have owned the toothbrush for under 16 months at it no longer works. Very disappointed!,1
6745,"Having got this on sale, I was extremely excited at the prospect of getting my such a bargain.To say I am disappointed, is an understatement. For Braun to supply such a bad product is disgraceful. This ""shaver"" just really doesn't work. I'd have ton be sat there for up to an hour to actually get a good shave..To top it off, it was a present and now I can't return.",1
6746,"Having used Braun for years I thought On the train, see you soon xxx was time for a new one. This is very disappointing thought. Even after shaving with the trimmer first it struggles to give me a clean shave, leaving bits. It take ages to cut, at least 4 times longer than my old shaver.And the 'wet shave' thing is a gimmick. It can't cope with dry stubble let alone soft wet stubble.This is cheap compared to my old shaver. You get what you pay for I guess.",1
6747,"Having used budget rotary shavers from Argos all my life, I thought I would treat myself to one of the professional models; I did my research, and the Braun Series 3 were rated highly everywhere I looked online. I'd never owned a foil, but when this one came on a 50% sale I took the plunge... and it's perhaps the worst disappointment I've ever had with regards to electrical goods.Firstly the manual (as most are these days) is brief to the point of almost uselessness, which is a particular bugbear as the cleaning mechanism for the heads isn't explained well at all. Hair gets trapped and compacted beneath the foil, and tapping the head doesn't shake it out. I ended up googling to try and find a more helpful description, but even Braun's own webpage isn't much use; from what I can gather I need to run it under water, then let it dry, and then tap it out? But this just gunks all the hairs together and leaves it even more blocked. The manual does warn you not to put a brush into the head, like a normal shaver.... so how exactly do you clear it? I've yet to find a consistent way.Secondly, the physical design is just poor; the trimmer doesn't sit flush, but protrudes beyond the shell and is situated right where your fingers would often be placed. They aren't sharp enough to break skin, but it's an unpleasant stabbing sensation all the same.Thirdly, battery charge seems to be pathetic; even charging for 10 hours only gives enough for maybe 30 minutes of shaving, as soon as the unit is powered up the lights are down to almost empty. Of 3 charge lights, I've never seen it rise above two, and as soon as it's turned on, the second vanishes and the bottom begins to flash... Whether it's a faulty model or not, I'm not sure. You cannot however run it from the mains, at least in my experience. It's battery or nothing. But all of this might be forgiven if it could shave like a demon......but doesn't shave at all. I'm not particularly thick haired, but the 3040 just doesn't grasp my stubble. People reporting 1 hour shave times aren't joking, I'd need to do the same to have any sort of chance at clean chops. It's honestly humiliated by my £10 rotary shaver from Argos; it's possibly the case that because I can at least clean that correctly, the 3040 is appearing worse than it really is, but as fas as I can tell, only the central foil is a cutting surface, so even if it were immaculate I don't think it's ever going to be fast...Where are all the outstanding reviews coming from though? Some people are clearly delighted with their shaver; I wish I knew why. Mine was absolutely awful.",1
6748,"Having used these wipes for over 4 years with my babies, I was so disappointed to find the latest batch I bought in July 2016 are now too small to be of any practical use! The pack size is noticeably slimmer, but ever worse, the actual wipes are now too small! They used to be an ample size, covering your hand; now it is dificult to clean without getting your hand covered in poo! I notice the price is still the same, so in effect you are getting less for your money! I actually wouldn't have minded paying more for keeping the same size wipe. As it is, they are now too small to be practical, so they've lost a customer.",1
6749,"Hi i got this as a gift and i had such high hopes for this product,  i really want a good shaving product and use it infront of my gf every single day but with this product all you get is the pain and non of the hair removal.i fully charged it 3 times and used it 3 times and boy did i want to record a video of this thing absolutely doing nothing but vibrating...i was originally trying to shave my face and 0.000000001 mm out of the regular short 7-day facial hair got trimmed.So naturally i decided to try on my chest, after 10 minutes of FORCEFULLY PUSHING IT HAAAAAAAAAAAARD and almost in a stabbing way it could reach to get like 5 hairs, i wish i could record how unaffected and inefficient this product is, i felt like setting my beard on fire would be a more pleasing experience then going over with this vibrator 75 times over the same area to see 3% hair removal.3 hours charge, 30 min of shaving, £48 and 3% hairs gone, actually make it £50 since you wont be ever able to charge this as it comes with a NON UK power charger, saw nothing about this and got ourselves a europe,uk tourist charger adapter just to charge it and find out its just as bad as semi charged but vibrates louder (not more)not joking i look exactly the same except if you count the particles in the sink i definatly lost a hair or two. also the manual it came with is wrong product and show how to operate a different model. not sure if this helps future customers but please be aware. Amazon is amazing but i dont know if there is any consumer support if a prodect does not live up to its name, obviously this is on Braun but it seems as to  much effort so starting to save up money for maybe a 100£ shaver and hope for the best again...problem is that she read all the good reviews and did research so i feel really bad over not using this, to the point i almost think my product is broken or malfunction however i literally cannot use the shaver for shaving so it sits on a shelf doing nothing now and i feel so bad over this.",1
6750,"Hi There, my product has developed a fault, it stopped charging a while back with the light flashing. It doesn't get through one shave cycle and cuts out. It's hardly been used. Are you able to help with a replacement or check if i send it back. Thanks.",1
6751,Holder snapped in half first time I used it. I mounted the holder to my air vent and got a nice tight fit. All good on that front. I then stuck my phone in to see how well it holds.. not bad at all. I then went to take my phone out of the holder and the holder snapped off from the mounting bracket. It was cheap. You get what you pay for I suppose.,1
6752,Holds phone ok but broke very easily. Have contacted seller for replacement.,1
6753,Honestly?  It will keep me awake at night wondering how they made the suction caps quite so bad on these.  Can't comment on the black out effect of the blinds as I only got to the infuriating stage of trying to get the suction caps to stay on. They didn't.  I gave up. Really awful.,1
6754,Hopeless the suction cups don't work even after following instructions carefully and ensuring window was cleaned. Keeps falling down so item pretty useless. Please can I return?,1
6755,Hopelessly frustrating product. The pads keep falling off and it is tough to shape it to the window meaning a bit of light is always going to creep through. Also from the outside it makes your house look very ugly.,1
6756,Horrible !! It doesn't want to stick to the window and if it does it falls off after few minutes . All the suctions are bend and very hard to even try to stick it on !!!,1
6757,"Horrible shaver cant reach certain hairs and your stuck with little bit of unshaven areas looking like an idiot, I have used £20 electric shaver before it broke and it was WAY better this really sucks.",1
6758,Horrible things the suckers don't hold for a full night so constantly putting it back.,1
6759,Horribly noisy to use and not a patch on my original Oral B electric toothbrush. Wasn't too impressed with my Philips diamond head sonic brush so when it packed up a few days ago I was looking forward to getting a really decent electric toothbrush again. This is definitely not it.,1
6760,How do I turn off the flashing blue light when it's charging? I tried turning off the charger but the blue light won't go away. It is simply ridiculous as there is no way to turn off the blue light. I brush my teeth before bed and it takes 40 minutes to charge up the amount of power I used for that one brushing session. The light is just so maddening as I have to put it in my college dorm room! Is there a solution?,1
6761,How is this for an iPhone 6S when the protector does not fit? To small.,1
6762,Hugely disappointed don't ever stay up!,1
6763,Hurts a lot enough said,1
6764,I ACTUALLY ORDERED THIS SHAVER AFTER READING THE REVIEWS AND THE GOOD PRICE OF £39.99 then recieved the confirmaton stating £40 odd pounds maybe only 3-4 £ but not right so i cancelled PITY!,1
6765,"I already have a gro black out and it is excellent. I ordered another for the youngest child's room and like other reviewers, I can't get it to stick to the window. There must be a problem or defective suckers as I tried for ages and it still wouldn't stick.",1
6766,I already have a pink one which I bought 2 years ago and it's fantastic! We wouldn't be without it on holiday as well!I ordered this one for my sons bedroom and it 4 times out of 5 you stick it in the window and it peels off....it's so frustrating,1
6767,I am afraid I find having no Google apps as a big disappointment and made my tablet useless.,1
6768,I am exceedingly disappointed with this shaver. I thought that a Braun would be a good make. The shaver frequently falls apart and putting it together again is extremely tedious. I wish to return it a very  unsatisfactory.Peter Laidlaw,1
6769,"I am gobsmacked at this toothbrush. It's so aggressive. Is it supposed to sound so loud and feel so mechanical? It is uncomfortable to use and the vibration is extremely excessive. Having used a skincare previously, the difference is night and day. I am wondering if it is faulty or if this is the norm?",1
6770,"i am kinda bold, now i am less kinda bold",1
6771,"I am really disappointed with this product.  The battery life is nowhere near what the booklet says (up to 10 days)!!!. I have to charge it every day, sometimes the light shows 3 bars but it suddenly stops working in the middle of the brush, and I have to keep charging it every day. I replaced the fist one as I thought there is a problem with the battery, but unfortunately,​ the second one is the same.",1
6772,"I am really not happy with the product. I charged it overnight and after brushing for 4 times, the battery died. I fee like i paid for nothing. I wud rather buy 2 pound volgate electronic brush which last me a month of battery power. I did not get any refund address slip either so i do not know where to refund it? So please tel me the address!",1
6773,"I am reluctant to draw this conclusion but as the rest of the reviews state, when you see the packaging it's only then it will specify 'photo trimmer' and that it is good at, as a general use guillotine it's tiers below a ruler and a scalpel blade. If I could go again I would spend a couple of extra pounds and buy a larger A4 guillotine without hesitation.",1
6774,"I am returning this item. The suction pads don't even work properly. When they do work, they stay on the window for about 2 minutes, which results in disturbing my little boy.",1
6775,I am sorry but I cannot understand why this novel has reached the dizzy heights of the top ten books. I was glad when I finished it as I am like a dog with a bone and was loathe to give up waiting for the spectacular ending. Even that was a disappointment.  I was glad to get on to another book where I didn't have to wait until I was a 5th. of the story in before I got any action. I am sorry to say that I have read many better books than this all of which deserved more praise than this one.,1
6776,"I am very dissatisfied with this product. Just 6 months after purchase it is unusable because the battery will no longer hold its charge. A friend has told me that this may be because I left it on charge for too long. However, this practice is encouraged by the system of lights to show how much the product has charged. It was almost impossible to see how many lights were on, and therefore how much the product may have been charged. There is no warning with the product to say that it should not be put on charge for more than a certain time",1
6777,I asked if kids unlimited would work before i bought i was told it would work.It didnt work I returned it,1
6778,"I bought 2 of these for my children as I assumed that they would be the best children's tablets. They might be, however I couldn't get YouTube for kids which they love. When looking into it a bit more, it transpired that Google play store is not installed on this tablet. This is a MAJOR PROBLEM.After googling this problem, I have been able to download the apk for play store and downloaded YouTube Kids, but then subsequently can't add it to their child profile.Although the tablets come with a nice case, Amazon don't include a screen protector. You would think with all the money Amazon save by not paying uk tax, they would be able to provide a screen protector.If you want a useless kids tablet without access to all the Android apps, this one is a good choice",1
6779,I bought one of these for one of my sons. It managed 2 months of light use before dying completely.,1
6780,I bought these for my husbands work phone and they arrived like they'd been run over and were unfit for use.,1
6781,"I bought these previous previously from Amazon and they were great, no chemical smell, fantastic on my boys bum. With this order, the package seemed slightly different and smelt different (chemically)I thought that maybe they had changed the ingredients and that it was a fruit extract that didn't agree with my son. (I also got this 12 pack at an extremely reasonable price, working out at around £1 per pack)I was going to stop using them and find a different type of wipes, but thought I would try it one last time. This current pack, that I have, has no chemical smell and the packaging is alike to the first that I received.I am very angry with this, and am wondering where Amazon have gotten these fake products from!!!I have managed to get the real ones at £1.50 per pack, at the cheapest, any cheaper than this and I would be wary!!!",1
6782,"I bought this device for my little son. He loves it, although it became faulty. Reported this to Amazon who sent a second hand device and refused to send a new device as replacement. Amazon was very forceful with the second device and refused to help. Shameful of Amazon. I am now considering buying a Samsung tablet which from past experiences have great costumer support and understanding. I have cancelled my Prime membership since.",1
6783,"I bought this for my daughter a while ago. On the positive side it's a decent enough screen for watching videos. Som of the content it comes with is decent although the vast majority is junk I don't really want her to watch.Battery life is low - you'll need a long USB cable and somewhere to connect it on long car or plane journeys, although it's a good way of restricting its usage, other than the fact you'll then have to charge it.The worst aspect, however, is you don't get to control what your kids watch; Amazon does. While it is possible to add your own media files to the device (which is what you purchased the thing for in the first place) and you can download applications to play them, you can't make those applications visible to kids on their accounts. So you have to give them a ""normal"" account, which defeats the purpose of the kids account.On each update of the OS (which you can't disable) they restrict it further. Next time round I'd buy a proper tablet with stock Android and lock it down myself.",1
6784,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday.I looked for a  ""good brand"",{ as i thought}.The price wasn't cheap,but wasn' t on the high price bracket.Obviously,as i am female,i thought it would be perfect for him.However,i was very wrong.It is very poor .He cannot get a close shave at all.I am very disappointed,because it was a gift.Braun is supposed to be a top brand.This is not a top product.Not everyone has hundreds of pounds to spend on such items,but ,i would have expected better quality.NOT HAPPY",1
6785,I bought this for my three year old when she went into a different bedroom and the street lights kept her awake a friend said to get this but after receiving it and trying (and failing miserable myself to put up)  it kept falling down some of the suckers were broke when it was puckered it let in light from the gaps absolute waste of money !!!,1
6786,I bought this hoping to have a quick option when I couldn't be bothered with a wet shave. I'm new to electric shaving and have found this to be absolutely useless!! It leaves me with stubble that looks like 2 days growth and misses bits completely. Buy with caution!,1
6787,I bought this in June 2015 (have only had it for 4 months!) It worked great when it did but now it has stopped working and doesn't charge.  The light was constantly flashing red.  There doesn't seem to be a returns policy for this so don't know what to do! There aren't any contact details available either.  Please can someone let me know whether you've had the same problems and what you did?,1
6788,I bought this in June 2015. It's April 2017 and the battery has stopped working. If I'd have known I wouldn't have bought such an expensive toothbrush. I'm going to buy the least expensive one from now on.,1
6789,I bought this in November 2016 and it just packed up overnight. A complete waste of money. Poor buy from a reputable company. I expected better quality.,1
6790,"I bought this on Amazon Prime day and have to wonder if the reduction in price was due to faulty stock?! The battery has been terrible! After one month the battery started showing problems and now it needs constant charging to make it useable. A real disappointment! Even though it was reduced to £55, I would still expect it to last longer than five months.",1
6791,I bought this product and it stopped working after 6 months.  Not very happy about it as it was expensive and expected a better product.,1
6792,"I bought this product and placed on my phone, within 3 days, the protector had shattered. Will buy from elsewhere next time.",1
6793,I bought this product due to its environmental properties and used it happily for 6 months. I have just opened the first pack of 2 multi boxes I bought and feel cheated. These are A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCT!!  As soon as I felt them I noticed the difference - before they were soft and natural but now they feel like a cheap pair of old nylon curtains. In addition they are NO LONGER BIODEGRADABLE!!!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU  CARE ABOUT CLEANING YOUR BABY ADEQUATELY OR THE ENVIRONMENT. It fails dismally on both counts. I am now left with hundreds of useless wipes.,1
6794,I bought this razor for my dad last year in May  and it has never worked properly he has had a stroke and so has to be shaved by carers and family and its never given a good shave so I have given up and purchased another razor as its useless.  Is there anyway that I can return it as I would of thought it would be guaranteed for at least one year.  Everyone who has tried it said it did not shave him properly and it was disappointing as the one he had previously was very good made by Braun but so much better.,1
6795,"I bought this table for my Little one but whenever i tried to download any games its says there is an error with amazon download please retry again later. I tried and tried again and again. same problem.. I will keep this tablet one more week to check again, If still is a problem I will return it.",1
6796,"I bought this to replace a cheap travel shaver I have (remington R91) , I was expecting it to be a jump up in performance, for me this has been the most useless shaver I have ever used. After spending 15 minutes trying to shave with it on 3 different occasions I eventually returned to the cheap travel shaver to remove the large amount of hair that this simply would not cut, each time the old shaver dealt with it in 2 minutes and left no stubble or hairEverything else about it is fine but for me it simply does not do what I need, which is to shave faster than when I wet shave and remove all the stubble and hair. Sticking with the old travel one for when I cannot be bothered to wet shave, I would not recommend this productReturned for refund",1
6797,i bought this to replace my braun shaver series 3 340s ! i’ve gotta say it’s awful ! even with the same blade it’s nowhere near as close a shave ! also the on and off button is awful and doesn’t seem to work every time ! very disappointed,1
6798,I bought this to take on holiday. I read a lot. This book was dull on every level. I was waiting for the big twist. That didn't happen. The characters are shallow. The editor should have cut the content by 50%. Do yourself a favour and choose something else!,1
6799,"I bought this trimmer despite the poor reviews, the trimmer struggled with any more than one sheet of paper and ragged up the edges of the paper, it was also much smaller than i needed, it only fits A4 paper in the landscape position, went out and bought a much better one at aldi.",1
6800,"I bought this two months ago. It was brilliant to start with but after only two months it stopped working properly. My brush will only work in sensitive mode, even if there’s no pressure at all, so it’s very hard to get a proper clean. The timer supplied with the brush never worked. Hopefully they’ll repair or replace it, but really, for such a well known brand, it’s very poor. I’ve had two oral-b brushes previously and the battery life was extremely poor on both. I’m not sure I’d buy this brand again.",1
6801,"I bought this while back and it eventually stopped working, it had one year guarantee so i decided to send it on the given address, its been nearly 6 months i still havn't heard back from them and neither has the tooth brush returned back to me",1
6802,I bought two and they were far too big and wouldn't stick properly. Returned them both and seller on refunded me for one. Don't recommend,1
6803,"I bought two boxes of these in the prime sale and both I had to return because the packets inside the box were leaking water. I guess it was a bad batch because I've never had this issue before and I have been using water wipes for about a year. I've noticed that some posters have mentioned the quality of these is going down so perhaps that's what is happening here, but after the hassle of having t return two packets I am now buying the individual packets in my local boots where I can check the quality. I'd be curious to see if  any other posters had issues with these.I'm generally a big fan of the water wipes as I don't like the idea of putting chemicals on my babies skin but I'm too lazy to prepare cotton wool and water.",1
6804,"I brought this for uni to help cutting with labels, pictures etc for my sketchbook work by it was awful! It can't even cut straight! It always leaves a curve edge and it's not a clean cut either, it damages the paper and makes the edges look rough.Would not recommend, you're better off investing more money for a better product",1
6805,"i brought this toothbrush and after just 4 months the battery kept packing in.  It was well looked after, not overcharged once, hardly used as we have 4 others and this was really purchased by mistake. . Amazon will only accept it back within 30 days., so I emailed Braun.  Braun hasn't even replied to my email. So I have to find the time to phone them. Who has the time these days to complain. I will pursue the matter when I get time but my husbands already jumped ship after 15 years with Braun to Philips. He's being using it for a month and his teeth look amazing. Philips sonic is definitely a better clean than Braun, but I just don't like the sensation on the teeth with the philips. I read on the Braun website that another customer who purchased from amazon had the same problem.. So Be careful., Amazon stock could be old., giving low durability on the Battery. They always go after 2-3 years and unlike before can't be replaced..",1
6806,"I can only suppose all the positive reviews for this item didn't come from people who were used to wet shaving. I've been trying to use this shaver for a month hoping I'd learn the right technique or something, but I've come to the conclusion that it couldn't cut through a silk worms crap.",1
6807,"I can see why it was reduced from 99 to £47.00, I bought this for my 15 year old son as he hates shaving.It has to have an adaptor to charge it & it certainly doesn't do anything it says it will. If you have strong hair you can barely tell you have shaved. You can have a wet or dry shave but it really doesn't make a difference to the quality as both are as useless as the other.Recommendation: absolutely not",1
6808,I can't believe how angry I am after trying to fit this product.  None of the Sixers stick and I have ended up doing a Hodge job with electric tape until I can summon the energy to do something else with it before I put it in the bin.  Do not buy!,1
6809,"I cannot add simple movies like Charlie and Chocolate Factory, the Minions, or Moana to my child's profile! Amazon says it is not compatible with the child's profile settings. I can use it on my own profile. I have tried adding a number of movies and apps to see if any of them are compatible but none are showing up within my child's profile. I have created a TEST profile making child 18 and the APPS AND MOVIES work? I then did third profile making child 8 years old, still unable to view APPS or movies. Minions is rated U on Amazon but this is still not showing up on the 8 year old profile. This is very frustrating and hope Amazon get back to in the swiftly to resolve otherwise both tablets I have purchased are going back.",1
6810,I cannot get on with this tablet at all.The interface is horribly clunky and very unresponsive. We are forever having to reboot it.The kids year subscription content is poor and very American.No youtube kids.An botched android interface that feels like android 4No google play storeI wish wed gone stock android tablet with kids case.,1
6811,"I cannot in good conscious recommend this product - it has a nickel battery that can take up to 27 hours to charge! If you don't discharge and charge it properly, you will, like me, kill the battery and it will be completely useless! This means getting a backup toothbrush to use while it charges for over a day!Spend the extra £10 (offer prices, they are always on offer) and go the the lithium one, the 9000 series - its just a shame about the 9000's app!",1
6812,I could not get lnto the Story,1
6813,"I could shave with this for hours....that's because it refuses to cut hair. Every time I've tried to use this to shave I've cut myself multiple times and all of my hair is still firmly attached to my face, until eventually I give up and use a safety razor. I strongly recommend people to stay away",1
6814,I couldn't get into this gave up after a couple of chapters,1
6815,I currently have a dry only shaver and thought I would try a wet and dry shaver for more comfort.The shaving performance of this model is awful. Took almost 30 mins to shave and even then had to finish the shave with another shaver. Do not recommend this product.,1
6816,"I decided to update my shaver after 12 years.......I thought this would be great and that I would be able to say goodbye to my old shaver. No. This ""shaver"" takes ages to remove any hair. I have found myself going back to my old shaver to finish the shave off.Very disappointing!",1
6817,I did not receive my travel case!,1
6818,"I didn't care for this book and was disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews.  I thought the self-torment was ridiculous and didn't really get why it played such a huge part in the book.  Also, you need a better editor.  Some of the sentences did not make any sense at all.",1
6819,I didn't like this book at all.  Life it too short to read books you don't like.  I just couldn't get into this book.,1
6820,I didnt like it my baby had it worse when I use this product.,1
6821,"I do not believe these are genuine water wipes they are different to the ones you buy in the shops, they are not as wet as the proper water wipes and so you have to use twice as many wipes.  I would not recommend, buy proper water wipes from a more reputable supplier.",1
6822,"I don't even have a thick beard and it missed so many hairs. Where it did work, it worked okay, but I had to go over my whole face with my old razor so I didn't go out looking like I had shaved with my eyes closed.",1
6823,I don't get the products. I get different things that I oreder!,1
6824,"I don't know what excites the Sunday Times, obviously this book did. It's slow, tedious and not gripping at all.",1
6825,"I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but this was awful. Agonisingly slow, by the 60th page I was flicking through just to get it over with. The characters are incredibly dull, unrelateable and to be frank I couldn't have cared whether the author killed them all off. There are plenty of books with intelligent plot, twists and interesting characters - this isn't one of them. I recommend you save your money for one of those books.",1
6826,I don't understand this shiver. Does nothing,1
6827,"I find this to be a really poor product.Firstly, how can they get away with calling them chemical free? Water is a chemical, hydrogen and oxygen are both chemicals!* The wipes towards the bottom of the pack are far too wet. You have to wring them out before using.* I find that the serrated seals at the edge of the pack are quite sharp. I no longer put the pack on the changing table as I'm worried that baby will get scratched by these sharp edges.* It's really difficult to pull out one wipe at a time. You usually pull out 2-3 wipes at each try.Go with the cheaper alternatives, the extra money for these wipes is really not worth it.",1
6828,I found it did not shave well at all compared to a wet shave.,1
6829,"I found it very difficult to get all the suckers to stick, despite following all the tips.  And if you want to allow light in when it is not nap time, once you unstick it, it is evener harder to stick back down.  Not suitable as a temporary blind, only if you want to keep it up permanently.",1
6830,I found the wipes extremely wet and caused my son to have extremely bad nappy rash!Waste of money to be honest!,1
6831,"I found them a pain to use as when you fold it in half the fabric slides on itself so your fingers slip, this is because they are made of polyester, a synthetic fibre that can take 200 years to degrade, not what i would expect from such a ""pure"" product and not so good for the future generations they are being used on. I switched to cloth wipes and you can fold and fold again and therefore you get better economy and they will degrade easier so clearer on my conscience.These wipes are a bit of a con- they are all about 'purity' and equate them to cotton wool and water-well then you may as well use cotton wool and water!",1
6832,"I found this book  particularly un gripping ,long drawn out and in original  same old story and. One dimensional characters",1
6833,"I found this book incredibly dull. It is very slow until maybe the last third, when it picks up but also becomes preposterous. There are basic errors throughout - for example, Laura drops Beth's purse in shock at what she sees but a couple of pages later she is shocked to find that she is still holding it; not as shocked as I was! -  which in a better story might not have mattered so much but which became an increasing annoyance in this one.  The terrible event in Zanzibar, which is referred to regularly, turned out to be a complete non-event, and that is fairly typical of the melodramatic nature of much of the book. I found it incredibly disappointing.",1
6834,"I gave this device to my 7-year-old and the first book it recommends to my kid is ”The Night Dad Went to Jail”. I can appreciate that the constant fear of getting killed by police and/or thrown to prison is quintessential part of American Way of Life, but it’s not really something that people can expect to happen on this side of Atlantic.",1
6835,I generally shave every 3rd day and my stubble is very hard.After about 20 mins of a lot of noise and trying hard I am left with a patchy shave. Especially around the neck.If you were to use it daily it would cope slightly betterTo summarize - wet shaving is quicker hurts less and closer. My first and ONLY electric shaver,1
6836,I got  this book because of the ratings & reviews. This book did very little for me and  I felt it took far too long to get to the storyline therefore I gave up although I persevered up until chapter 22. A dissapointing read.,1
6837,I guess the toothbrush is amazing but I will never find out as even you order it on Amazon UK you don't get a UK charger. You would have to buy am adapter to be able to charge it in the UK. Really disappointing.,1
6838,"I had a free copy from Netgalley.  I can read mostvp books, even genre I don't normally read. Not this one. Failed to grip, not interesting and didn't get past chapter 1",1
6839,I had one of these about 3 years ago and it was fantastic but this one couldn't be any worse! The suckers simply won't stick! No matter what I have tried they just don't do their job. Very disappointed.,1
6840,"I had purchased this toothbrush as a treat for myself. The first couple of weeks when I began using the toothbrush were great. The toothbrush had a timer and a screen to indicate which side of the mouth to brush as well as a pressure sensor to indicate if too much pressure was applied to the teeth when brushing. The first charge lasted around 10 days. On the second charge, the toothbrush lasted a minute before stopping and indicating that it needed to be charged again which I left overnight. The toothbrush would still not work. I have now had to resort to using a manual toothbrush and this experience has completely put me off using an electric toothbrush.",1
6841,I have an Iphone 6S and the protective sheet does not include the correct holes for the camera etc,1
6842,I have been using them since my son was born however they have now been changed and the wipes are rough feels more like a paper than a wipe .. not the same quality they had before . Very disappointing,1
6843,"I have been using these wipes and these wipes only for 9 months now. The wipes themselves are great, however I have just had my usual delivery and the pack size is noticeably smaller when compared to my last delivery. As the pack still contains 60 wipes the wipes must be smaller, therefore you need more. The price is still the same though, so you're effectively getting less for your money.",1
6844,"I have been using these wipes for the last 3 years because I suffer from eczema and they are the only wipes I can use without my skin flaring up but sadly I won't be buying them anymore, they are simply too expensive. Since the 15 pack has disappeared from sale and the packets have reduced to 60 wipes I have been forced to revert to taking damp flannels out with me. Such a shame because I used to rave about these wipes.",1
6845,"I have bought solely these wipes from birth for my daughter who is one year old.  I am appauled at the recent poor quality, reduced quantity and price hike.  Like the rest of the reviewers for this item, I too am going to buy Pampers from now on.  This company have made a grave mistake down-grading the quality, etc. and I wonder if they'll regret it?",1
6846,"I have cleaned my window and tried many times to secure the product but some of the suckers just do not work. Very frustrating, product will be returned.",1
6847,"I have given a 1 star not for the quality of the product but for the customer service at Amazon. The product does not hav a hole for the forward facing camera lens despite showing one on the advertising. I contacted amazon to explain the problem and that I would like a screen saver with an hole. The operator just kept repeating that he would give a refund, give a refund, give a refund like a robotic moron. I did not want a refund I wanted a cover with a hole, he said I would have to order again ? How do I know the next one will have an hole because it shows on advertising , so did last one, we will give a refund, aaaaaagggghh , is it now amazon policy to employ morons? Anyway if you order one one of these it's a good product but has no hole for the selfie lens .",1
6848,I have given this product a low rating for the following reason-you can not recharge this product in the UK. You need to buy a suitableadapter in order to Charge it. Braun or Amazon should make this clear at the point of sale!!!!!! Al Jones,1
6849,"I have had on approximately a month, dropped my phone today and I'm not faced with a completely shattered screen, I quite honestly could cry. Now facing a £60 repair cost. Wouldn't recommend. The protector itself isn't cracked at all but my screen is in 100's of peices",1
6850,"I have had this for about 4 months now and although the toothbrush is excellent the stated 10 day charge time is a joke, I only get 6 days after a full 24 hour charge, i am the sole user brushing twice a day ! Very disappointed",1
6851,"I have had this razor for six months (bought through my girlfriends account, hence the name here). In that time it has consistently failed to provide anything resembling a close shave. You have to shave the same parts of your face over and over several times to get any kind of passable result, and even then I look like I have a days stubble. It doesn't run with the contours of the face well, so spots are easily missed and you cannot shave under your nose at all. The little pop out trimmer meant to resolve this last issue is terrible, somehow managing to irritate the skin while failing to remove any hair.The only positive thing I can say is that the battery life is good, it runs for a long time before needing charging. However overall this shaver has been a complete disappointment and I will be looking elsewhere for a replacement.",1
6852,I have had this shaver about 6 weeks.My previous 2 shavers were rotary models from Remington and Philips - they both gave a much closer shave than this Braun. For my next shaver I will go back to a rotary model.,1
6853,"I have had this shaver now for just over a month, i bought it solely on the excellent reviews it got. However I'm afraid that I have found this shaver to be the WORST shaver I have ever had!  I have just spent about 20 minutes reassembling the blades back into the holder as they fell out whilst cleaning it and not for the first time!!  Also there is no way that this shaver can cope with more than one - two days growth, I tried it after i had been away for a long weekend without being able to have a shave [forgot to take the shaver with me] and it literally almost RIPPED the hairs out!!  I have tried it wet to see if that would make any difference, but it didn't.  I wish I had sent it back when I had the chance instead of persevering with it.So from my personal point of view there is NO WAY I would recommend this shaver!!",1
6854,I have had this toothbrush a month used it twice a day on the recommended 2 minute setting its charge lasts 15 seconds now,1
6855,"I have happily been paying a premium for the DermaH20 WaterWipes as they HAVE been brilliant. That is, of course, until the latest batch I bought. Absolutely dreadful !! Its a disgrace that the product has been changed so much but no mention of it in the product description. I feel betrayed by a brand I came to trust. All I can say is they've lost a customer. Obviously a struggling company who decided they needed to save a few pennies, but decided it better to deceive their existing customers. Get real, as if we were ever going to fall for that more than once. Remember this little phrase ""It's easier to keep a client than find a new one.""",1
6856,"I have just read the recent reviews, as I just about to order this but I stoppedCannot blame on amazon, as I was using this since my baby was born, it was absolutely amazing product in the very beginning, (my son was born in Jan this year). I was always buy this from Bo**s, but they always out of stock.One day, I realised the packaging became smaller, and the actual wipes are smaller as well. And they are not as soft as before and contain much less water, which means they are much drier then before. Ended up same as other baby wipes brand, even the te**o value one which I am using now lol, does the same job, no redness, but 5 times cheaper.",1
6857,"I have just received the item and the shaver seems to be working properly and i'm sure it will be a great shaver. I have just tried to charge it up before giving it a go and the connection into the shaver is very loose. It does charge but it just falls out when i try to plug it in, like it isn't the correct connection for the shaver. I don't know if it's suppose to be loose like that but i assume it isn't. I'm just hoping to get a reply from this so there can be a replacement sent to me or if i have to send it back to be swapped.I'd usually contact the seller via message but I don't seem to have the option so I've had to communicate through this. I fully intend to change the 1 star if it can be resolved. Thanks for any help.",1
6858,"I have just returned this product for a refund.  Water wipes have changed so dramatically that in my opinion they are as good as the cheapest on the market.I have been buying Water Wipes for nearly a year now, since my baby was born.  I have raved about them, given them as presents to new mums and generally encouraged my friends to buy them.  They were my number one new baby product.  However, with out any warning other than other customer feedback they changed the fabric they are made from making them feel and work completely differently to the the amazing product they were.  The biodegradable is also gone from the packaging.Don't waste your money DO NOT BUY THESE!If the manifacturer changed them back to what they use to be than I will rewrite my review and continue buying them.Amazon do let the seller know!",1
6859,"I have no way of contacting this seller - so here's the bottom line. I bought  this product of over a year now and it's great.  I've moved and needed to buy some online.  What I got from you is a substandard product.  I guess you've been let down by your supplier, but all 3 packets of wipes I've opened so far are dryer than I am used to and when you pull a wipe out, another one does not follow - a pain when your cleaning up a lot of poo!",1
6860,I have ordered these wipes roughly 3 times. First time the wipes were excellent and great value for money (£17-£19). Second time I felt the wipes were quite dry and cost me £24*. Third time I have to put water on them to even use them as they are dry and harsh on a baby's skin. I am not impressed as I was happy to pay double the price for these wipes compared to johnsons on the basis they were great quality.,1
6861,"I have received the product as described, however after usung the wipes for 4 weeks I have notices that my fingerstips are extremely dry (like when you use bleach or a very aggressive product on your skin) my husband has git the same on his so I am now really worried how ‘delicate’ these wipes could be on a newborn bum... weirdly the LO seems fine but... I am really worried ?! Has anyone experienced something similar? be really careful, I won’t use these anymore",1
6862,"I have to say this is one of the most boring books I have read. I’m on page 135 and have decided to give up! Life’s too short! Usually I like to find out who did what but I’m bored with this. Don’t care about the characters. They haven’t grabbed my attention, I don’t feel anything for them so I’m not fussed to find out what happened.",1
6863,"I have used OralB/Braun electric toothbrushes for years and have never had any problems. Bought this one as my old one didn't have any battery life left - I essentially needed to charge it every day. Turns out this new model is no better: battery life lasts for 2, maximum 3 uses. All that Bluetooth connectivity is completely unnecessary in my opinion and I'd rather do without it if the impact on battery life is so severe. It's going back.",1
6864,"I have used these wipes since my 13month old was born. I have loved the pureness and quality of them. However with my recent order they are significantly smaller than previously for the same quantity and the quality of the wipes seems reduced (they are not as strong). So there is effectively less for your money. Also the packaging was ripped open upon delivery, and left outside my house. I will not be purchasing these again",1
6865,"I haven't had root canal dental work, but I suspect it might be like reading this book.I live on the Lizard. I saw the 1999 eclipse from our garden. Yes, it was a cloudy day, but those clouds parted just seconds from totality and we saw it all. A moment I'll never forget.The thing about a solar eclipse is that you really want to be in the path of totality if at all possible. So why would Kit, an eclipse fan, even consider a festival in Devon when totality only covered a slim slice of Cornwall? In Ch 8 the author tells us ""98% coverage is like being nearly pregnant"".There was a festival on the Lizard , and it's ""on the Lizard"", not ""on Lizard Point"" or ""at the Lizard"", Ms Kelly. No one says either of those. The festival was up on Goonhilly where the moorland and huge flat horizons give huge skies for eclipse-watching. Ms Kelly says the festival is at Lizard Point (OK, don't use the real festival) but how can that be twenty minutes from the sea, when Lizard Point is the very end of the country? And it certainly isn't wooded as she describes it. If you are going to use a real location, please give it the respect it deserves and get it right. Or make up somewhere.The author has no feel for Cornwall at all. Everything is portrayed as backward: dirt track lanes, shambling lawyers, bumpkin jury,  Lizard village has nothing to offer, and neither does Truro city centre. She says the official road signs have been removed. What? Why? Everyone knows how desperately we need the tourists. It's not like the Wicker Man down here, you know.Ms Kelly tells us the architect of Truro Crown Court ""must have been a sadist"". The architects of were Evans and Shalev, the team behind the equally beautiful Tate St Ives. And, yes, I do know the Crown Court because my father was a lawyer here. Ms Kelly only uses capital Cs for Crown Court on a couple of occasions in the middle of the book. You always use capitals.Ch 17 talks about IVF. The same old clichéd paragraph that comes up in fiction about women being "" injected and drugged, scraped and invaded"". I've had IVF. It's nothing like this. It's an incredible thing, that we can make life outside the body.In Ch 22 there is a sunset over the North Sea. Was this filmed in Denmark? The North Sea is to the east of Britain.And in Ch 25, we hear how Laura and Kit ""valued [their] relationship too much to let that happen to us"" when referring to the complications of having children (vomit alert).  So why would either of them know the colour of Calpol (as Kit apparently does when he goes to the Faroes, although he also says he leaves Juno to Laura to look after).In Ch 26 we hear that Jamie has a Master's in Criminology. I thought he was an architect (perhaps he'd know about Shalev and Evans?)This one's fantastic. In Ch 27 Laura says Kit should have wrapped his special T shirt in tissue if he didn't want anyone to wear it. Do guys have to wrap clothes in tissues so their wives don't give them to strangers to wear?Ch 45: The ""girls"". Who are the girls? I was lost, but I was so bored and irritated maybe I missed something.This is in a paragraph from Ch 65: ""A dumpy little woman with dark grey hair"", and then four lines later, ""her hair was white"".Surely Kit's semen would have been found on Beth, as well as Jamie's?This is a terrible book, full of errors and sloppy writing, as you can see from the above. I blame the agent and editor as much as the author. But the author has no idea what Cornwall is like, and writes about the place with undisguised contempt. I am excited to find books set where I live or in a place that's special to me, and I want them to be good. This isn't. It's really, really poor.",1
6866,I liked the idea of a wet and dry shaver and at first this unit produced very good close shaves with out any irritation > However the battery performance declined and today 22/06/2014 it stopped working altogether.This is an inexpensive shaver it is not reliable. Do not buy it except for use on a business trip or holiday and then throw it away before it lets you down.,1
6867,"I love the feeling of well brushed teeth after a 2 minute session with this toothbrush, what leaves a bitter after taste is being ignored by Oral-B/Braun support when trying to get the session sync functionality working again after upgrading my phone to Android 7.I'm very close to returning this product after paying a premium for a feature that doesn't work and the manufacturer shows no sign of wanting to address.",1
6868,I love the idea behind this blind but the suckers don't stick so unless you are carrying out an experiment to observe your response to frustration or you want to practice you powers of prediction by guessing which sucker is going to fall of next I wouldn't bother,1
6869,I love these wipes but it seems like these weren't stored properly as at least a third of the top wipes in each packet were dry like the heat had been on them. Annoying when you buy so many at once!,1
6870,I love this tablet when it works....however it keeps breaking and needs replacing.  I am very disappointed!,1
6871,I needed a guillotine for my college work and this product was absolutely awful. I know that it's only cheap but it should at least cut tissue paper which it never. So unhappy that I sent it straight back. Also the size is tiny and for 6.99 it is not worth the hassle honestly.,1
6872,I never write reviews but this blind has forced me in to it. It doesn't stay up the suction cups don't stick even though I've followed the instructions. Last night it must have fell off the window about 10 times. Not what you want when you have a new baby and you're trying to sleep. I was ready to throw it out of the window last night. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy.,1
6873,I only have light stubble and it struggles. Going back to my 10 year old phillashave,1
6874,"I opened these this morning and they have a very unpleasant chemical smell to them. They don’t seem to be the usual texture either, not as ‘watery’ as they’re meant to be.",1
6875,"I ordered the Amazon fire HD 8 for my 3 year old granddaughter because I read that this tablet could be registered using an Amazon Gift voucher as a payment method. Sure enough, in the registration process there's the option to add the voucher ""Claim Code"", which I did.Then, having accepted the £20 voucher credit, the registration process took me back to the requirement for Credit Card entry details, which I have absolutely no intention of entering.I've been a happy user of Amazon for years and have taken reviewer descriptions of this product as a mere ""Amazon Shopping Basket"" with a large pinch of salt.Even so, for anyone to imagine that I'd be prepared to hand a digital tablet specially structured to provide Kids with myriad ""Buy Now"" buttons tied to my credit card details comes as quite a shock. It's not going to happen.Is there any way I can register this tablet without giving a 3 year old child carte blanche with my bank account?If not it's going to be returned post haste.",1
6876,I ordered the wipes and think I received fakes!,1
6877,I ordered these but two iphone s cases hace turned up! Not correct,1
6878,I ordered these screen protectors and they have been delivered already smashed!! Waste of money,1
6879,I ordered this for my three year old grandsons Christmas. The device failed to switch on. Four days later Amazon have sent a refurbished kindle. Very disappointed.,1
6880,I ordered this item instead I received football dice.,1
6881,I ordered this toothbrush in May and unfortunately already the battery has run out to a point where it barely lasts one brush and generally stops mid clean. It takes 24 hours to charge which means you can only use it every second day. Such a waste of money.,1
6882,I purchased My first box of water wipes 5 months ago they came in packs of 72wipes and they were great. I have just bought the same again to find that it's now a pack of 60 wipes and quality is terrible the wipes are dry and rough. I will not be buying these again. I am really disappointed in the product and I don't understand why they changed the product that most people thought was great and we were willing to pay that little bit extra!,1
6883,I purchased this because I wanted to use it to cut paper and thin card for christmas cards/wrapping etc. I've found that you can only put one piece of thin paper through at a time and even then you have to put a fair amount of pressure on the blade to get it to cut - I definately won't be attempting to cut any card if it can hardly handle a piece of paper. I also found it quite small and not really very good for cutting A4 size paper. The blade get's very easily blunt and I've had to go back to a good old pair of scissors. All in all I think this is a pretty poor product from Fellowes.,1
6884,"I purchased this Braun shaver in June 2016!  It has now stopped working completely!I think Braun should be ashamed to sell rubbish!  This is the 3rd Braun product that I have purchased in the last 7 years!Every one has failed!  I will never ever buy another Braun product!  They are complete rubbishSo whoever is thinking of buying a Braun product, please think again!",1
6885,"I purchased this shaver for my husband on 7th September 2017,it is now six weeks later and the foil has split, rendering it useless. Waste of money. Doesn't deserve any stars.",1
6886,"I purchased this tablet on 18th December 2017 whereby my son opened his present for Christmas. Less than 3 weeks after careful use, the tablet stops working altogether and will not switch on nor respond to being charged.I contacted customer service for a replacement and today I've received a refurbished device. Considering I paid for a brand new device less than a month ago and that a refurbished device is not priced the same if sold, it's incredibly poor service.I have expressed the same to Amazon, that recent purchases cannot be treated in the same way as someone making a claim several months down the line.Please be aware before purchasing as despite Amazon having been made aware such is ignored.We purchased two tablets this Christmas and how the other holds up remains to be seen, but if this is anything to go by, neither the quality of the product nor Amazon after care gives much reassurance. By comparison, should a device develop a fault within such a short period of time, John Lewis who sell the exact same device would have enabled a swap for a brand new one. This is Amazon and long distance selling - the quibble is not only mind boggling, but also disappointing so please be aware.",1
6887,"I read other mixed reviews about this item but as I only needed it to cut a few photos for a scrap book I thought it would be fine and ordered.  Mistake!  When it arrived I tested it and it cut one photo fine, however, I then didn't try to use it for purpose until a few weeks later and it never worked again, hopeless!",1
6888,I read positive reviews and negative reviews before trying this product. The negative ones were accurate and more meaningful. Most positive reviews simply praised the product offering very little actual insight.The build quality of the protective case is poor it feels like something I made in school technology class as a teenager. The apps are all controlled by amazon it's too controlled and restrictive.Having to pay to use the device after a period of time is unacceptable for what you get product wise.Finding the apps my kids liked was difficult. Most of the Amazon controlled offering they didn't want and it's a lot of frustrating work dealing with it to find what you do want.If you're concerned about kids safety and security there are ways and means to address that other than using this product.I simply bought used tablets instead with a years warranty then fitted a better third party protective case myself,1
6889,"I really didn't enjoy this book. I wanted to give up on it after even a few chapters but I kept going hoping it might grip me. It didn't. The plot was too predicable and the characters were just annoying, it is very difficult to get into a book if the characters can't even keep you engaged one way or another. The background story of the characters eclipse chasing was just pointless filler, I don't believe many readers will be able to engage with this part of the story. Overall a very disappointing read.",1
6890,I really dislike this shaver. It does not cut close to the skin at all.,1
6891,"I really had a lot of hope for this, but I really don't think it works at all. The suckers just do not stick to the window they constantly fall off (for me right in the middle of putting my ten month old to sleep TWICE)",1
6892,I really hated this book. The plot is unbelievable and I felt that the rape scenes were very gratuitous.,1
6893,I really hoped this would be a good and interesting read. No. Flipped back and forth in time and change of viewpoint. This requires skill but the author didn't handle it well in my opinion. The characters were really boring and one dimensional and I couldn't have cared less if the were all killed off on the first page. Really annoying after all the hype.,1
6894,"I really struggled to get into this book but persevered but I didn't find it got a better,very slow and unbelievable story",1
6895,"I REALLY wanted this shaver to be fantastic. I was looking for an upgrade to my existing 790cc-3 which needed a battery replacement so I though I may as well upgrade.I know that ALL the reviews for this shaver are wonderful and people rave about how great it is but much like the minority in the 1* review section - I must admit that it just doesn't shave properly! You have to go over the same patch time and time again and it still leaves hairs; I notice this is especially bad when they tend to curl back toward the skin (but not ingrown).Additionally, when you have 3-4 day growth, I tend to get the odd hair yank (pain) every now and again with the 790cc; the 9095 is HORRENDOUS for this with a much higher rate of ""yanking"" as part of a normal shave.Must say that I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me so went back for a shave with the 790cc and MY GOD! the difference was like night and day! All the stubbly patches the 9095cc left were gone with one or two sweeps of the 790cc. In addition, I find that the new beard-trimmer is annoying to use as it has a ""safety"" switch and I like to alternate to beard trimmer quickly for especially stubborn hairs and this ""safety"" feature makes this tedious, the beard trimmer is also narrower than on the 790cc and doesn't seem to cut hairs as well - I get the occasional ""yank"" with the 9095 beard trimmer too; I never had this with the 790cc. Lastly, the 790 has an ""intensity"" selection (and maybe this is why it gives a better shave as I have mine on max) where-as the 9095cc does not.In-short; I am availing myself of the Braun 90 day satisfaction money-back guarantee and returning my 9095cc to them and ""refreshing"" my 790cc with a new battery and foil. Won't be discounting Braun in the future as they do make good stuff, but the 9095cc was a massive disappointment for me (to the point where I am unsure whether mine was faulty in some way and thus performed worse than normal).",1
6896,"I really wanted to love these wipes,( I actually hate them) but..They are small, very small! Very thin and too wet  to he honest not good for anything, I wanted to use something with no any chemical, the idea itself is brilliant.. but I ended up using the same pampers as before..",1
6897,"I really wanted to love this product as the Gro-Egg is brilliant, but this is awful! Looks lovely but the suction cups just don't stick! As fast as you're sticking them on one side they're falling off on the other. Think I'll be resorting to drawing pins now.",1
6898,I received an I phone 6 plus screen and when I tried to send a picture to prove it was the wrong order it bounced back therefore I am left with screen protectors I can not use,1
6899,"I received this toothbrush as a present and would much prefer to have the older 5000 edition instead. The main reason is that this one is designed to ""communicate"" with you using this annoying bright blue light (and it you press too hard while brushing, it flashes red which is not less irritating). This light gives me a headache every morning as it flashes right into my eyes. The light also flashes while the brush is charging which is really bright in the dark (and you have to charge it at least once a week as the battery does not last as long). And I am not convinced that having a blue tooth technology is of any value. I've had the 5000 edition for 5 years and it still functions (although the battery does not hold as long), I'd happily exchanged my new 6000 to the 5000 if I could...",1
6900,"I recently bought a Fire for kids tablet for my daughter. While I usually dislike being locked into one content provider, I had bought enough kindle books, Audible audio books, and music for her to justify it.When I went to set it up, I couldn't figure out how to get her Audible books on there, the app was on the parent section but there was no access option.I checked google, where I found multiple complaints that Audible, an Amazon company, could not be used by children.Hoping very much these were old complaints (the new Fire is 7th generation) I contacted Audible, who told me the audio books were transferable. The instructions provided didn't work, however.I contacted Amazon on Twitter with my concerns, and was told to contact Kindle technical help. I persisted and asked for a yes or no answer to the issue of audio books on the Kids Fire, which they refused to give, telling me to call the help centre for assistance.Called the help centre, and a very nice lady did her best. She had no idea and had presumed Audible was accessible, but upon discussing with Audible help confirmed that no, no audio books on Kids Fire. Same goes for Amazon music.She did suggest that the child could listen to music and audio books on the parent profile, but then there is no point in bothering with a children's tablet. Listening on a parent profile means supervision, or yet more messing about with settings.Now, I'll tolerate no Play store and being locked into the Amazon content, as long as it can all be used.But to deny children audio books and music, from Amazon, is unacceptable. This is supposed to be a device that works more or less out of the box, intuitive and simple.Well, that's true, unless you'd like your child to listen to books or music you have purchased for then.As far as I'm concerned, the lack of these core media  is a deal breaker. That this problem, which from a brief google is clearly widespread, is ongoing after seven generations of devices is inexcusable.I've returned the Kids Fire. I'll be buying a regular Android tablet, putting parental controls on it, and then my daughter can listen to books and music to her heart's delight.",1
6901,"I recently bought this curtain for my babies room...it is awful and not fit for purpose, the suckers do not stick to the window even after being 'rolled between fingers' as they suggest. Did not expect this from a reputable company. I did see other reviews like this but thought it must be a one off...its not! Don't want to give any stars as it's unusable as a curtain but had to give it one to post the comment...for use as a tablecloth I'll give it 3 stars but I didn't want a tablecloth!!!",1
6902,I returned as these were tiny,1
6903,I sent this back as the guide is so flimsy that even after practicing for a couple of hours i couldn't get a satisfactory straight cut.,1
6904,I sent this back. It simply wouldn't stick to the window and so wasn't fit for purpose. I was really disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone,1
6905,"I sent this straight back, I had a kids Samsung tablet beforehand but it died after 2 years of use.I've now bought an Acer table and added a kids appI found this tablet too limiting with regards to the content I wanted to addI think you're best buying a good tablet and finding a good app to lock everything down.",1
6906,"I should have taken the previous commenters advice on these water wipes, but decided to purchase and see for myself.  She is absolutely right, I have been buying these water wipes for 2 years now and they have been full to the brim with water.  However, the box packaged with packs does not surpass previous purchases I have made.  The water wipes hardly contain any water and makes it difficult to use.  Why are DermaH20 charging such a high price for 9 packs I have no idea, especially as the water content is so low!  The main reason for buying this brand is the for the 99.9% water feature!  I am really upset with the amount of money I spent on this product and the vendor should be selling it at a discounted price.  The product is not living up to its expectations, especially with its regular customers.",1
6907,"I simply cannot believe that the full price for these earrings is £140. They're ok for the reduced price - £6.99 - but the stone isn't 7mm, it is a tad over 5mm and the only way of making it reach 7mm is to include the claw setting. The packaging was a cheap looking little box.  All in all very disappointing.",1
6908,I stopped reading about half way. No suspense is my first complaint. We get a rape and a trial. Plus we know the victim has turned on the couple who were witnesses and stalked them. The question is why. The problem is I gave up the will to live finding out. Flat characters. Mildly entertaining court room dramatics. I have given this one long enough to get going! I give up. All of you who gave it four or five stars have baffled me. I can't see it at all. I cannot believe how disappointed I am. I can usually count on Erin Kelly.,1
6909,"I strongly advise not to buy this shaver.  The handbook says: ""Braun recommends changing your shaver's Foil and Cutter cassette every 18 months..."". I bought this shaver in July 2015.  Initially the shaver gave a good shave.  After less than a year's use it gives a poor shave and leaves my face sore.  Unfortunately, Braun no longer offers a replacement Foil and Cutter for Series 9 shavers (see their official web site).  I am therefore forced to throw away this shaver and to buy replacement. I have used Braun shavers for the last 30 years.  Time for a switch.",1
6910,I think a normal one would do the same work. I wasted my money.,1
6911,"I took a gamble on this after reading some of the previous reviews but wish I hadn't. Like others have said, the suckers are totally useless and do not stick to the glass in any way. A waste of time.",1
6912,I trie these out on myself as an after loo wipe. They sting like crazy! So won't be using on my baby,1
6913,"I used 2 times this device with gel and dry as well, but I cut my face everywhere and my face burned from the pain after. I would like to send back this product and get back my money.",1
6914,I used both these screen protectors a day after I received them on two different iPhones and both have already cracked. Neither of these phones have been dropped and have just been used as they would have been used everyday. No help whatsoever when replying to their email.,1
6915,I used this shaver until it ran out of charge. I tried different electrical sockets and different two pin converters but to now avail.  I think it reasonable to assume that one should get more than a few days use out of a brand new shaver.  On checking the internet I have found postings from dozens of other users who have clearly experienced the same issue.,1
6916,"I used to love these wipes when they came in packs of 72.  The wipes were evenly moist and soft to the touch...HOWEVER, now they are absolutely RUBBISH.  They now come as a pack of 60 wipes and the quality is horrendous. They are rough and all the moisture sits at the bottom of the pack which means when you open the pack the wipes at the top are nearly bone dry, and when you eventually get to the bottom of the pack the wipes are soaking wet! I end up having to pat dry my baby's bum.  I tried storing the packs upside down in the hope that the moisture would 'even out' but it made no difference whatsoever. I am furious with DermaH2O, why change something so drastically that was clearly a fabulous product?! Greedy manufacturers think we're stupid, that we wouldn't notice or mind a completely different product with a smaller quantity, lower quality and higher price. The so called ""value packs"" are not even value for money with very little saving.  If you have used these in the past (the 72 pack wipes) then I urge you, actually I beg you not to waste your hard earned money, you're better off getting an alternative brand of wipes as these water wipes are sadly now no different to any other pack of wipes.",1

6918,"I wanted it to cut paper and thin card (it says it can do up to 5 sheets of 80gsm) and I did not exceed that.  After a dozen or so cuts I noticed the cut was not clean and the cutting channel filled with the rough edges of the paper/card being cut.  So after a week or so the cutter was pretty useless as it just gives a rough cutting edge.  The flyers etc that I cut look really tatty, and it was well night impossible to clear the channel.(It may be OK for the shinier surface of photos, but it does say it can cut paper and card)I was disappointed as I like Fellowes products in general - that's why I chose it.  But I'll not buy one of these again!",1
6919,"I was disappointed with this book, well written but I could not warm to any of the characters .. only made it to the end because I'm stubborn. Reason I was disappointed? I absolutely cannot abide liars and the entire book is based on more than one of them.",1
6920,I was excited to read this book as the outline sounded interesting and I have read and enjoyed Erin Kelly before. However 5 chapters in I have given up. Very boring and tedious going on about eclipses. I didn't care about the characters and decided to read something else. Maybe I'll go back to it on a long winters day.,1
6921,"I was given this for Christmas as a replacement for my previous Oral B, which did good service for 3 or 4 years before the battery gave out. This one has lasted 3 months. The red warning light, which is supposed to alert you that you're pressing too hard, will not go off, even when the toothbrush is off, so the battery depletes completely between morning and evening, and it takes hours to recharge as that red light is still on. Don't know where the giver bought it, probably not Amazon, but they almost certainly no longer have the receipt. Wish they had read the reviews first. The Oral B website is no help. Don't buy this model.",1
6922,I was really excited to get this pump after lots of research. However only used handful of times as I'm mainly breastfeeding and have only used for oversupply- It is now broken and past the date that I can return. The pump is still trying to pump but isn't drawing any milk out like it did the first few times. I had also bought all the lansinoh bags and extra bottles! I'm so disappointed.,1
6923,I was replacing an old set and I bought two sets from different retailers and the batteries did not work. Finally I tried Amazon and the same! I suspect that in the xmas rush the quality control was lacking to get the orders out.Having used Oral-B for years I then tried Philips sonicare; what a difference it makes to my scale and polish at the dentist. Thanks Oral-B for having a rubbish product as you forced me to choose something that turns out to be so much superior!,1
6924,"I wish I had paid closer attention the reviewers complaining about the battery life. After fully charging the battery, I lost a full bar after brushing for 2:40. The same thing happened again after leaving this toothbrush on the charger for a full day while I was at work.I'm also inclined to believe the charger itself is faulty as I used it to charge my old Oral-B toothbrush and the battery lasted about 90 seconds after three hours on the charger.it's been a little over a week and I'm returning this brush to Amazon for a full refund. At £70 I expected, at the very least, to receive a properly functioning toothbrush, this isn't the standard I've come to expect from Oral-B",1
6925,"I wish we had saved the original packaging. After using this for a week, we’d rather return it. In putting in safeguards for children, they’ve made some highly restrictive choices with no workarounds. For example, you can’t download videos from the library for travel - you can only load videos which you’ve purchased from Amazon. No access to a web browser which seems like a good idea at first. But that ability is shut off permanently so forget using YouTube. This would be more useful if it allowed some options for removing the safeguards.",1
6926,I won't even rate one star. It does not stick at all. Very disappointed.  Total useless,1
6927,I work shifts so bought this for myself to help with sleeping during the day. I'd hoped it would be a good alternative to spending excessive amounts on proper black out blinds. Unfortunately this a product which has a singular purpose of sticking to a window and it fails to do this.,1

6929,"I would give it no stars if I could. What an absolute joke. Don't buy this product. The suction cups don't work, the material is too heavy to be used with suction cups. If the cups do stick, it then falls off after 1 minute. Very dissatisfied.",1
6930,"I would not reccomend this screen protector to anyone as it does not protect your phone, my phone fell off a chair and it went through the screen together and broke my phone screen! Very disappointing",1

I bought it for cutting printed photographs and it does not cut in straight lines - I can do a better job with a pair of scissors!",1
6932,"I would say its just waste of money for me as shaver is unable to shave my neck. I have to spend at least 10 mins  only on my neck with different ways. Meanwhile shaver cannot shave in one go and have to repeat several times to get shaved properly, whatever is the part of my face.",1
6933,"I would say the Oral B's are a waste of money and are damaging to your gum health,  the battery life is awful meaning, as it runs down you don't get an effective clean which leads to problems you can feel it as it loses power after a couple of days.  I will never buy another overpriced and over rated Oral B,  probably will not need to as my gums were so badly damaged I'm losing teeth faster than Bolt can run.  My advice to anyone is to ditch the gimmicks of Oral B and switch to the Phillips Sonicare,  more expensive, I know but the difference is night and day.  Within two weeks my gum health had improved dramatically and the Sonicare was rubbing out stains and leaving my teeth feeling cleaner than ever, I had several deep pockets which with the Oral B were getting worse,  not with the Phillips though,  I think they're reversing in depth, I bought the 6500 which sits doing nothing now I go straight to the Phillips,  3 weeks of battery life and although the power does reduce slightly nearing the end of charge you still get a fantastic clean.I have no affiliation with either company,  I don't sell any of these things.  I'm only advising you to do your mouth a favour and listen to someone who in desperation because of this dreadful brush has lost teeth.Pay the extra and go with the Phillips, you will not regret it!",1

Needlessly complicated and techy (I love having an app for everything, but it feels like this is providing a solution to an invented problem) SO ridiculously loud, and a bit painful on the gums.I used it 2-3 times, sent it back and ordered another Sonicare - automatically times two minutes, simple to use settings, and quiet.",1
6937,I'm 65 and used electric shavers all my adult life - this is the worst one I've known and was left with a permanant stubble. May be it was faulty but I sent it back and din't gey another one.,1

6939,I'm a new mum with a baby. The suckers on this product don't work. I'll stick to blutac and alfoil to block the light so my baby will sleep!,1
6940,I'm disappointed that despite the price paid I still have to purchase an adaptor to fit the 2 pin plug.I think it's a poor service.I don't know anyone who has a shaver point in their bathroom so why can't the appropriate adaptor be included.I now have to wait before I can try this toothbrush.And I will not even talk about the time it took for the shipment to reach me ...Very disappointed with the experience of purchasing this product,1
6941,"I'm genuinely bemused as to why the kindle fire kids gets so many good reviews - on here and in various review articles for kids tablets you can find online. It feels (as it is, I'm sure) that Amazon spotted a market and retro fitted a kid profile onto the adult fire without too much thought/testing.I bought two for my young children, primarily for use when travelling and they have been a nightmare - so much so I have returned both for a partial refund and replaced them with a Lenovo Tab 3 8"".These may work for someone who wants to use it whilst wifi connected however they are almost  useless without a connection - a non exhaustive list of the issues we had:1. The touch screen is clunky and the response is slow - if you're used to smart phones etc it's frustrating. The menu system is also less intuitive than you may be used to with windows / iPhone and the ilk.2. If you have prime - you can't share the videos you download with your membership on the adult profile with the kids profile - you can only share the paid for downloads.3. A number of times the paid for videos I downloaded and shared with the kids profile either didn't work / stopped working / only had sound and no pictures.3. You can download apps / books etc. for use offline in the kids profile however all of the material is still visible when off line and it's not clear which are downloaded (there's a small tick in the corner of the icon) so kids trawl through all the apps trying to find something they can access.4. Mid flight on 2 separate occasions the content on the kids profile just disappeared for no apparent reason - an app would be working and then when you came out went back to the main menu there was no content at all.5. Other apps e.g. BBCiplayer kids only work on the adult profile off line.I could go on but seriously - if you plan to use off line buy something else!",1
6942,"I'm new to electric shaving, the whole idea for it is for convenience and for time saving, I'd expect the shave to be a little bit worse than wet shaving, BUT heres the truth.. This shaver is horrendous You have to go over the same area several times for the shaver to trim the hair, doing so ensures the time taken to shave is twice as long as wet shaving, It's harder, more hassle and more irritating, (constant rubbing 5+ times over skin) than what normal shaving is. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The good points, however. after 15 minutes the shave can actually be very close. It's waterproof and actually is! the little trimmer is good for sideburns, and the battery life is great.",1

It's too big for my grip and every now and then slips out my hand.  My advice is to go for the cheaper one that thinner, last longer on one charge but still spins at the same speed.",1
6946,I'm surprised at the favourable reviews here. I bought a few packs and glad I didn't buy in bulk or subscribe. My third child is 9 months and these are the wettest wipes I've ever used. My daughter has had no problem with many other brands but these do not suit her. i find she's quite moist after them and it has made her quite red. I've found I need to put on baby powder on her bottom after cleaning a poo cos she's quite wet. Too wet to put on cream directly! I won't be buying again.,1
6947,"I'm very disappointed with these wipes. I bought these because they seemed natural, the INCI is composed by Aqua 99.9% and Citrus grandis seed extract 0,1%, it seemed  really very natural, BUT... reading something more about the ""Citrus grandis seed extract"" I found that it's not natural at all, it is composed of mainly diphenyl hydroxybenzene, that is a synthetic chemical (details at http://chemicaloftheday.squarespace.com/most-controversial/2010/1/27/the-truth-about-grapefruit-seed-extract.html).Plus these wipes are really rough and the bottom of my baby became a bit sore. I don't like them at all.",1

6949,"I've been using the series 9 for about 8 months and getting steadily more irritated with it. I use an electric shaver out of laziness. I don't expect a perfect shave but I expect a quick, fuss free adequate shave. The series 9 doesn't deliver. It takes far longer than a wet shave as it needs so many passes to get anything close to a smooth shave and it always leaves a few hairs which then require removing with a wet shaver. Yesterday I went back to an old Philips senseo 3D, what a difference! Two minutes for a  great fuss free shave. I regret buying the Braun,  it's undoubtedly the worst electric shaver I've ever used and an expensive mistake. It's a great shame, Braun used to make by far the best shavers. My first felt as though it had been carved out of stone, had a single simple foil and gave a great shave.",1

The replacement has lasted a little longer, but now is starting to show the same fault.I can't fault the actual shave, not close but comfortable. I easily finish off with a quick shave with a Philips travel rotary. i find rotary shavers pull at my beard. The combination works for me.Still looking for the ideal electric shaver.",1

6953,I've had it on and dropped my phone once and it didn't protect it at all and my whole phone screen is cracked.,1
6954,I've just opened a box containing 12 packs of water wipes to discover that all of the contained packs are defective. None of the packs has the normally in-built and resealable opening on the top which ordinarily enables the wipes to be kept air tight and moist once the pack has been started to be used. The packs of wipes despatched can only be opened with a pair of scissors and the absence of the usual opening means that they dry out within a matter of days and become unusable. I would be  grateful if the entire box are replaced with non-faulty items.,1
6955,I've used water wipes in the past and was always happy with their quality and thickness. But I've just received my latest order and I'm shocked!!They have changed drastically compared to previous batches!The wipes are now SHORTER AND THINNER!!!They're way to expensive to have to use so many wipes during a nappy change.I like the idea of of chemical free wipes so maybe I'll finally have to make the change to reusable bamboo wipes after all. I just can't justify £25 for substandard wipes. Very unhappy with this purchase.bits not what it used to be a few months back.,1
6956,"I’m not impressed with ours , my grandson used it for approx 4 hours and it’s switched off and won’t come back on so I’m returning it .

6960,If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Amazing product!! But I'm furious I subscribed to the price of £10.57 and the price has gone up £10!!!! Won't be ordering again,1
6961,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.Absolutely rubbish! It doesn't cut in straight lines, you have to apply an immense amount of pressure for it to cut and even then, it barely cuts properly. You're better off with a pair of scissors! I've had it for a couple months as I wanted to give it a go, but its terrible! I want a refund!",1
6962,If only I had read the reviews before buying this.  It does state in the information that it cuts photos and A4 paper however I was so disappointed to find that it only cuts the short side of A4 paper NOT the long side.,1
6963,If there was an option for no stars then this would be my rating. Extremely poor pump. I ended up purchasing the Medala brand which is a much better quality. I pump more milk in a lesser time.,1

However what attracted me to this particular tablet was the one year free subscription to Amazon fire for kids.However I did not read the small print, If you live in ireland you can not access it here.And so u loose out on that offer. This should be in big print during point of sale. Pointless buying her a tablet as I could have given her my old iPad. Very disappointed and don’t understand why this offer is only available in certain countries such as Uk?",1

As for the ending - to come out with the one line that 'the probation service screwed it up' and now there's a rapist on the loose hell bent on revenge and then we have co-incidence after co-incidence - just not believable in any shape or form.",1

6973,"Infuriating! The device is ridiculously unresponsive, and there are so many bugs and poor user experiences that I can't believe that anyone would review this favourably if they'd actually sat down and used it. But really, most of its worts could be ignored if it wasn't just so darn slow; unacceptable!",1
6974,Initial thoughts good but after using for two months the shaver will now not charge at all. Cannot return to Amazon as their returns page won't let me. I've now returned to an authorised repairer and will await their assessment.,1
6975,"Initially I was put off by the size and the design but when it arrived it felt like a quality product.I tried to put it up immediately in the larger of my (sunrise-facing) bedroom windows. I couldn't get it to the right size or quite manage to make it stick so I gave up with the intention of returning the product.Then the following day my better half tried and succeeded where I had failed. Hurrah! About six hours later, after a trip to town, I returned to find it hanging off the window with a giant crack in one of the panes. Would not recommend.",1
6976,"Initially looked ok, grip on my phone was decent and it seemed well built enough... Then I had to drive around a corner, which sent the clasp and my phone flying in to the footwell of my car... in fairness though the grippy bit stayed on the air vent... wouldn't recommend",1
6977,Iordered this with kids 1 year fire for kids unlimited. I am in Ireland. The device is saying it does not work on my account.,1
6978,"Ironically, a day after putting this on my phone screen my screen cracked significantly the two times it dropped (not intentionally and a lot less harder than I’ve dropped it before). At first I thought no way could it be the protector but when I finally took the protector off after 3 days that cracking pattern was exactly the same in the protector. Whatever it’s made of seems to be actually adding pressure to the phone screen so on impact the split in the glass is significant! I was replacing my previous one as it had a few scratches on it, but have dropped my phone with that one on before and never had this issue. Very weird.... and now I have to pay to get my phone fixed after 3 years of having it with so much as a scratch on it.",1
6979,"Is just useless, the suction devices dont work, my baby is very sensitive to light, so suddelnly he was sleeping perfect, the bloody curtain falls... I HATE IT. AVOID IT",1
6980,"It broke after a couple of months, and I'm not interested in a replacement.  After I opened it to clean inside, a component snapped off  and fell down the plughole. I was not forceful with it either.When it worked it wasn't  great. It managed to shave the hair from the tip of my chin and from the area under my nose.  But from my cheeks and under my chin, I would have to keep going over those areas again and again and again. This was after 2 days of growth.",1
6981,it broke after just a few months and amazon's return policy was 3 months so i had to just bin it. just stopped charging.,1
6982,"It did not touch my growth at all.I have wet shaved all my life and I thought I would  give it ago, sadly it did not perform",1
6983,"It does block out the light but the suction cups DO NOT STICK to the window, which is supposed to be the idea of the product. I have never been so frustrated with a product and will send it back to be refunded.",1
6984,it doesn't do what it says it can do....My son has coarse hair and the shaver can't deal with it. He's found that using ordinary disposables work better even though they aren't brilliant. We're very disappointed in the product.,1
6985,It doesn't stay fixed onto my window so can't be used.... plus far too large so very bulky. Have had to bin it.,1
6986,"It is almost impossible to make a straight cut with this. I bought this to trim photos and card and its almost impossible to hold them without stabbing the photo with my fingers and leaving my fingerprints all over the print.The rotary knife tends to slide the photos when it is halfway, a poorly designed rail (its maximum deflection is about 3mm! without too much pressure) makes Fellowes greatly descend in my consideration...

Nowhere is it mentioned that you cant access videos in Ireland. According to the rep I have to download games in the parent profile and then share them with the kids profile.But its ok as he ""understands my fellings in this situation""I am so upset right now. Wishing that I had gone with an android tablet instead",1
6989,"It is like using a medieval torture device on yourself.In order to get the shaver to fulfil its intended purpose, to cut stubble, you have to press it with some pressure against your face. This inevitably results in sporadic cuts appearing across one's face and a shaver rash.I would not recommend buying this product to anyone",1
6990,It is not a new shaver. My friend told me this from the package after I had used it. How disgusting!,1
6991,It is RUBBISH ! And the wording used is deplorable. I would not recommend it for anyone at all  get rid of it,1
6992,It just doesn't work. It leaves lots of hair and I end up with irritated skin due to running it over my skin so many times in all directions. Waste of money as I still need to use a razer to pick up the hairs left behind.,1
6993,it lasted 1year omg waste of money never again { how do i fix it,1
6994,it never arrived!,1
6995,It smashed and so did my screen.,1
6996,"It still gives my baby irritation, not the softest material to use against a baby's delicate skin. I opted on using cotton and water with emollient wash instead. It's overrated.",1
6997,It stopped charging properly and it has been less than 6 months of my toothbrush. Also warranty part is not easy and you've to go through the hassle. Better buy the cheaper versions that you can afford to lose.,1
6998,It takes ages to cut the beard,1
6999,It takes forever to charge and even then it barely lasts a few brushings before having to be recharged. It has nice features but it's not practical to keep charging it all the time.,1
7000,It was broken when it arrivedI would like to return it,1
7001,It wasn't gripping and it wasn't shocking. It was boring.,1
7002,It wasn't what I expected. You had to unfold one end to extent it to make it suitable for A3. This was not explained in the description. Sent back via Amazon prime. Full refund so no real grumbles about service.,1
7003,"It wont fit Ford C Max or Honda Jazz.Because of the way constructed it needs a (very) thin air vents.Company has good after sales support, though",1

7005,"It would be great if I could get it to stick to my window, it is extremely hard to get the suckers to actually stick to the window, and even then you have to hope it doesn't fall in the middle of the night.The curtain it self looks good and I like the velcro on it, but the suckers are just bad...",1
7006,"It's a good toothbrush but just get the cheaper versions, i just use 1 mode and the bluetooth doesn't connect effortlessly. Very gimmicky. The pressure sensor is also kinda useless.EDIT: The Battery is failing after 6 months",1
7007,It's a great idea however the suction cups do not stick well and the curtain come off of the window soon after sticking them. It's disappointing,1
7008,It's absolutely rubbish. I dropped my phone with the protector on and it didn't just crack the protector it cracked my phone as well. I would not recommend this protector at all as it doesn't do what it says it does. It's not even glass it's plastic so I am very annoyed because this is not what I wanted. They say it's glass and it's going to protect your phone however it doesn't. It does the complete opposite.,1
7009,"It's not possible to block an entire category of unlimited content easily. If you want to just use the apps and books, you have to individually block each item, and continue blocking new ones as they appear. There should be a single setting per category that hides that category entirely from the child's profile.It doesn't handle disconnection from the internet particularly well (most of the app images disappeared, even though the apps themselves were still there) which is a shame, because one of the primary use cases for this sort of thing is to keep kids entertained while travelling.Performance has declined significantly since we purchased it.Have tried to get the Google play store working on it so that I could use the kids games I'd paid for there (rather better than the 'unlimited' selection on this tablet), and did, for my profile, but could not share apps with child accounts.",1
7010,It's not tailored specifically for children as it was the reason for purchase.,1
7011,"It's not very good. It took me ages to shave with this and even at the end I had to use a conventional razor to get the hairs which this product would just not cut, no matter how many times and different angles I approached it from.Waste of time and money.",1

7013,it's rubbish !  either I have a faulty one or this is just rubbish !,1
7014,It's so hard to get it to stay attached to the window. It always falls down after 15 minutes or so. The only way I can use it is by closing a window into it.,1
7015,"It's too expensive for wipes..It's hard to pull a wet wipe out... Plus they always get stuck together when I manage to pull 1 out. Such a waste...I'd recommend the Huggies wipes.. cheaper, and they do the same job.",1
7016,it's totally useless.... i really regret to buy it....,1
7017,It's very noisy and doesn't clean very well,1
7018,Item nothing like picture and no explanation as to why I have been sent a different item. Very disappointed. I will be asking for a refund.,1
7019,"Its a damn surprise that this company has been able to deal with the SHOCK at how shoddy their products are, considering their 'shock absorbing' 'tempered glass' screen protectors are about as reliable and effective as a flip flop made out of sandpaper and thumbtacks. The protectors arrived late, with only ONE of them intact from the journey, the other exhibiting perfectly how this product does not work in the mail. Perhaps someone had stood on it. Perhaps it had been dropped from a great height. But no height could would be far enough to fall to relieve me of the pain I feel knowing that this product is sold as any form of 'protection'. Perhaps I would sleep better at night knowing that this product is correctly used elsewhere. Perhaps as see-through eggshells. A small niche, I understand, but a damn sight larger than the brains behind this doomed venture.",1
7020,Its good but I am a bit annoyed that I cannot find the replacement cutter heads cartridge for the 900 series. The only ones i can find relate to the 7 series not the 900s. Can someone please helpalantreed@sky.com,1
7021,"Its not as good as i expected, As  i work night i was looking for a something to really black out the room. It take about 80% of light.  I wouldn't recommend buying one.",1
7022,"Its OK but I have to use a wet razor to get the bits of hair the electric won't trim, which makes the point of using an electric razor a waste of time.",1
7023,Its outrageous that a company can get away with downgrading an already expensive product and charging the same price after a considerably reduction in size AND QUALITY. Im out of myself! how can we expect integrity from the companies that are suppose to supply natural/nasty free products for our precious babies when they are ripping off us in our face and get away with murder?NO WHERE it mentions that the product spec has changed or was re-designed so bought the whole box just to find out they decided to spoil the best water wipes for babies in the market. Ive returned it and chasing brands. PERIOD!,1
7024,Jesus not stable at allIm telling you dont get this,1
7025,Just as others have noted the material is total black out but the curtain will not stick. The suction pads are atrocious. It won't stick to the window or the the upvc surrounds either. Defo waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!!,1
7026,Just avoid. Freezing cold to touch (making my baby cry and jump every time) and so incredibly over priced. Switched to Huggies for 50p a pack! Still 99% water and no nasties. Soft to touch and do the job. Won’t use these again and don’t recommend.,1
7027,Just awfulIt won't stick to the windowWaste of money,1
7028,Just cannot get in to this book...it just seems to be all over the place!! I might try again but wont be in a rush to do so.,1
7029,Just couldn’t get into it! I ve tried and failed many attempts! Will try again during the summer!,1
7030,Just got the toothbrush and the Smartphone holder missing from the box?? Now I have to go through the tedious process of returning the product when all I need is the smartphone holder. Not happy at all.,1
7031,"Just got the wipes, the EXP: FEB 2018, definitely need return it!!!",1
7032,Just got these blinds and is a huge disappointment. I spend most of my time trying to get them to stick and they don't.  Wouldn't recommend this product.,1
7033,Just received my screen protectors and both of them are to small for my phone screen and one of them is cracked. I'm not happy!,1
7034,Just too small  is not for adult or girls  but only babies  earing .,1
7035,"Keep in mind that these are 60 wipes per pack and not 72. Given that the 15x super saver pack of 72 wipes isn't coming back, these are a good option, the individual wipes have the same size as the ones on the 72 wipes per pack. 4 stars for reducing the number of wipes per pack and for not putting the 15x back in stock.EDIT: See my other review on the ""9 value pack"".",1
7036,Keeps crashing,1
7037,Keeps falling down! Not the best of things when your 1 year old is just dropping off to sleep to suddenly be dazzled by sunlight and the noise of it slipping down!,1
7038,Keeps on falling down.  Made my own.,1
7039,Kept falling down did not stick for longer than a couple of minutes and couldn't really fold them up either.Very disappointing. Sending them back to the company.,1
7040,"Kept going because it was recommended to me - bored but was expecting a great denouement. Boy was I disappointed! Nothing about the ending was in any way credible - more like laughable, gullible in the extreme, dreadful, need i go on .....?",1
7041,"Last time, I bought a Philips Arcitec razor reading reviews here. That was one of the worst decisions of my life.",1
7042,"Lasted a total of three months before the head fell to pieces after some very delicate cleaning with the supplied brush. I replaced the head exactly as was before and now makes a huge amount of noise and hardly works at all, almost 45 minutes for a shave. The return window from Amazon is for one month only so now stuck with a completely useless and not fit for purpose lump of plastic, cheers!",1
7043,"Leaves your mouth feeling very clean but be wary of the floss action brush head, the longer rubber bristles slapping around chipped two of my lower front teeth. Can only give one star to a product that cost me the perfect smile(braces for 2years) and hundreds of foreseeable pounds spent at the dentists  to fix the damage.",1
7044,"Like majority of reviews, I struggle with the sucktiin cups. They actually fall down now matter how hard you try to stick! I’ve resorted to buying Velcro for it, however this has proved difficult too. The Velcro struggles to keep it attached to the window too due to its weight, despite a lot of extra Velcro being added. I’m forever putting this blind back up and I’m running out of space to put Velcro on. This was for my babies room and I’ll go in  and it’s fallen down! Causing my little boy to wake soon as the sun is up! With the very hot weather we have had lately I’ve noticed his room is even hotter than anywhere in the house. I have touched the blind and no word of a lie, it’s scorching hot!! A real concern for me! I’ve taken it down for safety. This blind also isn’t one size fits all, luckily I have a window the size is ok for but anyone with a smaller window will have excess blind to deal with which would make it even harder to keep up.",1
7045,Literally couldn't cut butter,1
7046,"Literally the worst product I have ever bought. The suckers simply do not work, so if you do manage to get the blind to stick to the window, within 5 minutes it will be on the floor. Completely and utterly useless, I would give it zero stars if possible",1
7047,Look really good it's been on two weeks now and has a huge crack in it! Phone hasn't been dropped or bumped either. Good idea but the real thing has let me down.,1
7048,"Looks great but did not last long. The rubber prongs to squeezes into the air vents rip apart as the internal is sharp metal. The pressure of pushing in the product, pushes the metal through the rubber grippers.The holder also kept falling off. I do wonder if the designers actually use the product beyond looking at its design?Ok if you leave you phone permanently on the holder but not durable enough for day to day usage.",1
7049,Looks the business with a good design but the shaving is terrible and leaves your face patchy and doesn't give a smooth shave. Avoid.,1
7050,Made my boy's bottom really sore! I switched back to Huggies and soreness disappeared. These wipes are not worth the money...,1
7051,Made of good quality fabric but the one we received has a fundamental flaw in that every third or fourth sucker won't remain attached which is incredibly frustrating. Tried everything including cleaning glass and suckers without success. Both top corners keep falling away meaning lots of light early in the morning.,1
7052,Makes a normally short and painless task long and trivial.Shaves areas inconsistently leaving you with an uneven shave every time when you could use a disposable razor to better effect,1
7053,Managed to break the vent on my new Polo whilst pushing it on.  Not happy.  Possibly my clumsiness but it didn’t meet my needs and I now don’t want to try it again just in case it breaks another vane on the vent.,1
7054,Massive and it wouldn't stick to the window. No use for medium /small windows.The weight seemed to pull it off the window,1
7055,"Maybe the ending is great but sadly after reading the first third, I've given up. It's dull dull dull.Characters are one dimensional, settings are drab and the back story as dull as dishwater.Sorry, had to give up. Life is too short.",1
7056,"Might be good but not my cup of tea, gave it up after the first chapter",1
7057,Mine did not come with the required stickers in order to put the tempered glass on therefore I could not even use it,1
7058,"MINUS 5 stars, absolute waste of time and money, the suction caps are poor rubbish, trying for ages to attach the blind but would not stick to anything, you might as well just throw your money away if you buy this, rubbish",1
7059,"Misleading, does not come with UK port",1
7060,Much smaller that it's for kids not for women...,1
7061,Multiple packets (at least 5) in this box of 12 were split leaving the water wipes dryer than they should have been.,1
7062,"My first electric toothbrush was Oral-B 9900. Wow! Such a joy to use. Strong and effective and a true pioneer of its time. Unfortunately it died after two years of use.This model has similar characteristics and is based on these successful series. Because technology advances they added some gimmicks like bluetooth. Other than that the toothbrush is almost similar. I will also compare this toothbrush with the Philips Sonicare model.Pros:+Electric Toothbrush+Toothpaste includedCons:-NO LITHIUM BATTERY-Cheap Quality of plastics (supposedly MADE IN GERMANY)-Expensive-Bad ergonomics (handling, feeling)-Smart Guide is flimsy and cheap looking (LCD screen also is not protected like older models)-Cannot tell which clean mode is on-Cheap looking Blue Led light consuming battery with no use-Deceiving model (same as cheaper ones disguised to cheat customers to pay more)-Useless Application and bluetooth technology-Nothing new and innovative compared with the last 3 years modelsMy first impression when I saw this toothbrush was really disappointing. Cheap plastics, bulky design even the SmartGuide looked flimsy and cheap compared with my older OralB model. Usually I do not read manuals but I pretended to be a good user and started reading. With my surprise I saw that I had to charge the battery for 24 HOURS! I immediately said to my self, wait... that means NO LITHIUM battery?! And yes my fears became reality. I spend almost 100 GBP for a model that does not have a lithium battery. We are in 2015 and OralB still uses old NiMH batteries?? THE MOST important characteristic of the electric toothbrush IS the battery! Why? Because when we brush our teeth and put the battery BACK to the charger we slowly destroy the battery as it is charging over and over. NiMH batteries need to be discharged and charged again in order to be maintained. So what is the problem you will say? The problem is that WHEN the battery starts to discharge the toothbrush DOES NOT BRUSH WITH THE SAME POWER, meaning it has poor performance and less pulsations per minute. So you have to choose. Have your battery fully charged and DIE after 1-2 years? Or brush your teeth worse. Your choice. Brushing sensation is mediocre, toothbrush feels bulky inside my mouth (compared to Philips Sonicare which is slim) and the handle is also bulky and made of cheap plastics. I was REALLY impressed that this model is MADE IN GERMANY as apparently the quality is so CHEAP!!!  This cheap-looking-energy-consuming useless blue LED light is so annoying, also does not even display the cleaning MODES! Generally save your money from this model and apparently from Oral B, as it seems that their overpriced and overrated!",1
7063,"My last razor which is 10 years old cuts better then this Braun razor very disappointed with this product, have just ordered a new razor head for my old razor .",1
7064,"My mum bought this for my daughter and was told that it would work abroad. She can't watch any of the videos as I have now found is because they can't broadcast outside the uk, as we live abroad it makes it pretty useless, the apps work but next year when my free period runs out I will be paying £4 a month to only be able to use part of a product  not Amazon's fault but it was bought from John Lewis's maby the people selling them should have some basic training",1
7065,My phone screen still smashed with this product because it doesn’t cover the whole screen,1
7066,My previous rechargeable oral b was brilliant and I had it for about 5 years before replacing the battery as it was loosing its charge really quickly. The new battery only lasted about a year but again started loosing it’s charge really quickly so I replaced it with a Philips sonic toothbrush which never left my teeth feeling as clean so 1 month later I bought another rechargeable oral b but again it is loosing charge really quickly now. I bought it in Oct 16 so it is less than 2 years old - really annoying to have to replace such an expensive product so quickly,1
7067,My pump isn’t working as well as it was when I frist got it. And now return window is closed. What do I do??,1
7068,"My son has very sensitive skin so these were the only wipes I could use on him.  I have purchased these wipes before and i eas pleased wuth them  However, the manufacturers have increased the price and compromised on the quality. The wipes are not wet at all, almost dry to the point where I have to dip them in cooled boiled water!. I am so diasapointed as I purchased a 9 pack! I thought it was just an odd pack but I am on my third pack now and this pack is dry too!",1

7071,"Nice idea but no different to other wipes. Still has preservatives and certainly was not kind to my baby's bottom. Better choice was Pamper's Sensitive. Even better is just water and cotton wool. On the go, I travel with bottled water. My baby's bottom has never looked healthier.",1
7072,Nice idea but... Half the suckers don't work!,1
7073,"No clue how there are so many positive reviews, this is the worst shaver I have ever tried! Takes forever to shave and you need to go multiple times over the same spots again and again.Actually bought this for trimmimg body hair but it s quite useless for that purpose so decided to try shaving with it and it was equally bad.",1
7074,No it was all smashed when I received it,1

7076,no longer charges after being purchased in June. Amazon's 'return window' is closed.,1

'He always gets like this before an eclipse' ---- who goes chasing round the world to see it when their wife's pregnant with twins?  Didnt like any of the characters or their weird morals.  Such a badly matched couple to start with - he needed a boot up the backside.  Just couldnt be bothered.,1
7079,No stars!!! Both were smashed/broken when arrived. Can't return and can't request a refund. Complete waste of money!!!!!!!!!!,1
7080,No they are crap they are not sticking won't be buying anymore of here,1
7081,No trimmer! Thoroughly inadequate!,1

7089,"Not A4, not A 3So it is useless to me",1
7090,"Not as advertised. Bought as  Christmas gift fro my two kids. Did not come with the kids free time app. Despite multiple calls to amazon customer service, multiple call terminations and multiple transfers to inadequate people Amazon never fixed the issue (and we bought two for our kids!). I could have bought any old tablet but paid the extra for this app and the kids security features on the Fire. Not the Christmas presents the kids deserved! And certainly not how I wanted to spend Chrstamas morning!",1
7091,"Not as close a shave as I expected,",1
7092,Not as described have to return,1
7093,"Not as good a rotary shaver. Does not shave evenly. Despite cheap price, would not purchase again.",1
7094,not as good as shown in the pix. The earrings look cheap. Not worth the money.,1
7095,not as i expected but did the job,1
7096,Not as picture showed  you can hardly see it on too small for me ,1
7097,"not bio-degradable, therefore they pollute our oceans and are not sustainable.",1
7098,NOT BIODEGRADEABLE or I would have given it 5 stars. The least amount of chemicals possible but very disappointed that it is not biodegradeable.,1
7099,Not deliverd on time and absolute rubbish.will keep as a waring to others.So small had to get magnifiing glass to see them.,1
7100,not efficient as promised.,1
7101,Not even a year old and the battery does not reach full power. I have charged it for 2 days and only 3 lights flash.Do not purchase.,1
7102,Not even worth putting on it cracked after only a day i didn’t even waste my time applying the second one,1
7103,Not fit for purpose.  Suction cups are bent and distorted and just do not stick to the glass.  Returned for refund.,1
7104,"Not fit for purpose. Ignore all the fancy-pants accessories and sales blurb - its an electric toothbrush fitted with a substandard battery.Takes forever to charge and only lasts a handful of uses before needing to go on charge yet again for a day.I wish I'd done more research on this piece of junk before buying it. Sadly its fitted with an old generation battery and not the newer lithium-ion, which is much better suited to this type of device.If you enjoy watching your fancy new electric toothbrush flashing away for days on end as it very slowly charges then you'll be delighted with this beauty. Just make sure you get yourself another toothbrush to actually brush your teeth with, in-between charges.",1
7105,Not good enough ! Iv only had it a few days and it's already got a crack will not recommend it to anyone !!!,1
7106,Not good enoughHorrible battery lifeWell overpriced for what it is,1
7107,Not good I only order bk in June and it will not charge for my son at all. I have tried x3 difervent chargers. It won't even switch on,1
7108,"not good, I was hoping it would work after reading peoples complains. unfortunately I gave it a day. it falls down. I have lots to do and cant be continuously putting back curtain and risk waking the baby.  it had to go",1
7109,NOT GOOD!,1
7110,"Not great really, hard to cut without jamming into your fingers",1
7111,Not happy at all - suckers don't stick to the window making it pretty useless. If I'd have paid full price I would have been furious. Going to try it for tonight - if fallen off by morning it will be going back.,1
7112,"Not happy at all with this product, doesn't work how it is supposed to. The only bit that I found actually worked was the pop-up precision trimmer. However the actual main part of the shaver was quite frankly crap. For the price it costs, i'm not happy with the product I recieved.",1
7113,Not happy with this product.....doesn't stick to window well enough and comes away from window completely defeating object of having these blinds!,1
7114,"Not happy, does not charge, only had for a week!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
7115,"NOT HAPPY! This item has BROKEN the vent of my car (Audi A3 2008). I installed the mount as per the instructions on the box. In doing so, it pushed and bent the connecting metal in the vent. I am now unable to open and close my vent using the toggle!Beyond DAMAGING my car, this vent has a very unfriendly user experience. Opening the clasp is difficult. It requires some grit and finger strength to ply open. If you're unable to get your phone in to the clasp in time, it snaps at your fingers. When taking the phone out as well, the clasp seals shut rapidly, scratching or pinching your fingers.I would never buy this kind of device again or recommend it to anyone!",1
7116,Not impressed at all!!! So disappointmented with this tablet- both my sister and I bought two for our boys and because she then drove back to south of Ireland after Christmas and I flew back to Abu Dhabi after Christmas nothing works. The videos never worked even when in UK and customer service have been so unhelpful- saying that it’s due to geographical restrictions even though they weren’t working when within the geographical area!!! The whole point of tablets is to be able to travel with them to anywhere in the world! False advertising about a Years free unlimited access when you have to actually remain in the UK to avail of it. So frustrated and disappointed!,1
7117,NOT MY CUP OF TEA AT ALL SORRY,1
7118,Not my kind of book gave up after two chapters,1
7119,"Not pleased. You can't cut an A4 page on the long edge, the cutting position isn't very accurate, and you have to press down hard on the plastic strip to get it to cut at all. It's now gathering dust. I was trying to get one cheap, and I paid for that!!",1
7120,Not pure water as thebname suggests. They have something in them that irritates thebskin. I think it has something lemony in it.,1
7121,"Not quite as advertised. I wish I had read more reviews first.I purchased this Kindle Fire 8 to replace my son's Kindle Fire 6 which he has had for two years, and due to the lack of storage on the 6,  in comparison,  I thought the 8 would be great for him so he could download more apps etc for when we are on a car journey for example.Whilst setting it up, I discovered a-lot of apps that were free on the Fire 6 are now only available on the Fire 8 by paying for them.So I never finished setting it up, and am returning it to Amazon.Very disappointed in this change.Have to also include that my son was not happy with the huge size increase in the Fire 8.It it ain't broke don't fix it kinda situation.",1
7122,Not read Can't get o to kindle,1
7123,Not strong enough and too small. Wouldn't buy one again,1
7124,"Not sure if I have superhuman stubble, but this shaver seemed reluctant to remove any.",1
7125,"Not sure which is worse, this useless product or the useless company that pretends to deliver it. FGalls off every single time. Suckers are useless. Working now thanks to my 1.99 gaffer tape.AVOID!",1
7126,"Not sure why so much positive reviews.  One it takes longer than a wet shave, two its pointless for on the neck.Price right at 34 however I would be well annoyed if I had paid rrp or even close!",1
7127,Not two months later the product has broken. There is a small component under the central blade and when this breaks the shave is very unpleasant as it pulls at the hair it is trying to cut. Was very good before that but two months is a very short period of time to see this kind of breakage.,1
7128,"Not very easy to put up. Some of the suction cups don't work, kept coming away from the window and letting light in. No matter how many times I try to adjust it keeps happening again and again, I am so fed up with this. I bought a different brand that worked perfectly first time. Do not bother with this, it is useless.",1
7129,Not very effective,1
7130,Not very good,1
7131,Not very good cuts paper squint not what I expected,1
7132,Not very good had to return would not cut,1
7133,Not very good won't stick to window for more than a few seconds. Thinking of returning item as it's not fit for purpose. I would not recommend this product,1
7134,"Not very happy only brought this a few weeks ago for our grandson for Christmas and its gone done in price, I think Amazon should give a price guarantee on things like this",1
7135,not very sharp or stable,1
7136,Not very strong. Placed it on the vent of my car and it damaged the vent. Haven't used it again! would rather use it one with the suctions,1
7137,Not what I expected,1
7138,"Not what i expected, I have a old Phillips wet & Dry shaver, Far better",1
7139,Not worth a penny - not accurate at all.  Cuts off the lineRUBBISHheres 6 more words right here,1
7140,Not worth it.  suction cups all bent out of shape  stopping them working.  Sheet is way too big.  Having to bunch it up with the velcro defeats the object of a blackout blind as every place you  bunch it up  allows light in.  Sent it back for a refund,1
7141,Not worth the Money - even at 50% off which seems to be the standard for electric brushes - to be honest if it was at 90% off then perhaps but is just a poorly supported gimmick.,1
7142,"Not worth the money at all, dropped my phone from a foot off the ground and my screen smashed leaving my screen protector in perfect condition. I now have to pay to have my screen replaced completely even though my screen protector is in one piece. Not happy at all",1
7143,Not worth the money brought for a gift the person was very upset about them,1
7144,"Not worth the time or money. The sucker pads do not work and the blind fell down in the night, waking the baby. Tried again but it still will not stick to the window for any length of time.",1
7145,Nothing like picture much smaller than expected. Very dissapointed. They arrived quickly though.,1
7146,now having to pay for my screen to be fixed as it ruined my screen and the screen no longer works,1
7147,"nowhere near the quality of the series 7 - only real advance is the series number, big step back from top quality of previous series. save yourselves some money and do not buy",1
7148,Number of packets ripped which was evidenced through wet boxes.,1
7149,"Ok so this must differ by type of beard. But I to have to report that this dealt very badly with the flat lying hair on my neck, totally falling to shave it much at all and eventually irritating the skin. Tried over a number of weeks and no improvement. Wet shaving is just far superior in this respect. I suspect there's just some people for whom these shavers just aren't going to work very well. Shame!",1
7150,"Okay for first few weeks, but doesn't really cut very well after its been in use for few weeks!Disappointed - is all I can say!",1
7151,One blade that sucks...,1
7152,"One of the feature i bought this toothbrush for is the red sensor that blinks when you apply too much pressure. Unfortunately the sensor is not working properly, first it was showing always red now it never shows red no matter how much pressure.",1
7153,one of the screen protectors was broken on arrival,1
7154,One of the screens came cracked.,1
7155,One of the two screen covers came cracked already !!!!!! Terrible,1
7156,"One of the worst purchases we made before our littlen arrived. The fundamental issue is that it doesn't stick, therefore completely useless. We're well out of the returns period so can't send it back but I wouldn't even give this away...i'd feel embarrassed for passing it on to someone else.",1
7157,"One screen protector arrived already broken and cracked, the other one felt much flimsier than other protectors I've bought in the past and cracked completely across the first time my phone bashed something. Rubbish!",1
7158,One screen protector was cracked and the other wouldn't stick!,1
7159,"One Star because there isn't an option for NO Stars.So, I bought one of these a while ago, and it worked fine, but the little clock stopped working very shortly afterwards.  The screen would just display a load of gibberish but the actual toothbrush worked fine.I lost that toothbrush, and so I bought another one, exactly the same.This time the little clock that was supplied was very poorly made, and it started displaying gibberish as soon as the returns time was up.... then the toothbrush itself developed a complex, and keeps thinking that it is being used too hard and displaying the red light.  It also will not go through any of the modes.Don't buy one - What ever you do do not buy one of these",1
7160,"Only comes with EU plug,so I need a UK adapter to use it here.That should have been ADVERTISED!!!",1
7161,Only fit iPhone 6 so useless for me. I needed 6s and they’re obviously way too small. I also have a 7 and they don’t fit that either as the shape is obviously different. Very frustrating.,1
7162,"Only got one glass screen protector, the other was just a piece of plastic with a label on it to act as if it was real. Stickers didn't even hold protector in place and unstuck as soon as I flipped it over, meaning I had to re-apply it 3 times. I have used glass screen protectors multiple times before so it wasn't like it was my mistake.",1
7163,Only had kindle for few weeks and now won’t hold its charge. Trying to contact amazon for return or repair is near impossible!!! Still trying,1
7164,"Only half the suction pads stick to the window, despite careful cleaning. Would be great if it worked! Is currently a waste of money.",1
7165,Only received 11 not 12 waterwipes!,1
7166,Order a iPhone 6s screen protector  but instead received an iPhone 6 Plus. Very annoyed with it,1
7167,Order cancelled for no reason ????  Refund issued.,1
7168,Ordered 2 covers and 1 cover was damaged inside the package - see photo - poor quality,1
7169,"Ordered from Prime Now. Opened it and it wouldn’t switch on which instantly worried me I’d expect it to have at least some charge. Tried charging and nothing. Was a surprise for my boy, so really disappointed. I’ll stick to handing down my old iPads in future.",1
7170,Overblown and plodding - didn't engage me at all,1
7171,"Paid £25 for these wipes thinking that they would be best for my babies skin oh how I was wrong, they have left my babies extremely sore. Would not recommend to anyone.",1
7172,paid a lot of money for this and it doesn't stay up just fall off the window all the time. iv tryed everything to keep it but nothing holds it. was ment to make my daughters room darker but no such luck.,1
7173,Pathetic suction DO NOT BUY,1
7174,"Please avoid if you can.Shocking quality.First full charge took almost 3 days.Now after 3 months battery completely flat after one brushing session.""satisfaction guaranteed"" only within 30 days from purchase, so return asap if you can",1
7175,Please do not use on double glazed windows! I took the blind off my daughter's window this morning and it's cracked the inside pane from top to bottom. I've since Googled it and discovered it's a common problem. I'm livid.,1
7176,Please don't waste your time or money. Received today and the suction cups simply don't stick to the window. Even with added moisture! Will be return asap,1
7177,Please take caution before buying this - developers of app are using strange restrictions: you simple will be not able to download an app. I'm getting message:This app is incompatible with all of your devices.Why?,1
7178,Plodded through this to the bitter end.Has to be one of the most boring books I've come across. It started off well but wish I hadn't bothered reading the rest. Forced myself to plod on with it. Total waste of time.,1
7179,Poor,1
7180,Poor battery life,1
7181,Poor doesn't stay up longer than a few seconds.. not worth the money.,1
7182,"Poor performance for  a product that, in the past, I have found very reliable. The toothbrush requires more than an overnight charge and then delivers only two days of use before requiring a further charge. Hence no more than 10 minutes or so of use!! So many bells and whistles available, but the designers forgot what its main function was! Do not buy.",1
7183,"poor performance, doesnt cut even when pressing hard, which then causes chaffing. steer clear!",1
7184,"Poor product if i am honest, doesn't cut properly, always missing areas even though going over the same area 3 or 4 times. very disappointing  about this shame i cannot get a refund for this... DONT BUY!",1
7185,Poor product. No even shaving.,1
7186,Poor product. Stopped working and charging after 12 months,1
7187,Poor quality Bought in April 2017 but attachment broken by December!,1
7188,Poor quality crap! The clamp snapped off as soon as I clipped it into the vent. Didn't even manage to do one journey with it before it broke. Avoid this cheap rubbish and spend a little bit more on a trusted brand instead.,1
7189,"Poor quality, one broken.",1
7190,Poor quality. Fell apart in my hand after a week with the head flying off and a tiny spring disappearing down a plug hole making it completely useless. Better to spend more and buy something reliable. Not a good product for Braun’s reputation.,1
7191,Poor quality. Turned ears green !,1
7192,Poor quality...does not cut well,1
7193,"Poor shaver, have tried using it dry and wet and it does a crap job at removing shaving your face.  Does not remove all the hair on your face, leaves loads of hair gaps and overall it is just a very poor shaver. No idea why people are giving it 5 stars.",1
7194,Poor. Suction caps don't work. Useless. Can't return as opened it too late,1
7195,Possibly one of the longest most drawn out books I have read where nothing actually happens.  I kept reading for this 'big revelation' which when it came down to it wasn't worth it.,1
7196,"Possibly the worst investment I’ve ever made. Out of the box it’s fun, your kid will like it. But very quickly you will use up the storage and then you have the devils own job at getting back on track. We bought an Amazon recommended SD card to massively increase the storage, mounted it, can we get anything to move over? No. The device continually displays critically low storage and then doesn’t let you get into various apps. I’ve bought a number of Apps that won’t load onto the SD card and won’t install and yet I still get charged. This last week I’ve spent about 6 hours trying to sort this thing out. Time wise I wish I’d just bought an IPad as it wouldn’t have sucked up so much of my time. I’ve always loved Amazon but this device has brought so much frustration that I’m writing this review. Don’t buy!!",1
7197,"Pretty flimsy, small and generally not very good at cutting. I will be having to buy another more substantial one....",1
7198,Pretty much bought this product based on reviews.. but thats my fault. The product is pathetic.. my a £1 for a bag of 10 bic blades does a better job of shaving. No idea what people liked about it.. dont buy is my verdict,1
7199,Previously they was goodNOW THEY ARE COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY. MATERIAL HAS CHANGEDAND ITS NOT AT WET AS THEY USED TO BE. AND THE WIPES HAVE GONE SMALLER !!  Do not buy !! From this person. Feels fake.  8/6/16,1
7200,"Priced at ""taking the p*ss"" range. £6 for a box of sensitive wipes at ASDA.",1
7201,"Probably the most man-hating book I've ever read, where every male character is either a liar, a cheat, or both, and every female an angelic heroine. Such obvious discrimination doesn't exist with race, but apparently it's fair go for gender.",1
7202,"Probably the worst personal grooming product I've ever bought!! Biggest waste of money!! It simply failed to give me an adequate shave using normal pressure, I virtually rubbed my face raw trying to get it to shave close, my face is now red and blotchy, and I ended up having to finish the shave with a wet razor. A completely useless product IMO, I would advise people to avoid this shaver and just buy a Gillette instead!!",1
7203,product arrived incomplete,1
7204,Product came and suction cups all warped and wouldn't stick to the windows on all three blackout blinds. Returned to supplier who only refunded one of the blinds out of three! Not impressed!,1
7205,Product good but children's web browser does not work and have been in communication with Amazon for a month trying to get it sorted. There is no consistency in customer service with one telling me it is currently a known fault with the device and others taking me through troubleshooting that I have completed on several occasions with several customer service agents. This is a Christmas present for my children and I now have little hope that it will be ready for Christmas day. Still waiting for a successful outcome.,1
7206,Product is rusty already on one part despite it being dried after each use. Very disappointed,1
7207,Product is supposedly for use wet and dry. Used it wet and it malfunctioned. Now doesnt work. Will buy phillips net time,1
7208,"product looks so cheap.when charging, it doe not hae charging light shown. Confusing whether it is working.",1
7209,Product quality and size changed for the worse. A very unhappy customer.,1
7210,Product suction cups do not stick to windows,1
7211,Product very disappointing . Blade is not sharp and overall cutter is flimsy . Tried to register the product to return and on line registration will not work . I would not recommend this trimmer,1
7212,Products came smashed!!,1
7213,Products suckers don't work properly so blind doesn't stay up.,1
7214,Protects the phone screen but u can’t type when it’s on so no good 😕,1
7215,"Pump stopped working on battery mode after only 3 days of using it on batteries. (Prior to this, I used the pump once!) Very disappointing as I was on holiday and the pump stopped working on the third day which meant I could not pump at all on the airplane on the 8 hour journey back.",1
7216,Purchased as a Christmas Present. Had no base charger in it so they are using an old one,1
7217,Purchased mid November 2016 and by mid Jan 2017 the charger has stopped working!,1
7218,Purchased this as a Christmas present and it has lasted just 7 months. Will not charge or work. Amazon sending me a replacement so will let you know if it lasts any longer.,1
7219,"Purchased this product but the feature that I bought it for is not available to me, you rejected my review and as a result other customers might also be misled. I believe it is IMPORTANT that all interested in this product know that they may not be able to use all the features of the product they order.",1
7220,quality of the wipes in this pack is very different. I had bought the 4 pack before and the wipes felt lovely to the touch. The wipes in this pack feel much rougher on the skin. disappointing.,1
7221,"quick delivery (very good) although upon opening the packaging both screen protectors were smashed. Cheap, but a waste of money.",1
7222,"Quite disappointed, tries to do too much and doesn’t get the basics right. Must be better options on the market.",1
7223,"Read about 15% of the book and that was all I could tolerate, I love reading books where I know places and I did know the places but sadly I just couldn't get into the story.",1
7224,"Read some of the 1 star reviews. It takes 3 days to charge it and after 3-6 months full charge last 2 min 24 sec. Also it's not like Philips toothbrush, it will not deliver 100% of performance for 10-14 days and when it can't deliver, it will switch off and won't start. This will deliver 100% for first brush and with every next brush you will notice less and less of vibrations/rpm. My cheap 3 years old Oral-B tooth brush works better than this.",1
7225,Really annoyed with Amazon! came today with European plug. Now I have to go to Currys and spent another fiver to get it to work.So no stars yet and no stars for Amazon.,1
7226,Really disappointed with the stick-ability of this blind.  Have to put back up several times a night.  Compares badly to the first black out blind bought 3 years ago which is still sticking well.  Poor quality for the price.  V disappointed,1
7227,"Really disappointed with this blind, the suction cups don't stay stuck to the window and the blind keeps falling down.",1
7228,"Really disappointed with this product. Used it for one night on my window and it worked great, second night I put it up again and it will not stick to the window AT ALL. I tried five times and gave up, left it in a heap on the floor and will be returning it for a refund asap.",1
7229,"Really disappointed,this book sounded great,bit as usual fake reviews on Kindle giving it high rating. Book starts well bit gets so boring and slow from about 10% in until 70% ,the rest is ok,boring end,no surprises. Way way too much boring info about eclipses,what's that all about,? and all those chapters with kit on the boat going to eclipses , absolutely boring,pointless should have been removed from book,that woman he meets from old times and her hubbie bill... pointless....his brothers troubles... pointless...mentions of his father.. pointless...I would only get this book if it's free on unlimited,don't waster your money,also suitable for people who enjoy reading books that put a lot of details about eclipses in them",1
7230,Really disappointed. Ordered a new one to replace my older one which was a bit tatty after many years of use. New one does not stick to the window. Waste of money,1
7231,"Really dissapointed in this product, no matter how hard you try not all the suckers will stick to the window. I have tried all the suggestions from the manufacturers (cleaning the windows with alcohol and drying them, warming the surfaces etc) but the blind still comes off. Waste of money!",1
7232,Really good if u have a lot of patients which I don't it didn't stick to the window so sent it bk,1
7233,really slow book not enjoying it at all,1
7234,"Really sorry to say this, but these are the worst wet wipes I've tried. They are rough on a baby's skin, very dry, making it virtually impossible to wipe a bum clean. It is also impossible to pull out a single wipe at a time - they always stick together and come out only as a group.",1
7235,"Really thought as it is a fellowes brand it would be good unfortunately it is not!! It is not accurate at all, the blade is blunt after one time use and the plastic that you put pressure on to secure the paper is not sturdy to say the least! You are better of with either a pair of scissors or a much more expensive one.",1
7236,Really unhappy as I bought this for a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He put the batteries into the timer and this is how it appears. It doesn’t actually work. Disappointed.,1
7237,"Really unhappy with this, which is such a shame, as I bought it as a gift for my partner. The reviews for this product seemed good, which is why I was drawn to it. It powers up fine, the blades move, but it just does not cut. You go over the same area numerous times and it really barely cuts a thing. It's like trying to cut with a blunt razor, and the replacement heads seem quite expensive, so don't know if it's worth doing. Can't get a refund on the product as I bought it early and wrapped it up early.",1
7238,"Reasonable enough shave BUT - I Bought this on June 12th 2016 and by 8th June 2017, less than one year later, it had a major battery recharge malfunction and overheat! It was so hot I feared it might self combust so I threw it outside on some gravel.Needless to say I can find no way to complain to Amazon regarding this purchase online. Just as well it was not full price. My previous razor, a Phillips lasted years. I only used it as a follow up to my blade wetshave and prefer this style to the rotating heads so not heavy use by any means. From the quality, reliability, customer service and safety perspective I would totally avoid!",1
7239,Received my delivery on Sunday- noticed that the wipe packet is reduced in size and are definitely not the same as the order I received last month. They have changed the packaging and also I could squeeze the water out of the wipe before but now it's like any other wipe.Not impressed.,1
7240,Received ok but one was damaged and cracked,1
7241,Received these in the post today. Both the screen protectors are completely smashed!!! Waste of money,1
7242,Received these with cracks in them. Cheap quality.,1
7243,Received this product and it had a slight bubble round one of the apertures. Thought it would be okay but it smashed when dropped. Not worth what I paid for it. I'm afraid I will not be purchasing anymore from this company. B.McC,1
7244,Recieved my screen protectors today. One smashed and shattered upon opening,1
7245,"Reduced quality, smaller size and higher price. Don't bother ordering these wipes, they are no longer the same. I absolutely loved these wipes for their thickness and how wet they are. But now they are dryer, thinner and smaller. Really greedy and poor decision on WaterWipes part. Will be buying Johnsons and Pampers from now on.",1
7246,Reduces sensitivity of screen and not glass. Glass doesn't bend. I have used tempered glass screens on iPhone 5s but still to find a decent one for  a 6s.,1
7247,replacement foil not available.DON'T BUY,1
7248,"Returned it very pootr quality, but customer service great refund was processed without quibble",1
7249,Returned the first pad as it wouldn't charge. Now on our 2nd pad and guess what issues with charging.  So far it's been on for over 24 hrs and isn't fully charged,1
7250,"Returned, not fit for purpose",1
7251,"Ridiculous! People have managed to brush their teeth for decades with no need for a stupid phone app telling them how to do it. Electric toothbrushes clean teeth better than manual ones, but I cannot see any point in this app or this toothbrush. It does nothing that cheaper brushes do just as well. This is a pure gimmick, and a very expensive one. Avoid!!!!",1
7252,Rubbish,1
7253,"Rubbish , takes for ever to get milk , disappointed",1
7254,"Rubbish build on spindle , too flimsy fell apart after one week of light use",1
7255,"Rubbish charger, Great toothbrush !  the charger is now not charging after only being used for 3 months",1

7261,Rubbish smashed in the post.,1
7262,Rubbish the glass wasn't even sticky so couldn't even stick it to my phone !!!😡😡😡,1
7263,Rubbish waste of money. Downloaded tv programs for long flight and wouldn’t play them after 30 mins into flight. Problem still not sorted by amazon after emailing them 3 times!! Wouldn’t waste money buying one again!!,1
7264,rubbish wont even remove 1 day stubble,1
7265,"Rubbish, after watching the adverts about these razors & how good they were supposed to be,  I'm very disappointed with the quality of shave I got. I would have liked to give NO stars as the razor was leaving stubble on my throat and by my ears. I used it wet & dry but still rubbish. Not worth the money",1
7266,"rubbish, pulls the hair out",1
7267,"rubbish, waste of money and the suckers dont fit on the glass very stupid and they are a like a domino effect when they fall",1
7268,Rubbish! Don't waste your money get a pack of bics!,1
7269,Rubbish! Suction cups misshaped and no matter what I do will not stick to my window... Maybe I'll try super glue! I'm a night shift worker and it just keeps falling into my head...waking me up!!,1
7270,Rubbish.,1
7271,Rubbish. End of...,1
7272,"Rubbish. I probably should have done my research before hand, but who nowadays expects a tablet WON'T support Google apps like YouTube and Google Maps? It works ok for now, that is until the years subscription to Fire for Kids runs out, then this thing will be practically useless.Sort your life out Amazon and let us download Google apps. Otherwise customers are going to turn away when they realise the Firetablets don't deliver the things every tablet user expects.Also, please stop sending emails every time I download a free app. I didn't purchase anything, so please leave me alone.Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there, but these things need to be said.",1
7273,Rubbish. Rubber cover on vent clip came off after a week.,1
7274,Rubbish. Wouldn't say up. Waste of Money.,1
7275,Rubbish.Broke within 48 hours,1
7276,"Sadly after only 20 mins, yes just 20mins of use it switched itself off and wouldn’t do anything! Annoyed but have sorted out a replacement.",1
7277,Scratched my airvent !!!!!,1
7278,screen does not work.,1
7279,Screen glass doesn’t really cover the screen,1
7280,Screen protector arriced completely cracked and unusable - very disappointed.,1
7281,Screen protector arrived with a shatter on the screen protector - go figure!  Cant see this protecting the screen much.  very disappointing.,1
7282,"Second Oral-B toothbrush I purchased. I did not buy this model on Amazon as I found it cheaper on a competitor. I love how nice it cleans but I'm not going to be replacing the toothbrush every 6 months because these muppets at Oral-B cannot bother to use a lithium battery like the ones on mobiles. They use the old fashioned Ni-Mh batteries, the ones with ""memory effect"" that lose power over time, leaving you with a limpy toothbrush that doesn't clean as well over time. A Lithium battery does not just go limp over time, it either works or it doesn't. I want my toothbrush to have the same performance/power at 6 months or a year down the line as it did on the day I unboxed it. Actually scratch that, it's a toothbrush and not a mobile so the battery should last years, 5 or 6 years at a minimum. Sonicare from Philips use Lithium batteries but they are not as good as the Oral-B for my teeth, so I'll just go back to normal manual brushes until Oral-B stops making gimmicky bluetooth brushes and just sticks to the basics and uses a better battery that is more reliable. All this replacing is not friendly to the earth, throwing away a £80 brush every 6 months is BAD for the pocket AND the planet. Shame on you, Oral-B! No more gimmicks, just a reliable product please.",1
7283,Seems they have known it does not work with Android 7 since at least March (now mid July) and are not particularly interested in fixing. Will think again before buying another Braun product...,1
7284,Send it back as it doesn't stick :( but other than than that good product,1
7285,"Sent mine back. The window suckers didn't hold to the window (and our windows are brand new) and even while I held it up, light was still getting through. They need better quality suction devices really.",1
7286,"Sent them straight back: suckers are too shallow for such a heavy material. Fell down constantly after 90 minutes of trying to get our 110"" wide window covered we gave up. Terrible. Not at all like my friends version she has had for years. Very very disappointed. Poor baby still has too bright a room. I had such high hopes for this product, too! Come on Gro, I am a huge fan of yours. Such a shame.",1
7287,"Seriously boring, gave up after skim-reading the first 20%. The characters are neurotic and pretentious and I feel like the author is trying to impress me with knowledge of eclipses and recreational drug use. I wasn’t impressed, I was just bored and really couldn’t care less about whether the psycho killed them or not (especially as she hadn’t even been introduced at the time I quit reading)",1
7288,"Set up children’s ages 5 and 9 and moved to books options innocently thinking it would be child/ teen books turns out as presumably as my prime shared with partner and her kindle book fifty shades of grey. I was presented with suggestions of sex novels including one called PENATRATED.this is wholly inappropriate.Secondly set safe website and browser won’t connect, but kids games and films work ok.I’ll alter review if this “glitch” is sorted as it made for awkward situation with my 9 year old Daughter.",1
7289,"Shallow, unattractive characters but oh so right on. Or so the author thinks. Waste of money and time. Be warned!.",1
7290,"Shaver is the worst thing I have ever experienced, does not shave properly at all. Stay well clear of this product, the only plus is the extendable shaver on the top.",1
7291,Shipped to the UK with a continental plug,1
7292,"Shocking, not worth it, head is blunt and after a week requires you to fork out for new head.  Rip off, buy something else. Worst buy yet by far.",1
7293,should have bought a dutch philips instead of german,1
7294,Should have heeded the advice of the 1-star reviewers. This product performs worse than than my clapped-out 8yo Panasonic shaver. It's going to meet the same fate. Poor shave and poorly designed product. Not value for money.,1
7295,"Simply useless. It won't stick on the window, which, incidentally, but stay close in order for it to ""work"" so not ideal in the summer.",1
7296,Slow and shallow,1
7297,So disappointed as both screen arrived shattered! :-(,1
7298,So disappointed I wish I read the reviews first! It is the most frustrating product I have ever bought it takes forever to put up as the suckers do not sick to the Windows and when you finally get it up it falls down! I will be returning it's terrible. If is was possible to rate it as a minus I would.,1
7299,"So disappointed with this blind. It just doesn't stick to the windows, regardless how many different ways we have tried it falls off.I had a blind the same as this years ago & it was perfect.Won't be ordering another one.",1
7300,So far I’m really disappointed and frustrated with this kindle! Maybe I’m doing something wrong? But unless we are at home (on Wifi) my daughter can’t watch anything. I have now purchased amazon prime videos (at an added monthly cost!)  so I have downloaded a few videos via my account but they are not showing in my library so unable to transfer to her profile for her watch. So far I’m really regretting this purchase as it doesn’t seem to do what I need it to do (ie. watch movies for the 5 hour car journey we have tomorrow),1
7301,"So i decided to buy what is supposed to be the best electric razor on the market, after not using one for around 6 years.Last one i has was a philips wet/dry when they first came out. I am 40, blonde hair and usually have a wet shave every morning or i can just about get away with it every other day.I have sensitive skin, especially around the chin and my face cuts easily,hence the reason for buying it.The bottom line with this and all electric shavers is it just does not get close enough. I can go over the same part of my face time and time again, pulling and streching the skin, but you can still see the bristles. Had a shave with it at 8am, bare in mind i have blonde hair, and i could do with going over my face again come 5pm time. Dress the advertising up as much as you like, with fancy names, etc, bottom line,its not very good. Can see the bristles still on neck, even though i go over and over. Tried it using gel, same as a dry shave, rubbish.I so regret buying this, wish i could get my money back. I really dont understand the reviews prasing this item, unless they have got it for free as a promotion, i promise you, it is utter rubbish compaired to a wet shave.Positives is i dont get a rash, and the box is fancy.Negatives,the shave you get is total rubbish,patchy at best, just does not get anywhere near close enough. Oh and while i remember, it tells you you need to clean it after every shave, costing a small fortune in cleaning liquid. Would not have a problem at all with this, if it was any good, trust me, its not.buy at your peril, a real shame you cannot try before you buy. Mine is going on ebay, expensive lesson learned",1
7302,"So noisy. The sonicare I usually buy seems so much quieter but I thought id give this brush a go, wouldn't buy it again. Good for people who have not experienced sonicare tooth brush  though.",1
7303,So poor does even take any hair of my chin do not buy,1
7304,"Some of the pads are not smooth enough, as a result do not stay on the window. Disappointed.",1
7305,Son dropped his phone today (after only a week) screen smashed.. enough said😢🙄😫,1
7306,Sooooo disappointing! You need wi-fi at times even to watch a movie you have paid for a downloaded! - each time you watch it apparently the license needs to re-new so you need wi-if. Rubbish for being in the car/out and about because it nearly all needs a wi-if connection. I feel amazon are not at all honest with how these work! Wish I had bought apple and have movies able to work all the time.,1
7307,sorry after about 5 chapters I just couldn't get into this book so gave up and gave to a friend to see what she thought. she hasn't read it yet but I would definitely would not recommend this book. great disappointment,1
7308,Sound was all fuzzy on it,1
7309,Speaker died on me and had to return it not very happy,1
7310,"Spent over £20 including delivery for this item and its not up to standard. The quality of the curtain is great but the suction parts that stick to the window (that actaully make the product work) dont stick, so cant get a fully blacked out window without taping it up with other materials",1
7311,Still only using as electric toothbrush waste of money,1
7312,"Stoped working after only 3 months , barely used the gadget that comes with it , not worth spending the extra cash",1
7313,stopped using it after a week or so not good at shaving so no good,1
7314,"Stopped working... It shows that its fully charged, but stops after 30 seconds.",1
7315,Such a shame ! Some of the suction’s would not stick despite trying on different windows they just kept dropping off much to my annoyance,1
7316,Such a shame. My daughter absolutely loved this! We got it for her birthday 1 day ago and now we are sending it back. Not to be replaced but for a refund. Quite simply it does not work. Neither do the replacements according to forums.  The volume does not work. I have reset the device. Set up new profiles. Downloaded suggested apps. Nothing works. The volume will not work whilst trying to watch and videos. Even the videos it suggests in front of you like Peppa pig etc. It will work if you watch a video straight away but if you then use an app and then go back to watch a video the volume is stuck on mute. You can slide it up with your finger but then it just resets back to mute. I chose this over Apple because I much prefer Amazon and android but i can see now why Apple charge a bit more. You can actually hear things on their products. Do not waste your time. Daughter was so upset and now we have to send it back and buy another one from elsewhere.,1
7317,Sucker bits don't stick on the window meaning the product is pretty useless now. Shame it would have been really good if it worked,1
7318,Suckers dont stick to window despite preparing window as suggested and the material isnt exactly blackout. We ended up spending more money on velcro to fit it. Very dissapointed,1
7319,Suckers just don't work. Some bent or misshaped and just seem too cheap for the job. Working well by being trapped in window frame but does not do what it says,1
7320,Suckers won't stick to the window so blind is totally unusable.  Don't waste your money.,1
7321,Suction Cups are funny shapes so don't stay attached to the window waste of money as doesn't stay up over night. We are on our second one which will be returned shortly,1
7322,Suction cups are so so bad ! I had to pin this to the window.. not great.,1
7323,"Suction cups are twisted and difficult to stay up, I wish I'd bought a different product. The blind falls down a couple of minutes after its gone up!",1
7324,"Suction cups are useless, only 2 of them actually stick to the window, the others just come off, waste of time and money !",1
7325,Suction cups continually fall of & light gets in around the edges.Returning the item,1
7326,"Suction cups do not work on a normal window. The first one start detaching even before I finish attaching the fourth one. At this point, this product is useless for me. The windows are clean, but the minimal moisture will not even allow you to adhere the suction cups.",1
7327,Suction cups do not work. They will just not stick,1
7328,"Suction cups don't work, horrible buy.",1
7329,"Suction cups were very difficult to stick. Even once they'd stuck on, they kept falling off. Not much use for keeping out morning sun if they fall off in the middle of the night.We returned it - we have a small child, so couldn't be spending loads of time every night trying to get the silly thing to stay up!",1
7330,"Suction is terrible, it will not stick to my windows and is therefore useless. Not what I expected from a reputable label. I shall be returning.",1
7331,Suddenly screen became faultyKeeps hanging,1
7332,Supper rubbish,1
7333,"Takes absolutely ages to shave, even on moist, warmed skin. Almost impossible to get a smooth shave. The clipper also feels too flimsy",1
7334,Tedious,1
7335,tedious...I  didn't connect with this at all.,1
7336,Terrible,1
7337,Terrible barely cut a thing,1
7338,Terrible battery life after 6mths it barely holds a charge a day it's infuriating! Plus my mouth never feels cleaned properly.,1
7339,"Terrible battery life, weeks old and battery only lasts for 8 minutes, sent back and the replacement has exactly the same problem.",1
7340,Terrible device that has not worked properly since it was opened on Christmas Day. Unfortunately no one can help us. Such an expensive gift that does not do what it is supposed to do,1
7341,terrible item both screen protectors came smashed. very flimsy & not worth the money,1
7342,"Terrible product - does not stay attached to any window, I regret buying it as hanging a towel at the window is more effective",1
7343,Terrible product. Does not cut paper properly and cannot fit a4 paper sideways.,1
7344,Terrible product. Doesn't stay stuck onto the window - waste of money,1
7345,"Terrible purchase! Does not stick to the window for longer than 5 minutes. And this not a blackout blind, the fabric is not thick enough.",1
7346,"Terrible shaver, cut me and just pulled long hairs out.  It took took me double the amount of time and involved using my old shaver anyway!",1
7347,"Terrible, bought to cut 350gsm card, but due to the cheapness of the guillotine, it doesn't cut straight. Using a pair of scissors is easier and gives a better cut.",1
7348,"terrible, not accurate. doesn't cut straight . cheap crap. only expensive paper cutters are good. used it once and asked for a refund.",1
7349,Terrible. Didn't protect my phone whatsoever. Mig crack through my phone and the screen protector didn't help at all. Highly do not recommend.,1
7350,Terrible. Difficult to install and damaged my air vent in the process. I threw mine straight in the bin. Do not waste your money!,1
7351,"Terrible. I have two Series 7 shavers but they are getting old. Those and this Series 9 (£184) all came via Amazon.The Series 9 is a great disappointment and a total waste of money. It does not shave nearly as well as the series 7. After a few hours you can feel the bristles whereas the series 7 usually lasts for a full day.The Series 9 takes approximately 3 times as long and he shave is far from perfect weather is flexible or fixed head potion. The Series 7 can be used mostly in the flexible head position.Finally the Series 9, having given a poor shave, is more difficult to clean than the Series 7.",1
7352,TerribleDoesn't stickIt's terrible!!!!!!!!!!,1
7353,"The battery does not last like it should. Worked fine for a month, now it has to be charged every other day. It goes completely flat. Not worth the money.",1
7354,The battery last only 1 day if that. It takes 24 h to charge it so it is a bit frustating.....,1
7355,The battery life on these products is terrible! 1.5 days max if you are lucky! We have spent £100's on Braun products over the years but to be honest this was the last time! Unless Braun do something to improve their poor products DO NOT BUY THEM!,1
7356,"The beard trimmer is a slider on the back of the shaver.  If I had written this review a week after getting it, I'd have given it 5 stars.I've given it only one star, because even after cleaning it after every use, and after only two and half months, it basically started acting as if the blades were dull. It left iron filing like whisker paste across my face. Which left my face sore as I tried to clean it all off.I got a refund and bought something over £100 more. A total waste of time.",1
7357,The blind doesn't stick to the window. Poor quality blind.,1
7358,"The blind was a pain to put up, the suction cup don’t hold for long, one of them even came off on first use. After a week of constantly falling off and waking my son up with bright light, I ended up using duck tape to hold it on all sides, then it worked and was actually black out. The material is good for blackout but the cup is rubbish. Using the tape meant i couldn’t open the window plus it was ugly to look at the window from outside. I’ve just installed a perfectfit blind in my son’s room which does the job and looks attractive both inside and outside. I look forward to binning the gro blind. I will not recommend this product.",1
7359,The Bluetooth only works with the latest Android Operating System 7.1. Worth checking you can get this update first.,1
7360,The blurb claims a fully charged battery lasts for many hours.  We've had ours for a couple of months and it lasts no more than an hour. Useless for travel. Do not buy!,1
7361,"The box leaked, the blue ink ran from the print on the box and ruined our nursery furniture, very disappointed",1
7362,"The box only contained 11 packs, not 12!!",1
7363,The charger for the shaver does not fit into regular plug sockets,1
7364,"The charger or battery have a problem, it never get full",1
7365,The cord doesn't fit in the shaver so impossible to charge. Unfortunately I forgot about the return window so now I can't get it replaced :-(,1
7366,The curtain itself does the job but suction caps just don't work. Not worth the money,1
7367,The cuts are not precise (made not along the guideline). If plus or minus 1-2mm is OK for you - you may buy it.,1
7368,"The descriptions of these products say they are made of ~99% water. This is patently misleading. They are made of 80% polyester. They're just another disposeable, single use plastic item destined for landfill at best, blocked sewers and polluted waterways at worst. Use cotton wool and water. It's a damn site cheaper and you just don't need to cause this kind of environmental damage for the sake of convenience.",1
7369,The design just cannot cope with different size window frames and the suction pads are too big to stick on narrow plastic window surrounds.  The idea that the tucks that reduce the width/height of the blind can be of a fixed size is ridiculous as window sizes are not readily divisible by the chosen tuck size.  The designed wanted to make a universal blackout blind but he didn't have a workable idea of how to do it.  I've torn my hair out trying to eliminate the edge gap light leak to no avail and the system cannot produce the promised blackout that we required.  How I go about getting my money back I'm not sure but I advise against this product unless you have the same size and format windows that the designer did!,1
7370,"The first one I ordered broke after two weeks. It literally just switched itself off and wouldn't come back on. No power at all.  I contacted Amazon, who were very prompt in sending out a replacement via next day courier, however, the replacement had the same fault (after about 4 days of use!) and I've now had to return that as well. I loved the tablet and it would have been perfect for my 19 month old so I am very disappointed that there seems to be a manufacturing / design error on this model. I wouldn't recommend.",1
7371,The foil faded quickly (within 3 months). Got a replacement at GBP 82 and it has last 6 months+. So from factory must supply only the cheap ones,1
7372,"The foil is obsolete so they cost a fortune, shave isn't very close and the cleaning solution is very harsh on the skin... My £30 shaver does a much better job and that's about 10 yrs old using the original foil.",1
7373,"The glass doesn't stay stuck to the screen, buy another product!",1
7374,"The grips on this mount are not close enough.  I tried to mount it in a zip car I rented the day after I got it and it wouldn't hold on the vents.  It was a Ford C-Max, so it was pretty standard in terms of vents, but the grips on the back just wouldn't hold it in place and as soon as I tried to put my phone on it, it would fall over.  Completely useless....",1
7375,The holder has a good spring system and holds various sizes.Fits well in the car vent grill.However the design of the grips is poor which means when you pull the holder off the rubber feet come loose and fall into your air vent system never to be found again.,1
7376,"The idea behind the item is good,but when it turnt up the suction pads didn't work. So returned the item and went for one that used Velcro.",1
7377,"The idea for this book is very good - the same story told from different people's perspectives but the excecution is poor, unbelievable and quite predictiable. Not a book I'd recommend and an author I wouldn't read again.",1
7378,"The idea is good, but the suction cups don't stick properly... as the reviews show some people say the opposite... so, I think it's like a lottery!",1
7379,The issue is that the suckers do not attach properly. The blind itself blocks out 95% of the light until just before you finish putting your child to bed at which point it falls down and wakes them up. The only way to insure this product works correctly is to use the Velcro ( white is best if you can get it as it is not so obvious). But this is supposed to be a travel blind and you can't put Velcro up when you are visiting other homes / hotel etc...!,1
7380,The item was already used. Returned for a refund but haven't received any information yet. Very disappointed.,1
7381,The item was exactly as I expected and delivered promptly.,1
7382,"The last 20% of the book is good, and has a few twists to keep you guessing. I really struggled to get into the book and came near to giving up several times before I got to that point.",1
7383,"The material from which the blind is made is fine and blocks out the light well, but the suckers... they do not stick.  I followed all the instructions, I cleaned the inside of my windows well beforehand, but to no avail.  The suckers are made from a type of plastic which is inflexible and is too hard.  In addition two of the suckers had manufacturing kinks.All in all, not a good quality product.  Best avoided, will be returning mine.",1
7384,"The material is good for blocking out the sunlight’s, but the suckers are of such poor quality plastic (cheap and not very rubbery) that it wouldn’t stick to the window panes.  We ended up have to jam it into the window.",1
7385,The one purpose of this product is to stick to the window.... Unfortunately the suction pads don't suck and therefore don't stick to the window. I've been using this product for a week now and it falls down every time we use it. It's a shame as great concept otherwise. Having said that it is also very expensive for what it is.,1
7386,"The only two things I can say in its favour are: it was 99p and had a good plot.If I wanted such detailed information about eclipses I'd look at a different genre than crime and then I wouldn't have been so bored. I accept that the eclipse factor was essential to the plot but a simple ' ... go to all the eclipses and take photographs ... etc...' dialogue would have sufficed. And then there is the constant swearing - I know I'm not the only one who is offended by it, so if other reviewers feel the same, would you please say so, then readers can decide whether or not to buy a book. It is still an offence to swear in public in the UK.",1
7387,The package was already opened and unsealed and seems to be a resale. The seller wants me to deliver it to a collection point in another town which i cannot do. His webpage for returns does not allow to ask for a returns prepaid potage slip. i want to drop its off at my local post office. This is not good enough.,1
7388,The picture is the blue one but what I received was a black one,1
7389,The print is pretty. They do really block the light out. BUT only for the 5 min that the curtain actually stays put. Horrendous sucker cups. Waste of money!,1
7390,the producet not as the same.on the shop sale. less water in side,1
7391,The product came I thought it would be glass it's not. And came broken.,1
7392,"The product did not work,fast delivery though.",1
7393,"The product does not hold itself up on the window at all - I've cleaned the window accordingly and followed all instructions, but it did not work.",1
7394,The product doesn't stick and keeps falling off the window,1
7395,"The product is not as good as the original water wipes, I purchased it thinking its the original product as the box is similar but find out on delivery that it is not the original water wipes. Wipes are dry as well.",1
7396,The product it's self works fine but what annoyed me was that one of the screen protectors was smashed when I received it.,1
7397,The product seems good but the package was awful. It was torn and looked that it had been opened before. I'm truly upset about this. I didn't return only because I ordered this as a gift and I need it for tomorrow. Otherwise I would.Above all this the I ordered this on the 29th and on the site appeared as delivered on the 20th! Had to contact the Amazon support for that too. Awful.,1
7398,The product that came was defective. The suction cups were not working and the blind kept falling every couple of minutes. Very disappinted with quality of the product amazon is sending through.,1
7399,The red light bright all the time,1
7400,"The rubber grip on on one of the prongs ripped off when I first tried to fit it, the vent grips are aren't fitted straight with the rest of the unit, so your phone sits at an angle, there is some scratching where it was originally fitted to the vent and after struggling to fit it, I try to remove my phone from the holder, the whole lot came out. While I had it fitted, sometimes (not all the time), it would activate the edge display on my S8.I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this product.",1
7401,the savers heads follow out and cannot be replaced this is ruddish,1
7402,The screen protector does not cover the whole screen of my iPhone 6s. Recently dropped my phone to find out this screen protector does not work,1
7403,The suckeres are a bit rubbish,1
7404,"The suckers are bent out of shape and don't stick to the window.I bought the same blind from Argos and didn't have any problems, so was hoping this one would be of the same quality.",1
7405,The suckers do not work!! Every time we have tried to attach this blind it falls down. We have tried it many times on different windows and had no success. It would be useful if it actually worked as the material is 100% blackout. Very dissappointed as it is expensive for something that doesn't do it's job!,1
7406,The suckers don't hold up the blind - useless,1
7407,The suckers don't stick.  Keeps falling off.,1
7408,"The suckers for this product are rubbish, and you can't open the window if this product if you manage to get this product up!!! Do not buy",1
7409,The suckers have never ever stuck to the window I had to tape it up.,1
7410,"The suckers on this blind, like a lot of people have mentioned before, are just awful. We use it when travelling and it takes an age to set up the blind for it only to then fall down mid nap, not ideal at all. Please change something about these suckers or future buyers will only be left disappointed. A hugely frustrating and disappointing purchase.",1
7411,"The suction cups are useless. Very difficult to get them to stick. When they do, they come off some time later during the night. Some work, most don't. Even after following the instructions.",1
7412,The suction cups do not work. Has not worked since day 1. Waste of money. Very disappointing since gro company normally does good quality products.,1
7413,The suction cups don't hold to the window after just a year of very little use. This happens every night. The blind is really useless.,1
7414,The suction cups don't work at all. If you can even get it to stick to the window it last about 5 minutes before falling down. Terrible product. Total waste of money.,1
7415,The suction cups don't work I have stuck the blind up using the Velcro,1
7416,"The suction cups have NO suction at all! Unable to attach to window so this is a completely useless product, very disappointed.",1
7417,The suction cups just do not work and the blind falls off the window so it is of no use at all!,1
7418,The tabtel speed and quiality are perfect for this price or better but 1 year unlimited time not working,1
7419,The three cutting heads became displaced after just over a year making it virtually impossible to clean and then reassemble the razor. I've used it maybe 20 times so it's ended up costing about £2 a shave. I have bought a Braun instead.,1
7420,The timer doesn't workDoest connect on Bluetooth,1
7421,The toothbrush handle does not connect to the oral B app or the oral B smart guide,1
7422,"The toothbrush only remains charged for 3 days, so I cannot go away with it.",1
7423,The toothbrush will not charge anymore,1
7424,The wipes are dry,1
7425,The wipes aren't folded into each other which makes it really hard to pull out and not to mention unhygenic for the little one because I have to put my finger inside the pack to pull the wipes out. Quite shocked to see this in such a well known make.,1
7426,The wipes arrived in different packaging to my normal water wipes and most definitely feel different. Not convinced these are genuine,1
7427,The wipes i recieved in ny subscribe and save box  (9 packets) smell absolutely horrible. They are also not wet like they usually are. They smell of mould. Very disappointed,1
7428,The wireless computer screen does not work with the toothbrush which is a complete let down. maybe why it was listed in the Prime day?,1
7429,The worst product. Please don't attempt to use this if you are even remotely stressed out or sleep deprived. So frustrating. The suction pads are bent and so don't stick to the window even with added saliva. Yeah gross. Sorry,1
7430,"the worst toothbrush ever!!! the battery lasts two days and then takes two days to charge, very impractical",1
7431,There  was no attachments - only shaver ! Sent back!,1
7432,There are 4 for cleaning and image 6 How to Get 2Fund was not well closed,1
7433,There is no extra smart plug in the box.It says it's included.  How are you supposed to charge your travel device if no plug !!!!!!,1
7434,There is no hole where the front camera should be as per the enclosed photos.,1
7435,There was no charger in the box,1
7436,These are NOT natural because they are not biodegradable and that is not good news for the sewers and all the animals that end up eating plastic infused wipes!!,1
7437,"These are only £2 a pack for 60 in boots, so this is far more expensive!",1
7438,These are so wet and cold. They dont come out of the packet in a sensible way. You have ti get your wipes out vefore you open the nappy. Not great mid poonami when you need more wioes abd you have ti go digging around in the packet rather than the next wipe popping up when you remove the last one. Wont get these again,1
7439,"These blinds do not stick to the windows. They fall off almost as soon as they are stuck on.  We had to hang them over the top of our shutters, rather than sticking them to the windows.",1
7440,These blinds used to be good but now the suction cups simply don't work even though bothe contact surfaces are thoroughly clean with window cleaner,1
7441,"These blinds were no good. Already haves roller blind and was hoping that this blind would block out the light from the top of the window. It didn't even stay on the window most of the time and when it did, it made absolutely no difference and was a hassle to take down. I will be returning this product.",1
7442,These came and stated on the front they where iPhone 6-6s screen protectors but they didn't fit my iPhone 6 screen the speaker hole was in the wrong place. Can't be returned total waste of money,1
7443,These do not fit n the iPhone 6s,1
7444,"These look nothing like in the picture, and they look very cheap, really basic and tiny box, the postage was ridiculous, there is no way it cost nearly £7 to post!  Very very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, how these were ever over £100 I will never know, basic, cheap looking and very very flimsy",1
7445,These screens are very thick but work fine when using the phone however both of them have already cracked so this must be a flawed design as other screen protectors I have used have lasted well over a year,1
7446,"These used to be biodegradable, but the company now say these are neither biodegradable or compostable. I won't be buying these again. So disappointed.",1
7447,"These used to be great, but are now different. No longer biodegradable (the major reason we bought them!) and now absolutely soaking. They smear poo around and are a NIGHTMARE to get out of the flipping packet!We use mainly washable wipes, (which we wash with our cloth nappies) although I occasionally buy wipes, but I am sure to buy biodegradable wipes as the poor environment can't cope with all the rubbish we are producing.I can't get over the producers if these not making it clear that these are no longer biodegradable. For us, it's naty wipes or Jackson Reece ones available from Sainsburys!Hope the manufacturers of these are reading this,.... Your product was great, but now it's total rubbish!",1
7448,"THESE WIPES ARE FAKE!!! as per photo the ones on the left are the real ones the ones on the right are what i recieved, there is hardly any fluid on them, they smell different, god knows whether there is a chemical in there, definately not water wipes!!!",1
7449,These wipes caused a nasty rash with our baby. Possibly a reaction to the fruit juice ingredient? Also a rather course wipe and not so good for doing cleanups. We switched to Johnson's baby wipes and have been fine ever since.,1
7450,"They are fake not the same ones you could buy from Tesco, you could smell the chemicals CHEAP CRAP",1
7451,They are much smaller than they appear  as above. Disappointed !,1
7452,They are not water wipes,1
7453,They are way too smaller than I what I thought they going to b.not too good thinking to return them.they don't lookMore worth than 5 pounds,1
7454,they came cracked,1
7455,they came un cracked despite poor packaging and they are pretty cheap so you get what you pay for but its like there not sticky enough of something it doesn't stick to the screen properly causing bubble like things on the screen on all the edges you can push down on them but they don't go away its annoying (this is straight after putting it on my screen) phones basically brand new and clean so that wasn't effecting it,1
7456,They contain so much water that they are cold to touch which makes baby cry (or pee). Too wet means you get 2 or 3 dispense at a time & then the next one is impossible to tease out.  I need to pat down my baby's skin before putting the nappy on otherwise the skin gets soft and red/damaged at the next change by nappy rubbing.  Overall a disaster.,1
7457,They dont stick and they dont keep the light out.Thats about it. I would look elsewhere to be honest,1
7458,They were both cracked upon delivery.,1
7459,They're ok... however they chip and scratch very easily. Rather on the protector but annoying to have to buy about 2-3 protectors a month,1
7460,This amazon fire is driving me crazy. You'll see my previous review below having eventually worked out how to download Netflix and CBeebies app so that I can download content for my son who is six to watch things. The device keeps unloading them and I have reload them what is going on? It's almost like amazon doesn't want me to watch rival content!Also I disapprove of a lot of the content that is automatically loaded on to the device from amazon and is not appropriate for my son. There were several programmes with zombie in the title etc. I have had to spend ages removing inappropriate content (which is great that I can do and isn't a feature on Netflix but really amazon should do more detailed checks on violent content). You can't change the order of what appears on the home page so he keeps getting drawn back to things before I can delete it. It seems to be taking a lot more effort on my behalf to make the device appropriate content for him to view / use!I found it pretty hard to set up the tablet to download apps we would have had on our previous iPad. Not easy for the parent to set up and I'm pretty good with these things.,1
7461,This at first was a very good toothbrush which gave an excellent clean. I bought this item in the end of November and now it's the end of March and the battery has failed miserably. After a 20hour charge it gives you 6 brushes of 2cm8nutes a piece. I can't believe the battery on this thing has given up the ghost so soon. I've never had a problem with braun before but now I'm concidering never going back  I don't know whether it's the Bluetooth running down the battery. But now I'm unimpressed and bitter as I've spent alot of money on a toothbrush which is rubbish. Thanks braun... not,1
7462,"This blind took forever to put up! It's selling point is it's simplicity so it's fallen at the first hurdle for me. The suction cups don't work, and it constantly falls down. Don't waste your money.",1
7463,"This blind unfortunately is rubbish. It doesn't stick to the window as the Velcro makes it too heavy. I think the grow company shouldn't have changed how they made them. I'm very disappointed, used mine a few times just to see if it would change my opinion but it hasn't. Worse £25 I've ever spent",1
7464,This book is so full of silly phrases used as fillers. ONLY appropriate word for this book would be RUBBISH,1
7465,"This book was very  hard work to read and very disappointing, unfortunately I would not recommend itPlot was very easy to work out",1
7466,"This came recommended to me as the best shaver to prevent shaving bumps/folliculitis so I took the plunge and purchased it, unfortunately it did not prevent bumps/folliculitis for me so I'm a bit annoyed at having spent a lot of money on a shaver I can't use. So much for recommendations. Hopefully others will have more luck.",1
7467,"This caused me one of the worded shaves in my life, I will admit I have bad acre however the level of ""red"" left on my face after giving up on my shave is terrible. My Gillette sheild razor does less damage with visible blade. Would not recommend.",1
7468,"This company used to make good wipes that were grape extract, biodegradable and smooth on baby's skin.They have completely changed the product and is NOT what they used to make only a few months back. Completely substandard product and I will not buy again.",1
7469,This does not come with UK Charger ???? Pls confirm before you buy,1
7470,This does not protect your phone. My daughter had this on her phone and the screan still smashed.  So pointless,1
7471,"this don't cut at all, I have a damp cloth that cuts better!",1
7472,this electric toothbrush only lasted 16 months I've bought two Now will not be buying another one they cost me over 80 pounds each,1
7473,"This got delivered just in the box the wipes come in and it was burst open and damp with packets of wipes missing, will never order these again!",1
7474,"This has been returned.  I bought this so my 5 year old could choose what he wanted to watch and download videos. However you are unable to download videos so can only watch where you have wifi. This isn't made clear even the customer services were not aware of this. Amazon need to make this clearer. There seems little point in paying extra for the kids version if you have prime, so I bought an ordinary 7. If they sorted this out it would be worth the money.",1
7475,"This has to be the worse electric shaver ever. I have always had rotary shavers before for over 25 years but thought I would give this one a go as I needed a new one. The shave leaves patchy bits and you have to go over at least 2 to 3 times before it is even remotely acceptable. the foil lasted about 8 months ( I still gave it a good go)  and I only shave about 3 times a week so I think you will be lucky to get 6 months out of it (cost of replacement head  about £25, new shaver about £40). I will be going back to either a Remington or Philips rotary and wish I had not wasted my money on this. PLEASE READ AND TAKE HEED OF THE OTHER 1 & 2 STAR REVIEWS.",1
7476,"This is a great toothbrush but the battery is a problem and makes the whole toothbrush useless when it goes. Like so many people giving this product one star I bought this series less than a year ago, to replace the last one which stopped charging, and it has done the same thing. The design is that it sits neatly atop its charger, flashing green to show that it's charging. For no reason, ours has stopped charging and just flashes red to show the battery needs charging. I have cleaned the charger but it won't charge the toothbrush. I will get another Oral B toothbrush but spend a lot less money on it as I don't use the functions on this one and the smiley face indicator that you've brushed well loses its excitement pretty quickly! It's a good clean but until oral B fix the battery problem, it's not worth the money. Those who have given it more than 2 stars must still be in the honey moon period for this toothbrush! I've had two now and both have ended the same way.",1

7478,"This is a horrific razor.  After 10 minutes of shaving, only my neck, I still had parts unshaven.  I was repeatedly going over the same spots and it not doing anything",1
7479,"This is a pretty good kit for the price, but the actual toothbrush is badly designed. When brushing your teeth, almost every time, the metal inside the brush head is rubbed away somehow and you end up with dark grey metallic tasting toothpaste in your mouth. Cannot recommend this product.",1
7480,"This is a very poor excuse for a paper trimmer, the blade is useless and doesn't cut in a straight line and it nearly destroyed the sheet of paper I was trying to cut. I had much more luck using scissors.",1
7481,"This is absolute cr@p! It cuts 1 sheet of paper at a time, 2 or 3 at a push, if your lucky. The guide is useless as it wobbles, so you don't end up with a straight line. It's pointless! The blade is obviously not sharp or is just too weak. This was a complete waste of money and it's been a total let down whilst I've tried to prepare print outs and games for a baby shower. Do not buy this!",1
7482,"This is an awful heap of muck of a tablet... Sure it has the ability of most other tablets but the advertisements wreck my head. The fact it has no official apps for YouTube, Google+ and many more is also pretty sad... I got this for my boy to play games on when he's bored but it's VERY hard to find any kids games that are free and he's not fond of it at all . This tablet is now gathering dust in a drawer somewhere. I can honestly say I'm sorry I bought it.",1
7483,"This is an awful product. The suckers do not stick to the window despite doing everything they recommend-clean windows, moisten, reshape. They constantly come off the window and it falls down",1
7484,"This is by far the hardest review I've had to write.I decided this year to make a switch from wet shaving to using an electric shaver, partially for long term cost saving and partially for ease. I did a fairly extensive search and decided upon this product when it was on sale as a part of Amazon's deal of the day!I want to preface this review by saying that I believe shaving is a very individual experience and what works for one person may not work for another and for me this product didn't work. Shaving with this product was impossible dry, even with multiple passes it left a patchy cut with longer hairs everywhere. I decided after that to wetshave and try again with shorter stubble. So I tried again the next evening at which point I still had a negative experience. I continued to try a couple more times over a week before I decided it was too much effort and went back to wet shaving.I've had better experiences with rotor based shavers than foil shavers in the past and I think that's the future. I feel like given the reviews this product just didn't work for me, and it may not work for everyone. So I was glad that Amazon's return policy had me covered and if you're in any doubt that's the thing to remember.",1
7485,This is by far the worst I have just bought it and used it once but it doesn't shave at all. It looks like my money went down the drain. I am not sure what to call it but it is anything other than a shaver,1
7486,this is by far the worst shaver I have ever purchased.The shaver pulls my beard hairs instead of trimming them. At first I thought I was not holding the shaver properly but later I found that there is something wrong with the shaver itself.I really regret purchasing this shaver.,1
7487,"This is completely useless - the suction pads just don't work and if you manage to get them to stick at all, it won't be for very long. Complete waste of money unfortunately.",1
7488,"This is definitely the worst shaver I have ever purchased - It won't even take away a single days growth. Anything over that forget it - even though the publicity blurb states it can handle a 3 day growth, no It can't. I expected better from a Braun but boy was I ever wrong - do yourself a favour and save your money go and buy one from your local German based supermarket, it'll save you money and you'll get a much better shave. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs",1
7489,This is my 2nd one after the 1st got replaced. Use to have the Triumph 9000 model previously and the battery needed to be charged only 12 hours for it to run 2 weeks flat twice a day. This one charges for 24 hours and didn't even give me a week. Shocking battery performance as i expect better from a newer model. STAY AWAY unless you want to poor battery operated unit.,1
7490,"This is RUBBISH! I bought for my sons room now the evenings are getting lighter and some of the suckers don't work! This means it drops down on the corner, or further, letting the light in and making the product redundant! Not impressed. Bought a brand name for a reason!",1
7491,This is rubish. These wipes are only half size. Really regret buying this useless wipes.,1
7492,"This is terrible! It’s not for kids at all, it’s all based around adults with a tiny section for children but you have to switch screens. I bought this for my Son for Christmas and decided to set it up tonight and thank god I did. I’m sure he would think that I’ve bought myself a tablet and I’m just letting him use it. So disappointing.",1
7493,"This is the most expensive disposable toothbrush mankind has ever seen. The handle is way too big and hard to hold. The brush speed is slow and the force is weak and so a brush takes forever and the toothpaste starts to drip down my hand and the big handle, making it all slippery. Yuck! The battery charge only lasts a few days. Yikes! And all the different speeds and electronic stuff is unnecessary. This is the one case where it does NOT make sense to go ""digital to the core"". (Is Gartner advising Oral-B?). A MUCH better product is the Philips brush that costs about £30, is thin, is fast, light, great brush, one simple speed and lasts for about 3 or 4 weeks - amazing! Oral B is much better at marketing but this brush is a waste of money. Philips makes a much better product, without question.",1
7494,"This is the third Oral-B toothbrush I have, and although the brush is fantastic, everything else let's it down. The Smart guide broke the first time it needed batteries. They have never lasted much more than a year, but this stopped working after 6 months. I should have returned it, but really couldn't be bothered.The app is completely pointless as it fails with it whole purpose for existence. It exists to keep track of your brushing. Regularly, it will drop several days, or even weeks, which makes it look as though you haven't been looking after your teeth. I have deleted the app and just the timer on my phone.It's very expensive considering so much doesn't work properly.",1
7495,This is the worst item I think I have ever bought it doesn't cut paper very well unless you press down extremely hard then there is a gap from where you want the line to be,1
7496,This is the worst razor I have ever bought.It can't even tackle the shortest hair and only use it for the beard trimmer as my previous Philips razor tugs a bit on 3 day plus growth and doesn't have a trimmer but apart from that beats this Braun hands down.So disappointed,1
7497,"this is the worst toothbrush ever the battery will not charge I've had 4 replacements, I've had a replacement charger... and the battery life still lasts less than one day... f I'm going to try and get an alternative model so p*ssed off with braun i would avoid and go get a philips sonicare!! obviously using cheap inferiror batteries that cannot hold any form of charge!!",1
7498,"This is the worst toothbrush I have ever  purchased! the battery will not charge fully, the timer does not connect, it is far to big and bulky I have returned it. Sadly I think I fell for the hype. I will stick with standard nor frills electric toothbrush from now on",1
7499,"This is the wrong product. It doesn't include beard trimmer!Looks like a fraud, don't buy this item.It costs 10 Pound more than the real one I got (without the trimmers).",1
7500,This item arrived and was unstable because one screen was cracked and broken and the other had a fault making it unusable.,1
7501,"This item does not work. I have tried to contact for a replacement, no success. I only bought last December and the battery failed in the summer. Only starting using since March this year. An electrical item (which you would expect a 1 year guarantee) and yet there is no option to return and replace. No contact link for the item either. Very frustrated. Do not buy from this company. If I would have purchased from Boots or Argos, could have taken back and replaced immediately.",1
7502,This item is essentially a great idea but is terrible to fit. The suction pads do not stick to the window and spend many frustrating hours trying to stick them back on only to fall off again. Do not buy.,1
7503,this item is not as good as it's says. the sucker don't attach to the window or the frame.I have had to use drawing pins to keep it in place,1
7504,This item says 12 packs but I only received 9 packs in the mail.,1
7505,"This item was meant to be new, Packaging undone, Really slow, Finger prints on the screen, Ending up lasting 3 months and it died.... Had to spend money on an ipad instead.... Stay clear.... Several attempts to contact and no reply.",1
7506,"This made my daughter get a bad rash and allergy reaction, it has a different smell to the ones we buy from big stores also packaging is different. This is not a real water wipes my daughter has really bad rash. I cant send pictures because its her private bit",1
7507,This may be in fact one of the WORST products that I've ever purchased.What and absolute waste of money! From suckers that don't keep the blind up to the Velcro that doesn't hold the blind in place to adjust the height or width.Giving this product one star is way to generous and it absolutely boggles my mind how this is a number 1 rated product.The only thing this blind had darkened is my mood when trying to put it up!Absolute junk.,1
7508,"This one is the 3rd one that I have bought, unfortunately, this one's battery only last for two days with a 20 hours full charge, the previous two went fine, but this one supposed to be my mother's gift, disappointed.",1
7509,"This Paper cutter is rubbish. Firstly its not wide enough for A4 paper horizontaly, & is no good for laminated paper, I have to cut it more than once!! Would not reccommend this item!!",1
7510,This product did not cut straight and the edging was appalling.Understandable for the price but nobody should create a product this shoddy!,1
7511,"This product does not shave the entire area evenly & leaves loads of bits. You also need to keep going over & over the same area to get a smooth finish.Used in the shower, it's even worse & less sharp.I can't believe this has come from Braun. I expected much higher quality; especially at this price.",1
7512,"this product doesnt charge up .. by the time i got around to using it , i could not return it!! NOT IMPRESSED IF I COULD GIVE MINUS STARS I WOULD",1
7513,"This product has caused my baby to get a severe nappy rash that ends up with her bleeding. It may be that she is specifically allergic to something in them but that would be odd as they are supposed to be water based.After cancelling out every other factor, I have realised that it is these wipes that are causing the rash. I'm really upset by this as I bought these wipes over others because they claim to be water based with barely any chemical component and, therefore, safe and gentle on baby skin.It is only now I have realised that her rash would clear up after I would visit my sisters house,  run out of these water wipes and use her chosen brand in place of them. Then when I would return home the rash would start back up again. The only difference in her nappy changing routine was the wipe brand!I have reordered a whole box full of these wipes and now I realise I have wasted my money.  These are not cheap in comparison to other brands. I was hoping to return them, but alas, I can't do that. So my money has gone down the drain.  I'm hoping the seller will contact me and take the box of my hands because its still unopened and I will not be using them anytime soon!",1
7514,"This product has hardly lasted anytime at all, it's lost nearly all the suckers even though I've followed all the instructions. I hope they read this review and resend another one out as I'm not very impressed",1
7515,This product has shrunk. Each wipe is now now smaller. Guess what. ...same price.,1
7516,This product is simply a disgrace! Caused my so to have a serious diaper rash and scream in pain!,1
7517,"This product is terrible. I purchased this product as I wanted a upgrade from my Braun series 3 shaver. As this product is series 9 I expected a huge difference in the shave: closer shave, smoother etc. I was utterly disappointed. The shave was terrible, it left hair and stubble, I had to go over the same area on my face several times to even get close to a smooth finish. I actually prefer my Braun series 3 shaver which is a fraction of the price (around £50). For the price DO NOT BUY!!!! Go buy a cheaper model or different make and the result is the same if not better",1
7518,"This product might be not the original,  this is the second time I have problem with this first one did not work good and second one stopped charging after less than three months.",1
7519,"This product was very disappointing. It didn't stick to the window, and was far too heavy for the stickers. I was very disappointed as I had been waiting for it to arrive and now have to return it and reorder something more suitable",1
7520,"This product works as described but if you intend to use it in real life it simply does not do the job. The cut is clearly not straight, the blade and the handle move sideways and you have no control whatsoever. The whole product seems badly designed and cheap.",1
7521,"This shaver is terrible. It's incredibly slow to use as it doesn't catch hairs with first, second or third attempts!Not recommended.",1
7522,This shaver might be OK for a young male with a soft stubble but I find it somewhat less than useless for my adult stubble.,1
7523,This shaver stopped working after only a few months!!,1
7524,"This shaver was absolutely useless for my oily sensitive skin type, first shave was pretty good but subsequent shaves were terrible, left lots of hairs left my face still feeling very course, and irritated and caused more shaving rash than I have ever had. Returned the shaver because it was so bad and have now gone back to wet blade shaving which I should never have left.",1
7525,This tablet DOES NOT support you tube or bbc i player - having read hundreds of reviews to ascertain whether it would support these apps I am extremely frustrated that it does not.. this is seemingly a new decision by amazon due to some ongoing spat with you tube.. Cheap nasty product which is no where near the quality of an iPad.. you get what you pay for here!! if you want a proper tablet which is actually functional then get yourself an iPad!!,1
7526,"This tablet was purchased as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves it. There are plenty of apps and games, educational and entertaining, so why such a poor review?...The tablet was bought in November 2017. Today, in July 2018, the sound cuts out intermittently and the tablet will not charge. It is useless. Not to worry, it was sold with a ""2 year worry free guarantee"", right? Wrong. When speaking with Amazon I was given a fairly extensive list of instructions to complete. I have listed these below. I have no idea whether this will fix the problem as the tablet is at home and I am at work. What I do know is that a product aimed at children should have a far better mechanism for updating software than this.Very disappointed.""In this case, restart the device by pressing and holding the power button for 40 seconds.After that charge the device using computer via USB cable.If you able to charge the device more than 40%, update the available software on your kids device.Determine your software version:Swipe down from the top of the screen and then tap Settings.Tap Device Options, and then tap System Updates.After updated the software then perform a factory reset on your kids Fire device.""",1

Within 9 months I could charge it all day and it would only run for about 10 seconds at a lower speed before stopping completely. They gave me a new one, not a refund.The bluetooth functionality is a gimmick, serves no useful purpose, and eats into battery life.The different modes are also pointless.Basic Oral-B electric brushes are essentially identical in terms of functionality but with better battery life.",1

I waited until the night before to set it up to maximise the Amazon kids subscription and was so disappointed with how slow it was that I was seriously considering not giving it to him. There is no option for the YouTube kids app so there it shows non child approved videos as well (frequently recommending news articles).The tablet as a whole is very slow which my son finds very frustrating. He had previously been using one of our 6 year old Samsung tablets which was more responsive with faster load times.To top it all off, after 3 months of use it's now only temporarily charging. 2 days and 1 night of charge and it's at 19%. This is advertised as have a 2 year 'no questions asked' warranty. I had to go through diagnostics with someone on an IM service before she placed an order for a refurbished tablet which will take nearly a week to arrive despite being a prime customer.All in all very disappointed. Should have bought a low end Samsung for the same price and an otterbox case.",1
7534,This was good for the first few items I needed cutting but now tears instead of cuts making my work messy!! Quite disappointed :(,1
7535,This was meant to be a pack of 9 and there were only 8 packs in the box. Mis-sold,1
7536,"This was sooooooo boring, I nearly gave up halfway through, but decided to persevere, wished I hadn't bothered now.",1
7537,This was terrible and I've had to send it back as it doesn't actually cut paper,1
7538,This would be a good product if it actually worked as its meant to. I have tried it on several different windows and the suction pads don't actually suck! It's either a complete design flaw or the material is just to heavy for the pads. Due to the light mornings I even resorted to trying to tape the blind up at the window but that didn't work either. The blind is just too heavy. Complete waste of money!,1
7539,Thoroughly disappointed with this device. Kids cannot access anything without a wifi connection and can only add purchased or rented content to the library! Completely defeats the object of having it for long journeys. My son spends all his time watching it using my profile so completely pointless having his own profile.Might as well get him an adult one for all the benefit he gets from this one.,1
7540,Those is tiny so not sure how many windows this will ever fit and it just kept falling off despite best endeavours.,1
7541,Thought the construction of the book was laboured; it did not grip me.,1
7542,"tiny cheap rubbish not like description, I would not buy them ever again, cheap tiny box also.",1
7543,To bigg for window they just look srupid,1
7544,To small for 8 inch Tablet it is total rubbish,1
7545,"To start with this toothbrush seemed good, albeit a little large and slippery when wet. After 6months the battery started going and has now completely died. Having spent so much on a toothbrush, i was expecting a lot better. Would never buy this model again.Avoid!!!",1
7546,Too big for any window and looks ugly when you have to pleat and fold it  to suit your wi Dow size as instructed do not buy,1
7547,Too flimsy and only cuts landscape view not portrait view. Blade is poor and won’t cut more than three pages on top of each other.,1
7548,Too much water. Goes mouldy towards the end of the packet! Wipes are quite thin. The Jackson Reece ones are better.,1
7549,Too small,1
7550,"Too small for an iPhone 6s. Looks like an iPhone 5 size.Although it comes in an iSOUL package, the package is open and the real product has been replaced with a plastic screen protector. Do not buy this!",1
7551,too small to cut a4,1
7552,Too strong...too complicated!,1
7553,Toothbrush worked properly for the first week. Then it started to run out of power. It's now not working at all. I would not recommend this. Would have been better to buy one on hte high street where it would be easier to return if there was a problem. Expensive rubbish!,1
7554,"Top left of the case was dinted at the back, I needed a case really bad as you can see I didn't sent it back , I am very unhappy",1
7555,"Total garbage, used it for a month-all of a sudden it decides to lock up in travel mode & refuses to release, except for when it decides to switch on randomly for a few seconds. Not as great a shave as advertised either. Had problems with Braun shavers in the past, but thought their top range would be different-obviously not. Now find I cannot even send it back to Amazon for a refund. Thanks a million-wasted a lot of money on a totally over-hyped & useless item, will go back to using Panasonic-a company you can actually rely on.",1
7556,"Totally not fit for purpose. You've got to press down extremely hard on the ruler portion to get a clean cut, and even then you need to go over it a few times for it to work correctly. I have no idea how this has good reviews or is a 'Best Choice' item. It is made VERY poorly.",1
7557,"Tried connecting this to my iPad air and my Huawei P9 both support Bluetooth 4.0. this thing would not connect.I get the following; when using the appTurn on your toothbrush on - I didToothbrush detected, connectingAfter 30 seconds it asks me to turn on the toothbrush again to detect the toothbrushThen it asks to turn the toothbrush off etcCannot for life of me connect this thing.After reading app reviews, it seems I am not the only one",1
7558,"Trying way too hard with metaphors and analogies, made me think she didn't trust the story. Sorry I paid as much as 99p. Would have been zero stars but not an option.",1
7559,"Ugly looking, doesn't fit very well and the suckers constantly fall off the window. Will be getting a refund - just purchase a sleeping mask if you need darkness for sleep!",1
7560,"Uk 2 pin plug is so terrible ,it wont fit regular adapter and you need two in order to use in Europe...see the vid on youtube",1
7561,"Underpowered, slow, buggy. Cannot display your apps, rather the whole App Store for kids all the time. Put the money towards a real tablet",1
7562,"Undoubtedly the worst shave I've had.  I bought it because it is easier to travel with an electric razor, but now I feel like a complete idiot.  My whole facial hair (1 day growth) is spotty because of the exceedingly poor quality of this razor.  Skip this.",1
7563,"Unfortunately I have to agree with the negative reviews. Have tried different tactics suggested, but the suckers are useless and it falls off after a short while.",1
7564,Unfortunately made our 2 day old go red and break out. Advised to stop using and go for water and cotton wool. Problem cleared up. Not suitable for all babies skin.,1
7565,Unfortunately this blackout blind is rendered quite useless by the very poor quality suction cups that it uses.  The blackout blind itself is fine and blocks out light  but it is an exercise in frustration trying to get it to stick to the window (if indeed it will).,1
7566,Unfortunately this product requires charging everyday and even after charging through the night the battery only states it is two thirds charged. When using for the first time after being charged it runs out of battery within 3/4 minutes.  Very disappointing.,1
7567,unfortunately this shaver shaves terrible.  I expect something more from Braun. It's working even worse like the one cheaper which I have at home. Very disappointing,1
7568,Unfortunately this worked for a week or so and the stopped... No idea why it just gave up.  Had to send back and get a refund.,1
7569,"Unfortunately, this breast pump did not have enough suction on it for me to use. I tried it with and without the comfort cushion but I just couldn’t get a good fit and strong suction. I tried for ages and only got few drops, whilst the pump in the hospital had been drawing out 100ml in 10 minutes. I had to give up and go with the brand I had been using in the hospital.  Time is very precious when you only have a few hours before the baby wakes up again.  The instruction manual was unclear, actually blurry in places, and it was tricky to put together. This might have been my baby brain though.",1
7570,unhappy.,1
7571,Unit doesnt grip phone consistently so straight to the bin i am afraid,1
7572,Unless you have an avid interest in the sun and moon eclipse you'll find the beginning of this book drones on & on about it to the point where you lose the will to carry on reading it. I can only thank my lucky stars that I downloaded a sample before wasting my money buying it & can only advise others do the same.,1
7573,Unreadable rubbish - gave up at 2% read.  Torture,1
7574,"UPDATE: I have given up, after talking to The Gro Company and I have arranged to return it.----------------------------------------------------Sadly one star, as I cannot get the blind to stick to the window, despite contacting the company, being sent a daunting list of instructions to clean the window, soak the suction cups etc, etc.I've tried and tried - but it's like spinning plates - you get one to stick, another unsticks - there's no way I could get this to work night after night. I agree with another reviewer that it seems the curtain is too heavy for the suckers.Having said that, the black out effect of the curtains is superb - as I've tried it draped over a partition door - but that's not the place I wanted to use it.",1
7575,"Used once, then returned. Even after repeatedly going over the same areas this left so many rough patches that I resorted to the wet razor. Waste of time.",1
7576,"Used these with my first born a couple years ago. They were good. No skin irritation and soft on skin. No grumbles. Decided to use them again on my second baby in Jan 2014. However, the composition seems to have changed. They are much coarser and don't seem as moist. They seem to drag across my newborn baby's skin, which ultimately led to nappy rash. Immediately changed to cotton wool and water and rash disappeared. Perhaps try a single pack before purchasing a box of 12.",1
7577,Useless and expensive. Returned the following day. Shaving with this shaver is like playing whack a mole with your face.,1
7578,Useless it broke my phone and the protector was in tact,1
7579,Useless the suckers don't stick. Should have read the reviews.,1
7580,"Useless when it comes to the standard single bedroom houses used practically everywhere I've seen. A pain to set up when you've got to fold all the velcro together to make it fit, then some of the suction cup will randomly give up and fall off.I figured this would be less hassle than putting up a roller blind, which involves drilling and such, I was wrong.",1
7581,"useless, does not state that it does not work outside UK",1
7582,"Useless, the suction pads are not working",1
7583,Useless. Doesn't sick,1
7584,"Useless. I tried to put this up about a thousand times and a thousand times it fell down,  I want my life back. I'll be sending this back for a refund. Total rubbish.",1
7585,"Useless. Meant to be able to fit onto any size window but completely rubbish, light still gets through folds. Would give 0 stars if I could. Don't waste your money or buy second hand for cheap as very expensive product for brand new",1
7586,USELESSPROVIDE ERROR AT ADDING MY CHILD'S PROFILE. NOT A SOLUTION GIVEN BY CUSTOMERS' SERVICE YET,1
7587,"Usually when I buy tempered glass screen protectors they can last for months, however these both broke within the first 4 days of use! Wouldn't buy them again as they are not good quality.",1
7588,Utter tosh. Completely unbelievable plot. Don't waste your time. No idea how this is a best seller - clearly plenty of suckers like me.,1
7589,Utterly useless. Does not stick to any window. Totally avoid unless you enjoy things falling off your window during the night.,1
7590,"Utterly useless. Have tried it in three different places, cleaned the window first etc etc. No matter what we do, the stupid thing won't stay up and just falls down. Avoid.",1
7591,Very amateurish!,1
7592,very annoying thing... blocks the light nicely but doesn't stick to the window at all even after fighting it for 15 minutes and doing everything i could think of,1
7593,very bad quality. The suction cups don't hold on any window no matter how clean they both are. Definitely not recommended.,1
7594,Very bad! It works but takes a lot of effort it's easier to use a normal razor,1
7595,"Very big to handle, very noisy. The pulse touch very sensitive.",1
7596,Very boring. The heroes make all the wrong choices on purpose.,1
7597,Very cheap looking and irritation to my ears.,1
7598,Very difficult to use especially in a changing nappy situation. All wipes clump together in one large lump and it is very difficult to separate them. I also thought it would reduce nappy rash etc but seemed to have the same effect as any other baby wipes,1
7599,very disapointed,1
7600,Very disappointed !!!!  Iv had this 6 wks and its discolourd  ...waste of money sorry !!!,1
7601,Very disappointed in this product. It wont cut paper properly and is extremely flimsy.,1
7602,Very disappointed that the wipes are now significantly smaller and thinner. Not the high quality product I have been used to. I have been buying these exclusively for the last 18 months but now will probably go back to using one of the other brands.,1
7603,"Very disappointed this is the second one I have had in only 2 months, I’m usually really happy with Amazon products but this is not good, the first one crashed so I tried to reset and a cracking noise happened almost like it blew up and then wouldn’t turn back on, the second one I have received the volume buttons and lock buttons don’t work all the time",1
7604,Very disappointed to find only 1 screen protector in the pack. Not happy.,1
7605,Very disappointed with item.  Will not send for this type of item in the future.,1
7606,Very disappointed with this my old 3 rotary head Philips did a better job would not recommend this shaver.,1
7607,Very disappointed with this product after using for 3 days my baby has developed a red irritated rash anywhere the wipes touched his skin.,1
7608,Very disappointed with this product....the battery life is very limited. After only 3 months of use the battery is depleted after each use and therefore I need to constantly keep it on the charger. I didn't find the Bluetooth functionality any useful - in fact it may be the reason the battery is so short-lived.,1
7609,Very disappointed with this product...shaved the face and when I got to the neck it didn’t shave anymore...I had to use a razor blade to finish ...Braun ...German brand made in China... bad quality,1
7610,"Very disappointed, continuously crashing on the kids app in the kids profile. Was very tricky to set up considering I do IT for a living, ended up sitting on google for an hour and worked out apps needed force resetting. Have had to do it twice since then. Little one is now fed up and wants my iPad. Thanks Amazon! Usually so good",1
7611,"Very disappointed, does not hold iPhone up without dropping forward which is very annoying. Therefore not fit for purpose, and will have to look for something suitable.",1
7612,"Very disappointed, screen came cracked. Would like to be sent a new one.",1
7613,"Very disappointed,this wipes does not clean properly,I was expecting something much better considering the price",1
7614,Very disappointed! The sucker pads didn't stick on a number of different Windows on our holiday. Or when they stick they came down an hour later! I need to buy Velcro Fastenings now.,1
7615,Very disappointed. Will not stick to window and unable to find out how to get a replacement,1
7616,Very disappointing as does not stick to window.  Would like a refund on this.,1
7617,Very disappointing purchase. The carousel screen had blank icons and despite any advice I followed the issue seemed unresolvable. Looking on here I found reviews stating the same and that a replacement was the only solution. But other reviews state that the error sometimes happens then returns to normal. Not good enough. Returned. Will be buying an iPad instead.,1
7618,Very disappointing that the size of the wipes and the quality has been greatly reduced although the price remains the same. I've been using these wipes for close to a year but will now consider changing. This is purely for profit and very disappointing,1
7619,"Very disappointing, as I have used Braun shavers all my life.  I feel that the cheaper razors work much better and have been fooled into paying unnecessary amount of money for a shaver that doesn't not meet the expectations promoted.  Shaver does not give a close shave, has to be used for a long time, but still leaves hair on the face,",1
7620,"Very disappointing, picture is very deceiving. If I had paid full price these would be going straight back",1
7621,Very disappointing. Dose hold charge very well. I bought the 4000 for my daughter and that was cheaper and works better,1
7622,Very flat looking with unsafe looking tassel on tail. Not appropriate for a small baby as I had hoped.,1
7623,Very flimsey.Not what I wanted at all.,1
7624,"very flimsy ,doesnt cut true as to much movement on the blade",1
7625,Very flimsy and not what it looks like it's really hard to cut the paper and won't take a4.To be honest I'd have gave it no stars if I could have,1
7626,Very flimsy!,1
7627,Very flimsy.  Inaccurate cutting very dissapointed,1
7628,Very hard to get into and did improve but wouldn't recommend,1
7629,Very hard to stick them on a glass window.,1
7630,"Very loud, when brushing your teeth its hard to keep it in hand couse vibrates like  electric drill,  sonic toothbrushes are 10 times better",1
7631,"Very low quality compared to the other water wipes we have had, the wipe feels very rough.",1
7632,Very poor,1
7633,Very poor quality,1
7634,"Very poor quality devices. Bought two of them for my kids and both of them take hours to charge. Quality of the device is not that good either. I would recommend to spend a bit more money and buy a proper iPad (apple or samsung). Just got a refund for one. Will try another for another week(replacement), if same issues, will have to refund ghg too",1
7635,Very poor quality.  Going to return,1
7636,Very poor quality. Disappointing product. Suckers misshaped and do not sick to the window. I wonder if this has been damaged while in storage??,1
7637,Very poor shave quality. Doesn't get to most hair.,1
7638,"Very poor shave results. Tried both wet and dry shaves. Doesn't come anywhere close to close shave. Reid with a 4 day old as well as 1 day old beard, in both cases it just trimming not shaving, no matter how hard you try. Just waste of time and money. Must say packaging and ergonomics are great. Obvious for Braun.",1

7640,VERY POOR SHAVE. HURTS TO USE.ABSOLUTE RUBBISH !!!!!!!,1

7646,Very small.,1
7647,Very very low in quality! Get dirty very quickly.,1
7648,"Very, Very dissapointed that I purchased this for my child, yet I can't play audible books that I bought for them on it. I can do it on their existing tablet, this is completely crazy.I have always been happy with Amazon services, and use many of their content systems, but really dissapointed with this.",1
7649,Warning!!!!not fit for purpose.  Do not buy this product!!!! I have two broken windows because of this product. The blind is black and therefore attracts the sun. I live in Ireland. It's not even that sunny.,1
7650,Was charged for the unlimited kids zone £7.99 when it was supposed to be free for a year.,1
7651,was complete waste of money.if your hairs are even littlest tuff . save your money then.,1

7654,"was working good, but only for 5 months. after that I was charging it overnight, it was red hot in the morning and never turned on again. disapointed with the Braun quality. I had Philips before which lasted me over 10 years...",1

7656,"Waste of money .After 16 months despite being fully charged this electric toothbrush has stopped working, just after a year old there was  occasional delayed starting would ocurr after pushing the start button ..but now won't work stall ...Useless !!",1

7658,Waste of money fulls part way off the window constantly after night shift it will be returned,1
7659,Waste of money. First one split when applying it to the phone. The second one cracked within 48hrs. I have used different versions of these that are way better. Would not buy these particular ones again totally useless product !,1

7661,Waste of money. Wouldn't stick to the window and I want my money back ASAP!!!,1

7663,"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DOSN'T WORK PROPLY. GOT A REFUND, INSTEAD IT DAMAGED A PHOTO OF MINE! HATE THIS PRODUCT, MADE AND FEELS VERY CHEAP.",1
7664,Waste of time no content available with product support for product just awful,1
7665,"WaterWipes, is sold as “The world’s purest baby wipes”, because they contain “99.9% water and a drop of fruit extract”. But on investigation, the wipe material itself is actually 80% polyester and 20% viscose. So not exactly made from water. Nor, you could argue, particularly pure, in some senses.",1
7666,"We bought 2 of these, 1 would not recharge after 5 months.  Great whilst it worked.",1
7667,"We bought this for traveling and unfortunately this device is only designed for use with a UK wifi connection. Good luck downloading content for offine viewing (restricted, except amazon original content), or using it abroad (content controls prevent usage from a non-uk IP address).",1
7668,We have replaced two tablets and now about to take the third one back to John Lewis (who have been brilliant in replacing them). Tablets have been slow and frequently fail to load apps and books. Very frustrated and disappointed with this product and would not recommend it.,1
7669,"We have used this product plenty times before but the latest batch we are very disappointed with as they were not wet at all and they had a strange, fragranced smell which they shouldn't have.",1
7670,We purchased the 15 pack box previously but this time we had to purchase the 'value 9 pack box' as it's no longer avaliable. The difference is that the old wipe packets with 72 wipes are much better quality compared to the 60 wipe packs. It looks like they have reduced the quality and quantity of the wipes and are repackaging them as a smaller 'value 9 pack box' to hide this . We will not be purchasing these again.,1
7671,We purchased this for our 2 and a half year old and unfortunately did not live up to expectations. Within hours of the device arriving it continually cut off and when I rang to ask for advice we were told it is a known fault that has no solution. We were not made aware of this prior to purchase and for a child with mild learning difficulties this is not great! Very disappointed with this device.,1
7672,"We tried this on multiple windows, using everything we could think of to make it stick but it just doesn't. Useless.",1
7673,"We used to buy these Water wipes from this seller for about a year, they were the best baby wipes on the market- no odour, nappie rash or irritation... Last week I ordered another batch, just to get biggest disappointment! Manufacturers have changed the product, it has new packaging with heart at the front, it's produced in 2015- and those wipes SMELL OF DIRTY FEET! I opened another pack from the box- same smell! The last pack I had was produced in 2014 and it didn't smell of anything , they were very refreshing for the skin after wiping... These new wipes leave my babies skin smell badly! Why would you destroy perfectly brilliant product, just for a bit of make over??? I will try to find Water wipes produced 2014, as these "" updated"" ones are good for the bin only.",1
7674,"We're now on our second one of these and the battery life is appalling. It was fully charged and has lasted 5 brushes. The last of which, it said there was 2/3 battery left and it died half way through. Very noisy too.",1
7675,"We've been using these wipes for nearly a year and have been very happy with the quality and performance....until the latest batch arrived.The manufacturer has sneakily reduced the size of the wipes whilst maintaining the same number within each pack and retaining the old price.  We now end up using more for each nappy change and have found the effectiveness has also deteriorated, so I suspect there has been a change in the formulation/quality of materials used.Needless to say we have cancelled our subscription and are moving a different brand.  Well done bean counters, you've lost another customer!",1
7676,"Well I bought this toothbrush a year ago but did not need to use it until recently.  I have used it for a couple of months when all of a sudden it decided that it had not spent the night charging but was completely dead.  I managed to get it to charge again but some features, e.g. pausing after each quadrant of the month have disappeared.  Now I don't trust it and have resorted to buying a cheap sonic toothbrush with mainly five star reviews.  It only takes 4 hours to charge not all day and night.",1
7677,"Well I had given 5* before, but it is changing to 1* as product has changed so much! I am writing this to inform you on what sort of changes these are and what is the outcome.My son is 9 months old and I've been using these wipes ever since he was born. Started with 4 pack, then bought 12 pack in December and another 12 pack now. First couple times wipes were amazing, I was bragging about their quality and how they keep my LO skin clear of skin conditions etc. But all have changed, with this last 12 pack.First change I've noticed was packaging - longer and narrower, than before. I am not just saying it, I actually have proof. See my pictures. Let me tell you the SIZE of them HAVEN'T CHANGED at all, it's the WAY THEY are PACKED in the pack that they seem smaller when they actually not, have compared them to old ones. Pictures reflects what I am saying is true. You can even see difference in material. Now the QUALITY has radically CHANGED! Wipes before were softer and now they are rough when touching...So after using these ""new"" wipes for few days, I have noticed my son is trying to pull of his nappy! His bum is red and itchy by the looks of it! I am also using these wipes to wipe off his face after we had some food...and guess what, eczema is riddling his face!!! Are you serious? So clean and skin friendly product makes my sons skin go bonkers in few days! Which begs the question, are they really using water and fruit extract only? And we haven't changed any products we are using, same washing stuff, same cream, same nappies and nappy cream, same bathing routine!These wipes are not worth the money anymore... I do not recommend!",1
7678,"Well it’s good. Child likes it.If I was posting for parental co tells it would get 5 stars.But it went wrong within 3 months of owning it. It froze while watching something. I turned off and on again. Redound program and it stuttered frozenwent black and never came back on. Amazon agreed to swap it.It’s only then I found that you get a refurbished Fire. Had this a month and it’s always been slower than the new one, and now it’s decided not to show items on the main children’s screen and the sound intermittently plays up.Nothing bad has happened to either of these Fires so I’m a more than a bit angry.So do be aware.",1

So no luck for my kid.Nowhere on the box is written this information.It should be made clear that anyone who is not from these countries should NOT BUY A KINDLE FIRE FOR KIDS.I almost forgot it has a lot of light bleed around the edges.I would give this tablet 0 stars but it is not possible.",1

7686,"What a waste of time. Misses parts of your face frequently when you shave. And shave is just not close enough when it does work as intended. Worst of all when you send it back for a refund it gets delayed. I am still waiting after 17 days to see if I will get a refund, maybe this is just amazon or post office being naff but has been much easier to return other items. What a waste. I have learnt my lesson and will stick to wet shave razors.",1

7689,"What can I say.No instructions on set up or how to add a child, a simple link supplied by Amazon on setup would eleviate all the issues I experienced.Incorrect original setting supplied by Amazon meant it was set for USA, as such spent literally hours trying to register the free Amazon Fire for Kids but unable to find app as the Americans call it FreeTime Unlimited.Spent 40 min on the phone trying to explain to customer services that it should come with the product to tell me they had cured the problem to send me an email to say about payment.....Eventually realised that the subscription Amazon was trying to force on me was in dollars.Checked country code to find it registered to USA.Change to UK, about an hour ago and still set to USA.Still not working correctly and feeling very frustrated with the whole Amazon experience.Cannot tell you how much I wish we never bought in the first place.",1
7690,"What kind of electric cord is it-  Cannot figure out wether it's an EU standard plug on the end of the recharging wire or wether its some new odd standard....Any way I cannot use this recharger in Denmark (EU), for some reason.",1
7691,"When buying a shaver you probably want a few main attributes; these being comfort, practicality  and for the pissing thing to cut your hair. The only things I can see this being useful for is either as a mains powered vibrator as the funking thing was giving me hand arm vibration syndrome while using it, or as a lethal weapon as the bastarding thing cuts you the funk up. The problem with this shaver is that it just doesn't shave, I spent 30 minutes rubbing it along my neck  line and came out looking like I'd attacked my pubic bush with a set of craft scissors and I in no way have thick hair... Getting a refund, this is s***e, don't buy.",1
7692,When I order this saver it reached on time but When i used it one of the blade removed quickly and feeling very bad and waste of money,1
7693,"When I was purchasing the order I was looking for an 100% transparent case which I seen here, however when it came it arrive with white small small dots all over the cover which was quite annoying for me however others might find it over to work with, personally this product should of been stated that it wasn't 100% transparent",1
7694,When it arrived it was broken. Lots of bits had broken off and doesn't work properly due to this,1
7695,"When this cutter arrived it was called on the packaging a photo trimmer, this is not at all what I wanted and is not as described on the webpage. It says in the description that you can cut laminated documents with it, I think not and certainly not with the one that I have been sent. It is flimsy and does not cut well at all. I can't see it lasting. A complete waste of money.",1
7696,When this product is first on the window it really is a great product but within minutes of it being up the suckers loose suction and it falls off in stages. It is a real shame as if it stayed up it would be fabulous. Sadly it doesn’t and therefore can only give it 1 star as doesn’t do the job it’s intended for.,1
7697,When this was on it effected my iPhone screen sensitivity so I removed and threw away. It wouldn’t let me hold down on the screen on a snapchat vid for example and would click into things when trying to scroll. I put it on following the instructions,1
7698,"Where was the shock ending? This book irritated me from the start with ts interminable pretentious, cryptic hints, much of it was like watching paint dry, and I could feel the denouement developing as the only obvious conclusion.  And the incessant use of crass language sickened me.",1
7699,While it may be easy to use MY SCREEN SMASHED AND THE PRODUCT REMAINED INTACT! Absolutly nothing about this screen protector protected my screen!,1
7700,why it doesn't match with any transformer？,1
7701,Will not stick to window tried everything even duck tape not happy for the price of it either!,1
7702,Wipes are TOO wet and they smell of alcohol to me. Definitely not worth the price !,1
7703,Wipes were completely dry and had to be thrown in the bin!,1
7704,Wipes were dated to expire 24/7/2015.  I ordered them in August 2015.  Two boxes of unusable wipes!,1
7705,Won't cut at all,1
7706,Worked efficiently for about 3 weeks. The pump has now lost half its power and I can hear air being sucked in. I can't return it as the window for return has closed even though it is faulty and I only bought it 4 weeks ago. I'd recommend buying a different branded electric pump to avoid this issue.,1
7707,"worked well for ,2 months then for last month not doing the job. I want it replaced but can't find out how to do the complaint on amazon. help",1
7708,Worst brush the battery doesn't works anymore holds charge for one time brushing only after a full charge,1
7709,Worst delivery man ever so rude! But the product is the best,1
7710,Worst experience ever avoid if u can. Got 2 of them from Santa to the kids and endless problems with kids profiles not connecting and now 3 months in one of them has packed in will not charge at all.,1
7711,"Worst razor I've ever used, gone from a Philips circular razor to this. This takes forever to cut, have to spend ages going over and over the same area to cut the simplest of areas. Please do not buy this razor unless you want to spend hrs shaving.",1
7712,Worst thing ever. Yea i followed instructions to put it up it isn't rocket science i really needed it for day time naps. Turn by turn suction cups fall off. Cheaply made not worth the price,1
7713,Worst toothbrush ever uncomfortable to use and have to keep recharging it,1
7714,Worst wipes ever! They smell like alcohol and they are not the original ones! DO NOT BUY THEM!,1
7715,"Would be a great item if it actually stuck to the window!! It’s rubbish no matter what you do they’ll stick for a minute then fall down. Not happy with this purchase, would not recommend",1
7716,Would be great if they stuck to the window. The suction pads are very hit and miss. Most times the blind falls down within minutes.,1
7717,Would have been brilliant but the suction pads don't stick to the window,1
7718,"Would love to be able to say what they looked like, but they were so small I couldn't tell. Not worth the price even at the £7.19 I paid. Was supposed to be a present for a relative, but I am too embarrassed by the size and quality and they have been returned for a refund.",1
7719,Would not stick to window no matter how much i cleaned it was just frustrated by the end of this experience,1
7720,Wouldn't buy again. Does not cover the entire screen of an iPhone 6S.,1
7721,"Wouldn't even give it 1 star! It's useless, won't stay stuck on the window - even with industrial tape!",1
7722,"Wouldn't recommend this product, it's a pain to fix to the window, it doesn't stick well at all. There's got to be a better alternative out there.",1
7723,"Wouldn't stick to any window in our home. We have bought these in the past but this one just wouldn't stay up at all, not one sucker",1
7724,Wouldn’t recommend. Very big and no better than a cheap Oral-B.,1
7725,wrong brush came,1
7726,Wrong item posted. I received a one direction cd instead of the screen protector,1
7727,Wrong item sent too small for screen.,1
7728,"Yes it blocks out the light very well but the suction cups are useless and don't stick to the window properly, they either keep falling off or don't stick at all!",1
7729,"Yes, it's better than the 7 series, but don't change until your old model needs replacing.  And don't buy it for anywhere near full price (I got it on a lightning deal).Updated review.  15 months on, my foil & cutter has just broken (and I don't shave every day), so needs to be replaced.  And guess what, there's a shortage of foils and the only ones you can get straight away are ludicrously over-priced.  Reports I've read tell of the foils not lasting the 18 months recommended.  Avoid.",1
7730,You could buy better at the pound shop! This Trimmer does not even fit an A4 sheet of paper long ways!!!!!!! and the blade can only just cut through a piece of paper!,1
7731,"You need to go over paper a few times to get it cut properly, doesn't take many pieces of paper & a bit difficult to line up & get a straight finish",1
7732,"You would have more chance of cutting photos using a butter knife then you would with this thing.... flimsy, ruler moves when trying to cut and the blade doesn't cut through the card/photo. Enough said!",1
